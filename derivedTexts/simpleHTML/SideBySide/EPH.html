<p id="Disclaimer">Note: This is still a very early look into the unfinished text
    of the <em>Open English Translation</em> of the Bible.
Please double-check the text in advance before using in public.
Some things (like capitalisation of ‘him’ referring to Jesus or ‘father’ referring to God)
    in the <em>RV</em> haven’t been decided yet so we’re still testing both ways.</p>
<p>Note: The <em>Readers’ Version</em> on the left is a translation
into contemporary English aimed at <i>the person on the street</i> who
hasn’t necessarily been brought up with exposure to Biblical jargon and/or 500-year old English.
It’s designed to be used alongside the <em>Literal Version</em> on the right which gives
the English reader a window into what’s actually written in the original languages.
(See the <a href="index.html#Intro">introduction</a> for more details—we
recommend that you read the introduction first if you’re wanting to fully understand the <em>Literal Version</em>.)
By comparing the left and right columns, you should be able to easily get the message of the text,
while at the same time keeping an eye on what it was actually translated from.</p>
<p>Note that <span class="RVadded">greyed words</span> in the <em>RV</em> are words that the translators
consider were most probably in the mind of the writer, but as none of us can double-check
with the original speakers or writers, the reader is free to disagree.
They are clearly marked because we’ve tried to be as honest and transparent as possible.</p>
<p>The <span class="added">lighter coloured words</span> in the <em>LV</em> are words which
aren’t needed in the grammar of the original languages but are required or implied in English.
You can read the <a href="index.html#Key">Key</a> to learn more about them.
The underlines in the <em>LV</em> show when one original language word needs to be translated into two or more English words.
(Just hide them with the button if you don’t need that information and find it distracting.)
Also, the majority of sentences in the <em>LV</em> don’t have the words
put into a sensible English order yet.
(This should be completed by the end of 2023.)</p>
<p>The <span class="nominaSacra">bold words</span>
in the <em>LV New Testament</em> are
<a href="https://BibleQuestions.info/2020/01/25/what-are-nomina-sacra/">words</a>
that the original writers or copyists
marked to indicate that they considered them to refer to God.
<small>(Sadly, this information is not displayed in most Bible translations,
especially since it seems to clearly confirm that the earliest writers/copyists
considered both Jesus and the Holy Spirit to be God.)</small></p>
<p class="mt2">Paul's letter to the </p>
<p class="mt1">believers in Ephesus</p>
<p class="shortPrayer">It is our prayer that the
<em>Open English Translation</em> of the Bible will give you a clear understanding of
the accounts and messages written by the God-inspired Biblical writers.</p>
<div class="bookIntro"><p class="is1">Introduction</p>
<p class="is2">The author</p>
<p class="ip">This <span class="bk">Letter to the believers in Ephesus</span> was written by Paul from prison in Rome.</p>
<p class="is2">This letter</p>
<p class="ip">This letter wasn’t just written for the assembly of believers there in Ephesus, but also for other assemblies of believers.</p>
<p class="ip">Paul’s main theme is about God’s plan that “at the right time he will gather everything, whether in heaven or here on earth, for the messiah” (1:10).</p>
<p class="ip">In the first part of letter, he wrote about unity. Paul carefully explained about how God the father chooses his people, about forgiving and saving them from their sins through his son, Jesus the messiah.</p>
<p class="ip">In the second part of letter, Paul urges the reader that the believers need to be united in the messiah by means of their unity with each other.</p>
<p class="ip">Paul uses many allegories about the unity of people with God via the messiah: the believers are the body of the messiah, he is the head; it’s like a house, with the messiah as the foundation stone; the believers are also like a bride with the messiah as the groom.</p>
<p class="ip">It’s also explained here about the correct behaviour of couples, of parents and children, and of slaves and master. Then in concluding his letter, it’s explained about the armour that’s given to believers for them to use to stand against Satan’s attacks.</p>
