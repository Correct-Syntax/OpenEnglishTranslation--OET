<p>Note: This is still a very early look into the unfinished text
    of the <em>Open English Translation</em> of the Bible.
Please double-check the text before using in public.
Some things (like capitalisation of “him” referring to Jesus or “father” referring to God)
    in the <em>RV</em> haven’t been decided yet so we’re still testing both ways.</p>
<p>Note: The <em>Readers’ Version</em> on the left is a translation
into contemporary English aimed at <i>the person on the street</i> who
hasn’t necessarily been brought up with exposure to Biblical jargon and/or King James English.
It’s designed to be used alongside the <em>Literal Version</em> on the right which gives
the English reader a window into what’s actually written in the original languages.
(See the <a href="index.html#Intro">introduction</a> for more details—we
recommend that you read the introduction first if you’re wanting to fully understand the <em>Literal Version</em>.)
By comparing the left and right columns, you should be able to easily get the message of the text,
while at the same time keeping an eye on what it was actually translated from.</p>

<div class="bookIntro"><p class="is1">Introduction</p>
<p class="is2">Author</p>
<p class="ip">This account about the works and teachings of Jesus was written by John, brother of James--both of them were in the small group of twelve close followers of Jesus that he selected as His apprentices and who accompanied Him around as He taught. Out of them, John was the one that greatly loved Jesus, and his closeness gave him much of the insight that he includes with his description of Jesus’ actions and teaching. The two brothers were the sons of Zebedee, and they had all worked on the Lake of Galilee as fishermen.</p>
<p class="is2">This account</p>
<p class="ip">We place John’s account before the others because it begins with the eternal existence of Jesus the Messiah. Not only is Jesus the godly messenger, he was also the creator who has now descended from heaven as a man. Omitting any mention of the baby Jesus, John does however tell us about John the Immerser who came before Jesus to prepare the people for the arrival of the promised Messiah.</p>

<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C3V3">3 </span>Jesus responded,  “I’ll tell you frankly that no one can enter God’s kingdom unless he is reborn.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C3V4">4 </span>Nicodemus questioned,  “How could an old person be reborn? He can’t just return to his mother’s womb and then get born again!”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C3V5">5 </span>And Jesus continued,  “Honestly, I’m telling you: unless a person is born from both water and the spirit, they can’t enter God’s kingdom. <span class="V" id="C3V6">6 </span>Someone that’s born from a body is flesh, but someone that’s born from God’s spirit is spiritual. <span class="V" id="C3V7">7 </span>You shouldn’t be surprised that I told you that everyone needs to be reborn. <span class="V" id="C3V8">8 </span>The wind blows wherever it wants, and you hear its sound but you can’t actually see where it’s coming from and where it’s going. So too with everyone born from God’s spirit.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C3V9">9 </span>Nicodemus replied,  “How could all this happen?”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C3V10">10 </span>And Jesus answered,  “You’re a Jewish teacher and yet you don’t know all this? <span class="V" id="C3V11">11 </span>It’s true that we just teach what we know, and explain what we’ve seen ourselves, but you people aren’t accepting our testimony. <span class="V" id="C3V12">12 </span>If I tell you all earthly things and you don’t believe them, how will you ever believe if I explain heavenly things? <span class="V" id="C3V13">13 </span>None of you have gone up into heaven, except that I, the Son of Man, have come down from heaven.</p>

<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C3V16">16 </span>“Because in the same way, God loves the people of the world enough to cause his only son to be born and to give him to the world, so that everyone who believes that will not die, but will live forever. <span class="V" id="C3V17">17 </span>God didn’t send his son here to condemn poeple, but rather to save them. <span class="V" id="C3V18">18 </span>The one who trusts in me will not be condemned.

</div><!--rightBox-->
<p class="p">
 <span id="C4"></span><span class="C" id="C4V1">4</span>When Jesus found out that the Pharisees knew that he was gaining and immersing more followers than John had, <span class="V" id="C4V2">2 </span>(although actually it wasn’t Jesus himself that was immersing them, but his disciples were doing it), <span class="V" id="C4V3">3 </span>he left Judea and went back up to Galilee. <span class="V" id="C4V4">4 </span>On the way, he decided to go through Samaria.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V5">5 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Gen 33:19; Josh 24:32.">[ref]</span>Because of that, they came to a town in Samaria called Sukar, which was near the place Joseph had inherited from his father Jacob, <span class="V" id="C4V6">6 </span>and Jacob’s well was there. Jesus was tired from all the walking and was sitting at the well around noon.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V7">7 </span>A woman came from the town to get water from the well, and Jesus asked her for a drink <span class="V" id="C4V8">8 </span>since his followers had gone into the town to buy some lunch.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V9">9 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Ist 4:1-5; Neh 4:1-2.">[ref]</span>The woman said to him, “You’re a Jew. How come you’re asking me for a drink when I’m from Samaria?” (Jews don’t normally associate with anyone from Samaria.)</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V10">10 </span>Jesus answered, “If you had recognised God’s gift and who it is who’s asking you for a drink, you would have asked me and I would have given you <em>living</em> water.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V11">11 </span>But the woman countered, “Sir, you don’t even have <span class="added">rope and</span> a bucket to reach the water in the deep well. How then could you get living water?” <span class="V" id="C4V12">12 </span>I doubt that you’re greater than our ancestor Jacob who made this well for us, and drank this water along with his children and his animals.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V13">13 </span>Jesus responded, “Everyone who drinks this water will get thirsty again, <span class="V" id="C4V14">14 </span>but whoever drinks the water that I give them will find a well springing up inside them—springing into eternal life.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V15">15 </span>The woman said, “Ok. Give me some of that water so that I won’t be thirsty and won’t have to keep coming out here to the well.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V16">16 </span>Jesus said, “First go and get your husband and return here.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V17">17 </span>But she retorted, “I don’t have a husband!”</p>
<p class="p">And Jesus said, “True enough—indeed you don’t.
 <span class="V" id="C4V18">18 </span>You’ve had five husbands and you’re not married to the <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">guy</span> man you’re living with, so that was true.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V19">19 </span>The woman reacted, “Sir, I can tell that you’re a prophet. <span class="V" id="C4V20">20 </span>Our ancestors worshipped on this mountain, but you Jews claim that people should only worship there in Jerusalem.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V21">21 </span>Then Jesus told her, “You need to believe that I’m from God, woman, because a day is coming when everyone will be worshipping him neither on this mountain, nor in Jerusalem. <span class="V" id="C4V22">22 </span>You people in Samaria don’t even know who you worship, but we do because people will be saved by means of the Jews. <span class="V" id="C4V23">23 </span>But a time is coming, starting even now, when the true worshippers will be worshipping the father in spirit and truth, because those are the ones that he is wanting to worship him. <span class="V" id="C4V24">24 </span>God is spirit, and the ones worshipping him must worship in spirit and totally honesty.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V25">25 </span>The woman said, “I’m aware that the Messiah is coming—the chosen one of God. Whenever he appears, he’ll teach us everything.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V26">26 </span>And Jesus responded, “I am the Messiah. Yes, he’s speaking to you!”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V27">27 </span>After this, his followers got back, and they were astounded that he was speaking with a woman. However no one dared ask her, “What are you after?” Or ask him, “Why are you talking with her?”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V28">28 </span>So the woman left her water jar there, and went back into the town. She told the people there, <span class="V" id="C4V29">29 </span>“Come and see a man who knew as much about me as I know myself! He must be the Messiah!” <span class="V" id="C4V30">30 </span>So they left the town and went out to see Jesus.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V31">31 </span>Meanwhile, Jesus’ followers encouraged him, “Teacher, here, eat.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V32">32 </span>But he said, “I’ve had food to eat that you don’t know about.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V33">33 </span>This made his followers ask each other, “Did you see anyone bring him something to eat?”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V34">34 </span>And Jesus explained, “Obeying God who sent me is like food to me, and I plan to finish his work.” <span class="V" id="C4V35">35 </span>Don’t you all have a saying about needing to wait four months for a harvest? But I’m telling you that you all should open your eyes and look at the fields, because they’re already colouring with the coming harvest. <span class="V" id="C4V36">36 </span>The harvester gets paid with a harvest that will last forever so that the ones who plant and the ones who harvest can all celebrate. <span class="V" id="C4V37">37 </span>There’s truth in the statement that one person plants and a different person harvests. <span class="V" id="C4V38">38 </span>I’ve sent you all out to harvest where you haven’t worked before—others did the groundwork and you benefit from their work.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V39">39 </span>And many people of Samaria came out of that town and believed that Jesus is God because the woman had told them that he knew everything she had done. <span class="V" id="C4V40">40 </span>So when they all came, they asked him to stay in their town, and so they stayed there for two days.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V41">41 </span>And many more believed as a result of his teaching, <span class="V" id="C4V42">42 </span>so they told the woman, “We no longer believe just because of what you said, but now that we’ve heard him for ourselves, we can see that he really is the saviour of the world.”</p>

<p class="p">

<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C6V29">29 </span>He answered, “Doing God’s work is putting your trust in the one that He sent here.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C6V30">30 </span>“If so,” they said, “what miracle will you do for us to see so that we can believe in you?

<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C6V34">34 </span>So they requested, “Sir, always give us that bread.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C6V35">35 </span>But Jesus answered, “I am the bread that gives life—whoever comes to me will never hunger, and the one believing in me, will never be thirsty again. <span class="V" id="C6V36">36 </span>But as I said already, although you have seen me you refuse to believe me. <span class="V" id="C6V37">37 </span>Everyone that the Father gives to me will come to me, and I certainly won’t turn away anyone who comes to me, <span class="V" id="C6V38">38 </span>because I came down from heaven, not to do what I want, but to do what the one who sent me wants. <span class="V" id="C6V39">39 </span>And what He wants me to not lose any that he’s given to me, but to bring them back to life on the last day. <span class="V" id="C6V40">40 </span>My father wants everyone who watches me and believes in me to live forever, because I will bring them back to life on that last day.”</p>

<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C6V43">43 </span>Jesus scolded them, “Don’t be grumbling to each other. <span class="V" id="C6V44">44 </span>No one can join me unless the Father who sent me attracts them,and then I’ll be bringing them back to life on the last day.” <span class="V" id="C6V45">45 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Isa 54:13.">[ref]</span>The prophets wrote that the people will be taught by God.

 <span class="V" id="C6V52">52 </span>At this point, the religious leaders began to argue with each other, “How could this man give us his flesh to eat?”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C6V53">53 </span>So Jesus explained, “Indeed if you don’t eat my flesh and drink my blood, you aren’t truly alive! <span class="V" id="C6V54">54 </span>The person who eats my flesh and drinks my blood will gain eternal life—I will bring them back to life on the last day. <span class="V" id="C6V55">55 </span>For my flesh is the true food, and my blood is the true drink. <span class="V" id="C6V56">56 </span>Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood lives in me, and I will live in him. <span class="V" id="C6V57">57 </span>The father is alive and sent me here, and I am alive because of Him, so also the person who eats me will be alive because of me. <span class="V" id="C6V58">58 </span>Unlike your ancestors who ate that bread and then died, whoever eats this bread that came down from heaven will live through to the next age.”</p>
