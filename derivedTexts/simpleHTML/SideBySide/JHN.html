<p id="Disclaimer">Note: This is still a very early look into the unfinished text
    of the <em>Open English Translation</em> of the Bible.
Please double-check the text in advance before using in public.
Some things (like capitalisation of ‘him’ referring to Jesus or ‘father’ referring to God)
    in the <em>RV</em> haven’t been decided yet so we’re still testing both ways.</p>
<p>Note: The <em>Readers’ Version</em> on the left is a translation
into contemporary English aimed at <i>the person on the street</i> who
hasn’t necessarily been brought up with exposure to Biblical jargon and/or 500-year old English.
It’s designed to be used alongside the <em>Literal Version</em> on the right which gives
the English reader a window into what’s actually written in the original languages.
(See the <a href="index.html#Intro">introduction</a> for more details—we
recommend that you read the introduction first if you’re wanting to fully understand the <em>Literal Version</em>.)
By comparing the left and right columns, you should be able to easily get the message of the text,
while at the same time keeping an eye on what it was actually translated from.</p>
<p>Note that <span class="RVadded">greyed words</span> in the <em>RV</em> are words that the translators
consider were most probably in the mind of the writer, but as none of us can double-check
with the original speakers or writers, the reader is free to disagree.
They are clearly marked because we’ve tried to be as honest and transparent as possible.</p>
<p>The <span class="added">lighter coloured words</span> in the <em>LV</em> are words which
aren’t needed in the grammar of the original languages but are required or implied in English.
You can read the <a href="index.html#Key">Key</a> to learn more about them.
The underlines in the <em>LV</em> show when one original language word needs to be translated into two or more English words.
(Just hide them with the button if you don’t need that information and find it distracting.)
Also, the majority of sentences in the <em>LV</em> don’t have the words
put into a sensible English order yet.
(This should be completed by the end of 2023.)</p>
<p>The <span class="nominaSacra">bold words</span>
in the <em>LV New Testament</em> are
<a href="https://BibleQuestions.info/2020/01/25/what-are-nomina-sacra/">words</a>
that the original writers or copyists
marked to indicate that they considered them to refer to God.
<small>(Sadly, this information is not displayed in most Bible translations,
especially since it seems to clearly confirm that the earliest writers/copyists
considered both Jesus and the Holy Spirit to be God.)</small></p>
<p class="mt2">The account of Jesus' ministry by</p>
<p class="mt1">John</p>
<p class="shortPrayer">It is our prayer that the
<em>Open English Translation</em> of the Bible will give you a clear understanding of
the accounts and messages written by the God-inspired Biblical writers.</p>
<div class="bookIntro"><p class="is1">Introduction</p>
<p class="is2">Author</p>
<p class="ip">This account about the works and teachings of Jesus was written by John, brother of James—both of them were in the small group of twelve close followers of Jesus that he selected as His apprentices and who accompanied him around as he taught. Out of them, John was the one that greatly loved Jesus, and his closeness gave him much of the insight that he includes with his description of Jesus’ actions and teaching. The two brothers were the sons of Zebedee, and they had all worked on Lake Galilee as fishermen.</p>
<p class="is2">This account</p>
<p class="ip">We place John’s account before the others because it begins with the eternal existence of Jesus the messiah. Not only is Jesus the godly messenger, he was also the creator who has now descended from heaven as a man. Omitting any mention of the baby Jesus, John does however tell us about John-the-Immerser who came before Jesus to prepare the people for the arrival of the promised messiah.</p>
<p class="ip">In chapters two to twelve it’s written how the various miracles that Jesus did showed that he was the promised messiah to offer life without ending to whoever would accept that he had been sent by God and trust in his teaching. Although there were indeed many who did believe in him, many others were unable to come to that point and ended up opposing Jesus at every turn.</p>
<p class="ip">In chapters thirteen to seventeen, the compassion of Jesus towards his followers is described. He also told them in advance of his impending brutal death.</p>
<p class="ip">In the final few chapters, we read about the arrest and judging of Jesus, his being fastened to a pole and giving up his spirit, his coming back to life, and how his followers saw him and spoke with him again during that period.</p>
<p class="ip">John is careful to explain how to receive life without ending by means of believing that Jesus came down from heaven and obeying his teaching. Jesus himself is the road, the truth, and the life.</p>

<p class="p">

</div><!--rightBox-->
<p class="p">
 <span id="C4"></span><span class="C" id="C4V1">4 </span>When Jesus found out that the Pharisee party knew that he was gaining and immersing more followers than John had, <span class="V" id="C4V2">2 </span>(although actually it wasn’t Jesus himself that was immersing them, but his trainees were doing it), <span class="V" id="C4V3">3 </span>he left Judea and went back up to Galilee. <span class="V" id="C4V4">4 </span>On the way up, he decided to go through Samaria.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V5">5 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Gen 33:19; Josh 24:32.">[ref]</span>Because of that, they came to a town in Samaria called Sukar, which was near the place Joseph had inherited from his father Jacob, <span class="V" id="C4V6">6 </span>and Jacob’s well was there. Jesus was tired from all the walking and was sitting at the well around midday.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V7">7 </span>A woman came from the town to get water from the well, and Jesus asked her for a drink <span class="V" id="C4V8">8 </span>since his followers had gone into the town to buy some lunch.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V9">9 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Ist 4:1-5; Neh 4:1-2.">[ref]</span>The woman said to him, “you’re a Jew. How come you’re asking me for a drink when I’m from Samaria?” (Jews don’t normally associate with anyone from Samaria.)</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V10">10 </span>Jesus answered, “If you had recognised God’s gift and who it is who’s asking you for a drink, you would have asked me and I would have given you <em>living</em> water.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V11">11 </span>But the woman countered, “Sir, you don’t even have <span class="RVadded">rope and</span> a bucket to reach the water in the deep well. How then could you get living water? <span class="V" id="C4V12">12 </span>I doubt that you’re greater than our ancestor Jacob who made this well for us, and drank this water along with his children and his animals.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V13">13 </span>Jesus responded, “Everyone who drinks this water will get thirsty again, <span class="V" id="C4V14">14 </span>but whoever drinks the water that I give them will find a well springing up inside them—springing into eternal life.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V15">15 </span>The woman said, “Ok. Give me some of that water so that I won’t get thirsty and won’t have to keep coming out here to the well.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V16">16 </span>Jesus said, “First, go and get your husband and return here.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V17">17 </span>But she retorted, “I don’t have a husband!”</p>
<p class="p">And Jesus said, “True enough—indeed you don’t.
 <span class="V" id="C4V18">18 </span>You’ve had five husbands and you’re not married to the man you’re living with, so that was true.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V19">19 </span>The woman reacted, “Sir, I can see that you’re a prophet. <span class="V" id="C4V20">20 </span>Our ancestors worshipped on this mountain, but you Jews claim that people should only worship there in Jerusalem.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V21">21 </span>Then Jesus told her, “You need to believe that I was sent from God, woman, because a day is coming when everyone will be worshipping him neither on this mountain, nor in Jerusalem. <span class="V" id="C4V22">22 </span>You people in Samaria don’t even know who you worship, but we do, because people will be saved by means of us Jews. <span class="V" id="C4V23">23 </span>But a time is coming, starting even now, when the true worshippers will be worshipping the father in spirit and truth, because those are the ones that he is wanting to worship him. <span class="V" id="C4V24">24 </span>God is spirit, and the ones worshipping him must worship in spirit and total honesty.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V25">25 </span>The woman said, “I’m aware that the messiah is coming—the chosen one of God. Whenever he appears, he’ll teach us everything.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V26">26 </span>And Jesus responded, “I am the messiah. Yes, he’s speaking to you!”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V27">27 </span>After this, his followers arrived back, and they were astounded that he was speaking with a woman. However no one dared ask her, “What are you after?” Or to ask him, “Why are you talking with her?”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V28">28 </span>So the woman left her water jar there, and went back into the town where she told the people, <span class="V" id="C4V29">29 </span>“Come and see a man who knew as much about me as I know myself! He must be the messiah!” <span class="V" id="C4V30">30 </span>So they went out from the town to go and see Jesus.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V31">31 </span>Meanwhile, Jesus’ followers encouraged him, “Teacher, here, eat.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V32">32 </span>But he said, “I’ve had food to eat that you don’t know about.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V33">33 </span>This made his followers ask each other, “Did you see anyone bring him something to eat?”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V34">34 </span>And Jesus explained, “Obeying God who sent me is like food to me, and I plan to finish his work. <span class="V" id="C4V35">35 </span>Don’t you all have a saying about needing to wait four months for a harvest? But I’m telling you that you all should open your eyes and look at the fields, because they’re already colouring with the coming harvest. <span class="V" id="C4V36">36 </span>The harvester gets paid with a harvest that will last forever so that the ones who plant and the ones who harvest can all celebrate. <span class="V" id="C4V37">37 </span>There’s truth in the statement that one person plants and a different person harvests. <span class="V" id="C4V38">38 </span>I’ve sent you all out to harvest where you haven’t worked before—others did the groundwork and you benefit from their work.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V39">39 </span>And many people of Samaria came out of that town and believed that Jesus is God because the woman had told them that he knew everything about her. <span class="V" id="C4V40">40 </span>So when they all came, they asked him to stay in their town, and so they stayed on there for a couple of days.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V41">41 </span>And many more believed as a result of his teaching, <span class="V" id="C4V42">42 </span>so they told the woman, “We no longer believe just because of what you said, but now that we’ve heard him for ourselves, we can see that he really is the saviour of the world.”</p>

 <span class="V" id="C6V25">25 </span>When they found him there across the lake, they queried, “Teacher, when did you come here?”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C6V26">26 </span>And Jesus answered, “Honestly, I know that you’re looking for me, not because you saw miracles, but because you all had plenty of food to fill you up. <span class="V" id="C6V27">27 </span>Don’t <span class="RVadded">just</span> work for the food which goes off, but for the food which lasts forever, which mankind’s child will give to you because God the Father has put his mark of approval on Acts”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C6V28">28 </span>Puzzled, they asked him, “What should we be doing if we want to do God’s work?”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C6V29">29 </span>He answered, “Doing God’s work is putting your trust in the one that He sent here.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C6V30">30 </span>“If so,” they said, “what miracle will you do for us to see so that we can believe in you? What can you do? <span class="V" id="C6V31">31 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Exo 16:4,15; Psa 78:24.">[ref]</span>Our ancestors ate the manna out in the wilderness, as Moses wrote, ‘He gave them bread from heaven to eat.’ ”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C6V32">32 </span>Jesus said to them, “Actually I can tell you that it wasn’t Moses who gave them bread from heaven, but my father gives you the real bread from heaven, <span class="V" id="C6V33">33 </span>because the bread of God is the one who came down from heaven and who gives life to the world.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C6V34">34 </span>So they requested, “Mister, always give us that bread.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C6V35">35 </span>But Jesus answered, “<em>I am</em> the bread that gives life—whoever comes to me will never hunger, and the one believing in me, will never be thirsty again. <span class="V" id="C6V36">36 </span>But as I said already, although you have seen me you refuse to believe me. <span class="V" id="C6V37">37 </span>Everyone that the Father gives to me will come to me, and I certainly won’t turn away anyone who comes to me, <span class="V" id="C6V38">38 </span>because I came down from heaven, not to do what I want, but to do what the one who sent me wants. <span class="V" id="C6V39">39 </span>And what He wants is for me to not lose any that he’s given to me, but to bring them back to life on the last day. <span class="V" id="C6V40">40 </span>My father wants everyone who watches me and believes in me to live forever, because I will bring them back to life on that last day.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C6V41">41 </span>This little speech made the religious leaders grumble about him because he had said that he was the food that came down from heaven, <span class="V" id="C6V42">42 </span>as they figured out, “This is Jesus the son of Joseph and so we know his parents. So how can he say that he come down from heaven?”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C6V43">43 </span>Jesus scolded them, “Don’t be grumbling to each other. <span class="V" id="C6V44">44 </span>No one can join me unless the Father who sent me attracts them, and then I’ll be bringing them back to life on the last day.” <span class="V" id="C6V45">45 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Isa 54:13.">[ref]</span>The prophets wrote that the people will be taught by God.

<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C6V52">52 </span>At this point, the religious leaders began to argue with each other, “How could this man give us his flesh to eat?”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C6V53">53 </span>So Jesus explained, “Indeed if you don’t eat my flesh and drink my blood, you aren’t truly alive! <span class="V" id="C6V54">54 </span>The person who eats my flesh and drinks my blood will gain eternal life—I will bring them back to life on the last day. <span class="V" id="C6V55">55 </span>For my flesh is the true food, and my blood is the true drink. <span class="V" id="C6V56">56 </span>Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood lives in me, and I will live in him. <span class="V" id="C6V57">57 </span>The father is alive and sent me here, and I am alive because of Him, so also the person who eats me will be alive because of me. <span class="V" id="C6V58">58 </span>Unlike your ancestors who ate that bread and then died, whoever eats this bread that came down from heaven will live through to the next age.”</p>

 <span id="C21"></span><span class="C" id="C21V1">21 </span>After all this, Jesus revealed himself again to his trainees at Lake Galilee. It happened like this: <span class="V" id="C21V2">2 </span>Simon Peter, Thomas nicknamed ‘Twin’, Nathanael from Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two other trainees had gathered together <span class="V" id="C21V3">3 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Luk 5:5.">[ref]</span>when Simon Petter said that he was going fishing and the others said that they’d join him.</p>
<p class="p">So they went off and boarded the boat, but they didn’t catch anything that night.
</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C21V4">4 </span>When the dawn was approaching, Jesus was standing there on the shore, but they didn’t know that it was him. <span class="V" id="C21V5">5 </span>Jesus called out, “Hey, young fellas. Don’t you have any fish?”</p>
<p class="p">“None.” they answered.
</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C21V6">6 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Luk 5:6.">[ref]</span>So he said, “Throw the net out over the right side of the boat and you’ll find some.” So they did it and they caught so many fish that the net was too heavy to pull back in.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C21V7">7 </span>Now the intern that Jesus loved said to Peter, “It’s the master!” When Simon Peter heard that, he put on his robe (because he didn’t have it on), and jumped overboard into the lake. <span class="V" id="C21V8">8 </span>The other trainees followed in the little boat dragging the net behind them because they were only about 100m out from the shore. <span class="V" id="C21V9">9 </span>When they went up the beach, they saw some bread there and a charcoal fire with fish cooking on it <span class="V" id="C21V10">10 </span>and Jesus told them, “Bring some of the fish that you just caught.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C21V11">11 </span>So Simon Peter went and dragged the net onto the beach. Amazingly it hadn’t torn even though it contained 153 large fish. <span class="V" id="C21V12">12 </span>Then Jesus said, “Now, come and have breakfast.” But none of the trainees dared to ask who he was, because they figured it must be the master. <span class="V" id="C21V13">13 </span>Jesus brought the bread to them and shared it around, and then likewise for the fish.</p>
