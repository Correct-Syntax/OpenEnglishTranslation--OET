<h1>Open English Translation (OET) Development</h1>
<h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>

<h3 id="sectionHeadings">Why are section headings in boxes in the <em>Readers’ Version</em>?</h3>
<p>As explained in the <a href="index.html#sectionHeadings">Introduction</a>,
 many other English Bible translations break the text and put section headings right across the column.
This can tend to encourage the reader to read the text in unnatural chunks
 that were never divided by the author.
The <em>OET</em> on the other hand wants to educate readers that the narratives
 and prophecies and letters, etc., were written as contiguous documents.
Hence our section headings are designed not to break the text any more than necessary.</p>

<h3 id="paraphrase">Is the <em>Readers’ Version</em> a paraphrase?</h3>
<p>Well, it’s close, in fact you could debate all day about
 what is a modern, fluent translation and what is a paraphrase.
The short answer is that we don’t regard the <em>OET-RV</em> as a paraphrase,
 but rather as a modern English translation.
Our goal with the <em>OET-RV</em> is to take both the words and cultural background
 of the original authors, and express the meaning in the modern language of our generation.
We’ve tried to avoid <i>Bible jargon</i> (words that you’d only hear in church),
 and to think carefully about how we might explain it on the street.
So we’ve done the hard work for you to make the Bible accessible
 and understandable to the average person.
And always remember that the <em>OET</em> provides a <em>Literal Version</em>
 that’s intended be referred to alongside the <em>Readers’ Version</em>
 if you’d really like a word-for-word rendering of the Hebrew or Greek.
(Having both side-by-side does mean that we were able to break away from ancient/traditional Bible wording
 and think carefully about how we say things these days.)</p>

<h3 id="informal">Why does the <em>Readers’ Version</em> seem so informal?</h3>
<p>Oh, that probably means that you’re already accustomed to more traditional Bible translations
 that sometimes propogate decisions made in the 1500s by William Tyndale,
 or even back in the 1300s by John Wycliffe.
Now those early English translators did many things very well,
 and we’re not here to criticise more modern English translations either,
 but nevertheless it’s a sad fact that established traditions
 can make it hard for anyone to make improvements.
For example, most Christians don’t even blink at the title often printed on Bible covers: “God’s Word”.
 That’s because in Christian circles, ‘word’ often means ‘statement’, ‘account’, or ‘message’.
 Only someone on the street might wonder which ‘word’ it means.
 (Generally these days, a ‘word’ is something on a page like this one.)
It’s because we’ve become so accustomed to this unusual or quaint (or archaic?) use of language
 that a Bible that actually uses natural English sounds so ‘informal’ to many readers.</p>

<h3 id="bias">Is the <em>Open English Translation</em> theologically biased?</h3>
<p>Ha, we don’t think so, but if you find any slip-ups,
 please do contact us.
Certainly we will have lost some readers by replacing ‘baptism’ (transliterated from the Greek word)
 with ‘immersion’, but that’s primarily a translation decision
 to use the regular meaning of the word rather than to put Greek into our English.
We certainly don’t have any intentional theological agenda in creating the <em>OET</em>
 other than trying to use as little as possible of the language and terms
 that you would only hear in church circles
 and which don’t correspond with how other people would normally talk in the 2020s.<br>
In other words, the <em>OET</em> is aimed at sharing the Good News
 with non-churched people without having to speak ‘Church English’ (or <i>jargon</i>) to them.
A side-effect is to express the message of the Biblical texts with fresh phrasing
 that’s different from many traditional English translations
 and thus encourage (or maybe even, <i>shock</i>) regular Bible readers
 into seriously thinking about what the original writers were trying to communicate.</p>

<h3 id="bold">What are the bolded words in the <em>Literal Version</em>?</h3>
<p>As explained in the <a href="index.html#Key">Key</a>, the bold text
 indicates the use of <em>Nomina Sacra</em> on the original manuscripts.
These are special markings and abbreviations done by the scribes,
 and in the earliest manuscripts, highlight words that are assumed to relate to God.</p>

<h3 id="uphill">Why does the <em>Literal Version</em> have uphill and downhill everywhere?</h3>
<p>In our culture, when we go <i>up</i> somewhere, it usually means to go north.
(Other cultures typically use ‘up’ and ‘down’ for ‘uphill’ and ‘downhill’,
 or ‘upstream’ and ‘downstream’, etc., depending on the common modes of travel.)
The <em>LV</em> overtranslates <i>uphill</i> and <i>downhill</i>
 in order to help our readers avoid misunderstanding the cultural cues.</p>
<p>And just a bonus tip: Most modern maps of our countries or of the world
 have north at the top.
However, most maps from Biblical times had the east at the top!
(This actually makes quite a bit of sense as we’re all rapidly hurtling
 towards the east as our planet spins us.)</p>

<h3 id="baptise">Why is the word <i>baptise</i> missing from the <em>OET</em>?</h3>
<p>Ha, the short answer is that <i>baptise</i> is a Greek word
 and the “ET” in <em>OET</em> stands for <b>English Translation</b>
 (so we try to use English words, not Greek ones).</p>
<p>The long answer is that the word <i>baptise</i> is not a translation
 of the Greek word βαπτίζω (baptizo), but just a transliteration.
In other words, it was an invented English word that Bible readers have gotten used to in their jargon,
 but which isn’t used outside of religious contexts.
However, the Koine Greek word means “to dip, dunk, immerse, or sink”
 (but certainly doesn’t mean “to sprinkle”).
So the <em>Open English Translation</em> is one of the
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/parallel/matthew/3-11.htm">very few</a>
 to actually translate the word.</p>

<h3 id="chapterCount">How many chapters are there in the Bible?</h3>
<p>Well, it depends on which Bible you’re asking about,
 but the <em>OET</em> has <b>929</b> chapters in the “Old Testament” and
 <b>260</b> in the “New Testament”, so a total of <b>1,189</b> chapters.</p>
<p>And if you’re wondering, the <em>OET</em> has over <b>23,000</b> verses in the “Old Testament” and
 very close to <b>8,000</b> in the “New Testament”, so a total of over <b>31,000</b> verses.
<small>(It’s hard to count exact numbers of verses in a modern Bible translation,
 because some verse numbers are still there but don’t match any text in the older original texts,
 so don’t actually have any content in the translation.)</small></p>
<p><a href="index.html#chaptersAndVerses">Note</a> that the <em>OET</em>
 tries to downplay the use of chapters and verses
 as chapters are artificial and sometimes quite unnatural breaks in the flow of the text,
 and verse breaks are sometimes even worse—often plonked right in the middle of a sentence.</p>

<h3 id="similar">Which other translations are the closest to the <em>OET</em>?</h3>
<p>Any English Bible translation which contains <i>Literal</i> in its name
 is probably close to the <em>OET-LV</em>.
However, the <em>OET-LV</em> is probably more literal in a sense
 because most other <i>Literal</i> translations are designed to be easy to read.
 whereas the <em>OET-LV</em> is mostly designed as a reference tool for readers of the <em>OET-RV</em>.</p>
<p>The <i>Contemporary English Version (CEV)</i> and then the <i>New Living Translation (NLT)</i>
 are probably the closest to the <em>OET-RV</em>.
 But the <em>OET-LV</em> goes out of its way to remove church jargon more than
 most other contemporary English Bible translations.</p>

<h3 id="uW">Are the <em>OET-LV</em> and <em>OET-RV</em> replicating what uW is doing with the <em>ULT</em> and <em>UST</em>?</h3>
<p>No, not at all.</p>
<ol><li class="intro">The <a href="https://door43.org/u/unfoldingWord/en_ult/">unfoldingWord Literal Text</a>
 is not as literal as the <em>OET Literal Version</em>.
 The <em>ULT</em> is designed to be translated by those who don’t have English as their first language,
 whereas the <em>OET-LV</em> is quite a technical translation aimed at well-educated, native English speakers.</li>
<li class="intro">The <a href="https://door43.org/u/unfoldingWord/en_ust/">unfoldingWord Simplified Text</a>
 is again designed for Bible translators don’t have English as their first language.
 The <em>UST</em> is a specialist translation tool that removes all figures of speech and passive constructions
 in order to help Bible translators access the meaning to translate into their languages.
 On the contrary, the <em>OET Readers’ Version</em> is aimed at the average 2020’s English speaker on the street
 (and certainly contains passive constructions and figures of speech).</li>

<h3 id="Feedback">Feedback</h3>
<p>These web pages are a very preliminary preview into a work still in progress.
 The <em>OET</em> is not yet finished, and not yet publicly released,
 but we need to have it available online for easy access for our checkers and reviewers.
