<h1>Open English Translation (OET) Development</h1>
<h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>

<h3 id="sectionHeadings">Why are section headings in boxes in the <em>Readers’ Version</em>?</h3>
<p>As explained in the <a href="index.html#sectionHeadings">Introduction</a>,
 many other English Bible translations break the text and put section headings right across the column.
This can tend to encourage the reader to read the text in unnatural chunks
 that were never divided by the author.
The <em>OET</em> on the other hand wants to educate readers that the narratives
 and prophecies and letters, etc., were written as contiguous documents.
Hence our section headings are designed not to break the text any more than necessary.</p>

<h3 id="paraphrase">Is the <em>Readers’ Version</em> a paraphrase?</h3>
<p>Well, it’s close, in fact you could debate all day about
 what is a modern, fluent translation and what is a paraphrase.
The short answer is that we don’t regard the <em>OET-RV</em> as a paraphrase,
 but rather as a modern English translation.
Our goal with the <em>OET-RV</em> is to take both the words and cultural background
 of the original authors, and express the meaning in the modern language of our generation.
We’ve tried to avoid <i>Bible jargon</i> (words that you’d only hear in church),
 and to think carefully about how we might explain it on the street.
So we’ve done the hard work for you to make the Bible accessible
 and understandable to the average person.
And always remember that the <em>OET</em> provides a <em>Literal Version</em>
 that is intended be referred to alongside the <em>Readers’ Version</em>
 if you’d really like a word-for-word rendering of the Hebrew or Greek.
(This does mean that we were able to break away from ancient/traditional Bible wording
 and think carefully about how we say things these days.)</p>

<h3 id="bold">What are the bolded words in the <em>Literal Version</em>?</h3>
<p>As explained in the <a href="index.html#Key">Key</a>, the bold text
 indicates the use of <em>Nomina Sacra</em> on the original manuscripts.
These are special markings and abbreviations done by the scribes,
 and in the earliest manuscripts, highlight words that are assumed to relate to God.</p>

<h3 id="baptise">Why is the word <i>baptise</i> missing from the <em>OET</em>?</h3>
<p>Ha, the short answer is that <i>baptise</i> is a Greek word
 and the “ET” in <em>OET</em> stands for <b>English Translation</b>
 (so we try to use English words, not Greek ones).</p>
<p>The long answer is that the word <i>baptise</i> is not a translation
 of the Greek word βαπτίζω (baptizo), but just a transliteration.
In other words, it was an invented English word that Bible readers have gotten used to in their jargon,
 but which isn’t used outside of religious contexts.
However, the Koine Greek word means “to dip, dunk, immerse, or sink”
 (but certainly doesn’t mean “to sprinkle”).
So the <em>Open English Translation</em> is one of the
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/parallel/matthew/3-11.htm">very few</a>
 to translate it correctly.</p>

<h3 id="chapterCount">How many chapters are there in the Bible?</h3>
<p>Well, it depends on which Bible you’re asking about,
 but the <em>OET</em> has <b>929</b> chapters in the “Old Testament” and
 <b>260</b> in the “New Testament”, so a total of <b>1,189</b> chapters.</p>
<p>And if you’re wondering, the <em>OET</em> has over <b>23,000</b> verses in the “Old Testament” and
 very close to <b>8,000</b> in the “New Testament”, so a total of over <b>31,000</b> verses.
<small>(It’s hard to count exact numbers of verses in a modern Bible translation,
 because some verse numbers are still there but don’t match any text in the older original texts,
 so don’t actually have any content in the translation.)</small></p>
<p><a href="index.html#chaptersAndVerses">Note</a> that the <em>OET</em>
 tries to downplay the use of chapters and verses
 as chapters are artificial and sometimes quite unnatural breaks in the flow of the text,
 and verse breaks are sometimes even worse—often plonked right in the middle of a sentence.</p>

<h3 id="similar">Which other translations are the closest to the <em>OET</em>?</h3>
<p>Any English Bible translation which contains <i>Literal</i> in its name
 is probably close to the <em>OET-LV</em>.
However, the <em>OET-LV</em> is probably more literal in a sense
 because most other <i>Literal</i> translations are designed to be easy to read.
 whereas the <em>OET-LV</em> is mostly designed as a reference tool for readers of the <em>OET-RV</em>.</p>
<p>The <i>Contemporary English Version (CEV)</i> and then the <i>New Living Translation (NLT)</i>
 are probably the closest to the <em>OET-RV</em>.
 But the <em>OET-LV</em> goes out of its way to remove church jargon more than
 most other contemporary English Bible translations.</p>

<h3 id="uW">Are the <em>OET-LV</em> and <em>OET-RV</em> replicating what uW is doing with the <em>ULT</em> and <em>UST</em>?</h3>
<p>No, not at all.</p>
<ol><li class="intro">The <a href="https://door43.org/u/unfoldingWord/en_ult/">unfoldingWord Literal Text</a>
 is not as literal as the <em>OET Literal Version</em>.
 The <em>ULT</em> is designed to be translated by those who don’t have English as their first language,
 whereas the <em>OET-LV</em> is quite a technical translation aimed at well-educated, native English speakers.</li>
<li class="intro">The <a href="https://door43.org/u/unfoldingWord/en_ust/">unfoldingWord Simplified Text</a>
 is again designed for Bible translators don’t have English as their first language.
 The <em>UST</em> is a specialist translation tool that removes all figures of speech and passive constructions
 in order to help Bible translators access the meaning to translate into their languages.
 On the contrary, the <em>OET Readers’ Version</em> is aimed at the average 2020’s English speaker on the street
 (and certainly contains passive constructions and figures of speech).</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="Feedback">Feedback</h3>
<p>These web pages are a very preliminary preview into a work still in progress.
 The <em>OET</em> is not yet finished, and not yet publicly released,
 but we need to have it available online for easy access for our checkers and reviewers.
