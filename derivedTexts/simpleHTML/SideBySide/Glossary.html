<h1>Open English Translation (OET) Development</h1>
<h2>Glossary</h2>
<p>This page contains words which need further explanations.</p>

<h3 id="apostle">ambassador, apostle, missionary</h3>
<p><i>Missionary</i> (literally <i>sent-out one</i> would be the natural translation
 of the Greek word (<a href="https://biblehub.com/greek/652.htm">ἀπόστολος</a>),
 but that’s not always what it’s used for in the “New Testament”.
Sometimes it’s used as a synonym for the close disciples when they were sent out
 (e.g., see <a href="MRK.html#C6V30">Mark 6:30</a>).
Other times it seems to be used for church authorities,
 and it’s often used for that today,
 although not generally used at all outside of church language.</p>

<h3 id="disciple">apprentice, disciple, follower</h3>
<p>While it is true that the word <i>disciple</i>
 (<a href="https://biblehub.com/greek/3101.htm">μαθητής</a>)
 can probably be understood by most modern readers,
 it’s the concept more than the word that people aren’t really familiar with these days.
Some do indeed go to the East and place themselves under the teaching of various <i>guru</i>s,
 but we wouldn’t usually use the term <i>disciple</i> for an intern in the church.
The term is complicated when it’s used in the Bible for thousands of Jesus followers,
 and then used for the selected twelve close followers, and sometimes for other size groups in-between.
So the <em>Readers’ Version</em> has elected to use <i>followers</i> most of the time,
 and the word <i>apprentices</i> for the twelve who stuck more closely with Jesus.
At least modern readers understand the work of an apprentice who works for the master tradesman
 who takes responsibility for their work,
 even if much of the actual teaching is done away at a block course in an institution these days.</p>

<h3 id="name">name</h3>
<p>In ancient days, if a group of horse riders turned up at your house and said,
 “We’ve come to arrest you in the name of King Henry!”,
 they meant that they have come with the <i>authority</i> of the king.
So too, sometimes when we read about <i>the name of Jesus</i>,
 it might not only be referring to his actual name,
 but also referring to his <i>authority</i>,
 for example his authority over demons.
Thus when praying for healing, it’s not necessarily productive to shout “in the name of Jesus” over and over
 (not least because that’s not really anything like his actual name).
What if the traffic officer shouted, “Prime-minister, prime-minister” over and over again
 in order to convince you that he has authority from the government to issue you a ticket?
Perhaps it might be more helpful to consider how you would pray if you worked for Jesus
 and believed that he has given you his authority to command these things.</p>
<p>P.S. Look in the <em>Literal Version</em> to see how to properly pronounce the names of Biblical characters.</p>

<h3 id="priest">priest</h3>
<p>It’s important that you don’t picture a Roman Catholic or an Anglican or an Orthodox priest
 as you read the Bible.
 Remember that most of the priests mentioned in the Bible are Jewish priests,
 and had their own unique set of traditions.</p>

<h3 id="word">word</h3>
<p>John’s gospel account typically <a href="https://biblehub.com/parallel/john/1-1.htm">starts with</a>
 “In the beginning was the Word…” but which word was it? “Tree?” “Apple?” “Snake?”
Of course it’s not talking about the normal meaning of the word <i>word</i>,
 but a religious use of the word as it later refers to Jesus the Messiah.
But Jesus isn’t a word like the words on this page, but it refers to something totally different.
In fact, the meaning of Greek
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/greek/3056.htm">λόγος</a> (‘logos’—but not the plural of logo),
 more likely refers to a speech, message, statement, or account
 and very rarely refers to a single word.
In other words, it would be extremely rare for modern speaker to use the word <i>word</i>
 to describe a message: 
 “The president read out a long word at the stadium opening ceremony.” Never!
So the <em>OET</em> breaks tradition and
 tries to give a <b>modern</b> translation of what the Bible writers wrote.</p>

<h3 id="Feedback">Feedback</h3>
<p>These web pages are a very preliminary preview into a work still in progress.
 The <em>OET</em> is not yet finished, and not yet publicly released,
 but we need to have it available online for easy access for our checkers and reviewers.
