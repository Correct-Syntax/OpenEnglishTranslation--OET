<p id="Disclaimer">Note: This is still a very early look into the unfinished text
    of the <em>Open English Translation</em> of the Bible.
Please double-check the text in advance before using in public.
Some things (like capitalisation of ‘him’ referring to Jesus or ‘father’ referring to God)
    in the <em>RV</em> haven’t been decided yet so we’re still testing both ways.</p>
<p>Note: The <em>Readers’ Version</em> on the left is a translation
into contemporary English aimed at <i>the person on the street</i> who
hasn’t necessarily been brought up with exposure to Biblical jargon and/or 500-year old English.
It’s designed to be used alongside the <em>Literal Version</em> on the right which gives
the English reader a window into what’s actually written in the original languages.
(See the <a href="index.html#Intro">introduction</a> for more details—we
recommend that you read the introduction first if you’re wanting to fully understand the <em>Literal Version</em>.)
By comparing the left and right columns, you should be able to easily get the message of the text,
while at the same time keeping an eye on what it was actually translated from.</p>
<p>Note that <span class="RVadded">greyed words</span> in the <em>RV</em> are words that the translators
consider were most probably in the mind of the writer, but as none of us can double-check
with the original speakers or writers, the reader is free to disagree.
They are clearly marked because we’ve tried to be as honest and transparent as possible.</p>
<p>The <span class="added">lighter coloured words</span> in the <em>LV</em> are words which
aren’t needed in the grammar of the original languages but are required or implied in English.
You can read the <a href="index.html#Key">Key</a> to learn more about them.
The underlines in the <em>LV</em> show when one original language word needs to be translated into two or more English words.
(Just hide them with the button if you don’t need that information and find it distracting.)
Also, the majority of sentences in the <em>LV</em> don’t have the words
put into a sensible English order yet.
(This should be completed by the end of 2023.)</p>
<p>The <span class="nominaSacra">bold words</span>
in the <em>LV New Testament</em> are
<a href="https://BibleQuestions.info/2020/01/25/what-are-nomina-sacra/">words</a>
that the original writers or copyists
marked to indicate that they considered them to refer to God.
<small>(Sadly, this information is not displayed in most Bible translations,
especially since it seems to clearly confirm that the earliest writers/copyists
considered both Jesus and the Holy Spirit to be God.)</small></p>
<p class="mt2">The account of Jesus' ministry by</p>

<div class="bookIntro"><p class="is1">Introduction</p>
<p class="is2">Author</p>
<p class="ip">This account about the works and teachings of Jesus was written by Mark, the son of a Jewish family who lived in Jerusalem. His mother was named Mary (<a href="ACT.html#C12V12">Acts 12:12</a>).</p>
<p class="ip">Many people think he was John Mark, a cousin of Barnabas (<a href="COL.html#C4V10">Col. 4:10</a>) who accompanied Paul on his first long-distance trip to spread the good news about Jesus the messiah (<a href="ACT.html#C12V25">Acts 12:25</a>, <a href="ACT.html#C13V13">13:13</a>). We also know that Mark accompanied Peter (<a href="PE1.html#C5V13">1 Peter 5:13</a>), and some consider that it might have been Peter who narrated to Mark what Jesus had done and taught.</p>
<p class="is2">This account</p>
<p class="ip">This account seems to have been written for non-Jews, especially perhaps those familiar with Roman customs. So he didn’t use as much ink as Matthew or Luke explaining prophecies from the Jewish scriptures but he does, however, take time to explain Jewish customs to help non-Jewish readers.</p>
<p class="ip">Mark explains here that Jesus came to serve both God and the people, and he often refers to him as ‘mankind’s child’ (traditionally translated very literally from the Greek as the ‘Son of Man’). We can see that especially in <a href="#C10V45">10:45</a>: “Even mankind’s child didn’t come to be served, but to serve others and to give his life as a ransom to set many people free.” Mark wants his readers to know that Jesus did incredible things, but especially focuses on his teaching. He confirms the power and authority of Jesus by telling about the miracles that he did, his healing of the sick, and his exorcism of demons.</p>
<p class="ip">The ending of this narrative is often disputed, and scholars are still <a href="https://textandcanon.org/a-case-for-the-longer-ending-of-mark">debating</a> about whether or not the longer ending (<a href="#C16V9">16:9-20</a>) is original. The <em>OET</em> includes the disputed longer ending, but displays it in a lighter colour to indicate its debatable status.</p>

<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C5V21">21 </span>When Jesus had crossed in the boat to the other side of the lake, a large crowd of people came out to the lake edge to see him. <span class="V" id="C5V22">22 </span>A religious leader named Jairus came out, and when he found Jesus he fell down at his feet <span class="V" id="C5V23">23 </span>and pleaded, “My young daughter is critical and just hanging on for you to come and touch her so that she can be healed and live.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C5V24">24 </span>So Jesus went off with Jairus. The large crowd followed also and many were getting pressed against Jesus.</p>

<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C5V29">29 </span>And immediately the bleeding stopped and she knew that she had been healed. <span class="V" id="C5V30">30 </span>Immediately also, Jesus knew that power had gone out of him, and he turned back towards the crowd and said, “Who touched my clothes?”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C5V31">31 </span>But his followers said, “You can see all the people that were pressing on you so why would you ask who touched you?”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C5V32">32 </span>But Jesus was still looking around to see who had done it. <span class="V" id="C5V33">33 </span>And the woman, scared and shaking because of what was happening, came and fell down in front of Jesus and told him the whole story. <span class="V" id="C5V34">34 </span>Jesus said, “Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace and full health.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C5V35">35 </span>While he was still speaking, messengers came from Jairus’ house to tell him, “Your daughter has died. Why bother the teacher any more?”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C5V36">36 </span>But Jesus overheard them telling this to the leader and told him, “Don’t be afraid—keep believing.” <span class="V" id="C5V37">37 </span>And Jesus didn’t allow anyone to accompany him other than Peter, and James and his brother, John. <span class="V" id="C5V38">38 </span>As they approached Jairus’ house, Jesus saw a big commotion with lots of crying and yelling going on. <span class="V" id="C5V39">39 </span>As he entered, he said, “Why are you all crying in distress? The child hasn’t died—she’s just sleeping!”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C5V40">40 </span>But they just ridiculed Jesus. So he sent them all outside, just taking the father and mother of the child, along with three with him. He went in where the girl was <span class="V" id="C5V41">41 </span>and taking her hand, he said, “Young woman, I tell you: get up!” <span class="V" id="C5V42">42 </span>Immediately she got up and walked around. And everyone marvelled at the amazing thing that had happened. (She was twelve years old.) <span class="V" id="C5V43">43 </span>Jesus repeatedly told them to keep this to themselves, and added that they should give her something to eat.</p>
