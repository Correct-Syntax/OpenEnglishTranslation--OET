<p>Note: This is still a very early look into the unfinished text
    of the <em>Open English Translation</em> of the Bible.
Please double-check the text before using in public.
Some things (like capitalisation of “him” referring to Jesus or “father” referring to God)
    in the <em>RV</em> haven’t been decided yet so we’re still testing both ways.</p>
<p>Note: The <em>Readers’ Version</em> on the left is a translation
into contemporary English aimed at <i>the person on the street</i> who
hasn’t necessarily been brought up with exposure to Biblical jargon and/or King James English.
It’s designed to be used alongside the <em>Literal Version</em> on the right which gives
the English reader a window into what’s actually written in the original languages.
(See the <a href="index.html#Intro">introduction</a> for more details—we
recommend that you read the introduction first if you’re wanting to fully understand the <em>Literal Version</em>.)
By comparing the left and right columns, you should be able to easily get the message of the text,
while at the same time keeping an eye on what it was actually translated from.</p>
<p class="mt1">Mark</p>
<p class="shortPrayer">It is our prayer that the
<em>Open English Translation</em> of the Bible will give you clear understanding of
the messages written by the inspired Biblical writers.</p>

<div class="bookIntro"><p class="is1">Introduction</p>
<p class="is2">Author</p>
<p class="ip">This account about the works and teachings of Jesus was written by Mark, the son of a Jewish family who lived in Jerusalem. His mother was named Mary (<a href="ACT.html#C12V12">Acts 12:12</a>).</p>
<p class="ip">Many people think he was John Mark, a cousin of Barnabas (<a href="COL.html#C4V10">Col. 4:10</a>) who accompanied Paul on his first long-distance trip to spread the good news about Jesus the Messiah (<a href="ACT.html#C12V25">Acts 12:25</a>, <a href="ACT.html#C13V13">13:13</a>). We also know that Mark accompanied Peter (<a href="PE1.html#C5V13">1 Peter 5:13</a>), and some consider that it might have been Peter who narrated to Mark what Jesus had done and taught.</p>
<p class="is2">This account</p>
<p class="ip">This account seems to have been written for non-Jews, especially perhaps those familiar with Roman customs. So he didn’t use much ink as Matthew or Luke explaining prophecies from the Jewish scriptures but he does, however, take time to explain Jewish customs to help non-Jewish readers.</p>
<p class="ip">Mark explains here that Jesus came to serve both God and the people, and he often refers to him as the “Son of Man”. We can see that especially in <a href="#C10V45">10:45</a>: “...” Mark wants his readers to know that Jesus did incredible things, but especially focuses on his teaching. He confirms the power and authority of Jesus by telling about the miracles that he did, his healing of the sick, and his exorcism of demons.</p>
<p class="ip">The ending of this narrative is often disputed, and scholars are still debating about whether or not the longer ending (<a href="#C16V9">16:9-20</a>) is original. The <em>OET</em> includes the disputed longer ending, but displays it in a smaller font to indicate its debatable status.</p>
<p class="iot">Main components of Mark’s account</p>
<p class="io1">Preparation for and arrival of the Messiah <a href="#C1V1">1:1-13</a></p>
