<p id="Disclaimer">Note: This is still a very early look into the unfinished text
    of the <em>Open English Translation</em> of the Bible.
Please double-check the text in advance before using in public.
Some things (like capitalisation of ‘him’ referring to Jesus or ‘father’ referring to God)
    in the <em>RV</em> haven’t been decided yet so we’re still testing both ways.</p>
<p>Note: The <em>Readers’ Version</em> on the left is a translation
into contemporary English aimed at <i>the person on the street</i> who
hasn’t necessarily been brought up with exposure to Biblical jargon and/or 500-year old English.
It’s designed to be used alongside the <em>Literal Version</em> on the right which gives
the English reader a window into what’s actually written in the original languages.
(See the <a href="index.html#Intro">introduction</a> for more details—we
recommend that you read the introduction first if you’re wanting to fully understand the <em>Literal Version</em>.)
By comparing the left and right columns, you should be able to easily get the message of the text,
while at the same time keeping an eye on what it was actually translated from.</p>
<p>Note that <span class="RVadded">greyed words</span> in the <em>RV</em> are words that the translators
consider were most probably in the mind of the writer, but as none of us can double-check
with the original speakers or writers, the reader is free to disagree.
They are clearly marked because we’ve tried to be as honest and transparent as possible.</p>
<p>The <span class="added">lighter coloured words</span> in the <em>LV</em> are words which
aren’t needed in the grammar of the original languages but are required or implied in English.
You can read the <a href="index.html#Key">Key</a> to learn more about them.
The underlines in the <em>LV</em> show when one original language word needs to be translated into two or more English words.
(Just hide them with the button if you don’t need that information and find it distracting.)
Also, the majority of sentences in the <em>LV</em> don’t have the words
put into a sensible English order yet.
(This should be completed by the end of 2023.)</p>
<p>The <span class="nominaSacra">bold words</span>
in the <em>LV New Testament</em> are
<a href="https://BibleQuestions.info/2020/01/25/what-are-nomina-sacra/">words</a>
that the original writers or copyists
marked to indicate that they considered them to refer to God.
<small>(Sadly, this information is not displayed in most Bible translations,
especially since it seems to clearly confirm that the earliest writers/copyists
considered both Jesus and the Holy Spirit to be God.)</small></p>
<p class="mt1">Titus</p>
<p class="shortPrayer">It is our prayer that the
<em>Open English Translation</em> of the Bible will give you a clear understanding of
the accounts and messages written by the God-inspired Biblical writers.</p>
<div class="bookIntro"><p class="is1">Introduction</p>
<p class="is2">The author</p>
<p class="ip">Paul</p>
<p class="is2">The recipient</p>
<p class="ip">Titus wasn’t a Jew and didn’t originally believe in God. However, in later times he became a believer and from there, he became a helper in Paul’s work. This letter was sent by Paul there to Titus in Crete where he had been left to look after a group of believers. (Crete is an island that was a part of Greece.)</p>
<p class="is2">This letter</p>
<p class="ip">There are three main things contained in this letter: Firstly Titus is reminded about what is appropriate behaviour for teachers of believers. It was important that he understand this because those from Crete had many undesirable customs and there were many teachers of false doctrines that would confuse believers.</p>
<p class="ip">Secondly Titus was advised Titus how to teach the various groups of believers there, including young men and slaves, along with older men and women. (Then those older women were to teach the younger women.)</p>
<p class="ip">Finally Paul advised Titus about how believers should live, including avoiding attacking others, arguing, and splitting the believers into opposing groups. Paul reminded Titus again to follow the teachings of Jesus the messiah and obey what he commanded us.</p>
<p class="ip">Paul wanted it to be known that it’s very important for believers to behave well (1:6; 2:7,14; 3:1,8-9,14) even though doing good things can’t earn their salvation (3:5).</p>
