<p>Note: This is still a very early look into the unfinished text
    of the <em>Open English Translation</em> of the Bible.
Please double-check the text before using in public.
Some things (like capitalisation of “him” referring to Jesus or “father” referring to God)
    in the <em>RV</em> haven’t been decided yet so we’re still testing both ways.</p>
<p>Note: The <em>Readers’ Version</em> on the left is a translation
into contemporary English aimed at <i>the person on the street</i> who
hasn’t necessarily been brought up with exposure to Biblical jargon and/or King James English.
It’s designed to be used alongside the <em>Literal Version</em> on the right which gives
the English reader a window into what’s actually written in the original languages.
(See the <a href="index.html#Intro">introduction</a> for more details—we
recommend that you read the introduction first if you’re wanting to fully understand the <em>Literal Version</em>.)
By comparing the left and right columns, you should be able to easily get the message of the text,
while at the same time keeping an eye on what it was actually translated from.</p>
<p class="mt1">Jonah</p>
<p class="shortPrayer">It is our prayer that the
<em>Open English Translation</em> of the Bible will give you clear understanding of
the messages written by the inspired Biblical writers.</p>

<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V3">3 </span>But Jonah=P decided to run away from Yahweh=GYHWH so he went down to Joppa=L (Heb: Yafo) and found a ship about to go to Tarshish=L. He paid the fare and went aboard to go with them to Tarshish=L to get away from Yahweh=GYHWH.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V4">4 </span>However Yahweh=GYHWH caused a strong wind on the sea and it became a such big storm that they all thought the ship would disintegrate. <span class="V" id="C1V5">5 </span>The sailors were afraid and they each cried to their own gods for help, and they threw the cargo overboard to make the ship lighter. But Jonah=P had gone down into the hold where he had laid down and fallen fast asleep.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V6">6 </span>So the ship’s captain approached him and said, “Why are you sleeping? Come on, pray to your God and perhaps he will take notice of us so we won’t die.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V7">7 </span>Then the sailors said to each other, “Let’s draw straws to find out whose fault it is that we are in this predicament.” So they drew straws and Jonah=P was indicated. <span class="V" id="C1V8">8 </span>So they said to him, “Hey, tell us why this disaster is happening to us. What is your occupation? Where are you from? What country? What nationality are you?”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V9">9 </span>And he said to them, “I’m a Hebrew and I fear Yahweh=GYHWH the God of the heavens who made the sea and the land.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V10">10 </span>And the men became really scared and asked him what he had done, because he had told them that he was running from Yahweh.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V11">11 </span>So they asked him what they should do to him so that the sea would calm, because the storm was getting worse.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V12">12 </span>And he said to them, “Pick me up and throw me into the sea so that the sea will calm down because I know that this terrible storm came because of me.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V13">13 </span>However, the men tried to row but they were not able to return to the land because the sea was very rough and getting worse. <span class="V" id="C1V14">14 </span>So they called to Yahweh=GYHWH and said, “We beg you Yahweh: please don’t let us die because of this man, and don’t consider us guilty because you yourself have made this happen.” <span class="V" id="C1V15">15 </span>And then they picked up Jonah=P and threw him into the sea, and the sea became calm. <span class="V" id="C1V16">16 </span>The men felt really scared of Yahweh=GYHWH and they sacrificed to him and made vows.</p>
