<p>Note: This is still a very early look into the unfinished text
    of the <em>Open English Translation</em> of the Bible.
Please double-check the text before using in public.
Some things (like capitalisation of “him” referring to Jesus or “father” referring to God)
    in the <em>RV</em> haven’t been decided yet so we’re still testing both ways.</p>
<p>Note: The <em>Readers’ Version</em> on the left is a translation
into contemporary English aimed at <i>the person on the street</i> who
hasn’t necessarily been brought up with exposure to Biblical jargon and/or King James English.
It’s designed to be used alongside the <em>Literal Version</em> on the right which gives
the English reader a window into what’s actually written in the original languages.
(See the <a href="index.html#Intro">introduction</a> for more details—we
recommend that you read the introduction first if you’re wanting to fully understand the <em>Literal Version</em>.)
By comparing the left and right columns, you should be able to easily get the message of the text,
while at the same time keeping an eye on what it was actually translated from.</p>
<p class="mt2">The second letter from</p>
<p class="mt1">Peter</p>
<p class="shortPrayer">It is our prayer that the
<em>Open English Translation</em> of the Bible will give you clear understanding of
the messages written by the inspired Biblical writers.</p>

 <span class="V" id="C1V3">3 </span>He=PJesus has given us everything necessary for life and godliness through his=PJesus divine power as we know the one who called us to his own glory and moral excellence. <span class="V" id="C1V4">4 </span>Through these things, he=PJesus has given us precious and very great promises that you will become participants of the divine nature after escaping the corruption in the world of lust. <span class="V" id="C1V5">5 </span>For this same reason, work hard to apply your faith adding moral excellence, and to that excellence add knowledge; <span class="V" id="C1V6">6 </span>to that knowledge add self-control; to that self-control add endurance; to that endurance add godliness; <span class="V" id="C1V7">7 </span>to that godliness add brotherly concern; and to the brotherly concern add selfless love. <span class="V" id="C1V8">8 </span>Because if these things are part of you and continually increasing, your knowledge of our Lord {Jesus Christ}=PJesus won’t become useless or unproductive. <span class="V" id="C1V9">9 </span>But if these things aren’t part of someone, that person is shortsighted as if they’ve forgotten that prior cleansing of their sins.</p>

 <span id="C3"></span><span class="C" id="C3V1">3</span>This is now my second letter to you my friends—both of which were sent as reminders to stir up your minds to sincerely <span class="V" id="C3V2">2 </span>remember the words spoken in the past by the holy prophets as well as the instruction of the Lord and saviour that came via your apostles. <span class="V" id="C3V3">3 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Hud 18.">[ref]</span>Firstly you should know that mockers will come during the last days, scoffing, following their own lusts <span class="V" id="C3V4">4 </span>and saying, “What about his promised return? Everything has just continued as usual from the beginning of creation right past the time when the ancestors died. <span class="V" id="C3V5">5 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Gen 1:6-9.">[ref]</span>But because of their desires, the truth is hidden from them that the universe came into being long ago by God’s word and the earth was formed out of water and through water <span class="V" id="C3V6">6 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Gen 7:11.">[ref]</span>and these same waters deluged the ancient world which then perished. <span class="V" id="C3V7">7 </span>But the present universe and the earth have been preserved by that same word to be kept for fire in the day of judgement and destruction of those who are ungodly.</p>
<p class="p">
</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C3V8">8 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Psa 90:4.">[ref]</span>But don’t let this one thing escape your attention my dear friends, that one day for us is like a thousand years with the Lord, and a thousand years is like one day. <span class="V" id="C3V9">9 </span>The Lord isn’t slow in fulfilling his promise as some consider slowness, but is patient toward you—not wanting anyone to perish but rather wanting everyone to come to repentance.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C3V10">10 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Mat 24:43; Luk 12:39; 1Tis 5:2; Rev 16:15.">[ref]</span>But the day of the Lord will come like a thief, when the universe will suddenly pass away, its components will burn up and be destroyed, and the earth and what happened on it will be examined. <span class="V" id="C3V11">11 </span>Since all these things will be destroyed, what kind of people should you be? Holy and godly in conduct, <span class="V" id="C3V12">12 </span>waiting for and hastening the coming of the day of God when the universe will be set alight and destroyed and its components will melt as they burn up. <span class="V" id="C3V13">13 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Isa 65:17; 66:22; Rev 21:1.">[ref]</span>But we await a new universe and a new earth filled with righteousness according to his promise.</p>
<p class="p">
</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C3V14">14 </span>And so dear friends, while you await these events be eager and found to be at peace with him—spotless and blameless. <span class="V" id="C3V15">15 </span>And consider the patience of our Lord as leading to salvation as our dear brother Paul wrote to you using the wisdom that has been given to him. <span class="V" id="C3V16">16 </span>He speaks in all his letters concerning these things, some of which are hard to understand and which ignorant and unstable people twist just like they twist the other scriptures to their own destruction.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C3V17">17 </span>So knowing this in advance dear friends, guard yourselves in case you fall from your own stable position with the same errors as the lawless ones. <span class="V" id="C3V18">18 </span>Rather grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and saviour Kesus Christ. May the glory be his, both now and through the days of eternity. Amen.</p>
