<p>Note: This is still a very early look into the unfinished text
of the <em>Open English Translation</em> of the Bible.
Please double-check the text in advance before using in public.</p><p>Note: This <em>Readers' Version</em> is a translation
into contemporary English aimed at <i>the person on the street</i> who
hasn't necessarily been brought up with exposure to Biblical jargon and/or 500-year old English.
(It's designed to be used alongside the <em>Literal Version</em> which gives
the English reader a window into what's actually written in the original languages.
(See the <a href="../LiteralVersion/index.html#Intro">introduction</a> for more details—we
recommend that you read the introduction first if you're wanting to read and understand the <em>Literal Version</em>.)
Between the two versions you should be able to easily read the clear message of the text,
while at the same time being able to check for yourself if that's a fair translation
of what the original authors had inked onto their ancient manuscripts.)</p>
<p>Note that <span class="RVadded">greyed words</span> are words that the translators
consider were most probably in the mind of the writer, but as none of us can double-check
with the original speakers or writers, the reader is free to disagree.
They are clearly marked because we have tried to be as honest / transparent as possible.</p>

 <span class="V" id="C1V2">2 </span>My dear friend, I trust that you are healthy and doing well in everything just as you are also doing well spiritually. <span class="V" id="C1V3">3 </span>I was very happy when some of our <span class="RVadded">spiritual</span> brothers came and told us about your faithfulness to the truth and how you are living it out. <span class="V" id="C1V4">4 </span>Nothing makes me more happy than hearing that other believers that I’ve helped are living out the truth.</p>

 <span class="V" id="C1V5">5 </span>My dear friend, you are fatihful in what you do for other believers. Even strangers <span class="V" id="C1V6">6 </span>have told the assembly about your caring for them before sending them on. Your actions will be praised by God <span class="V" id="C1V7">7 </span>because they went out to serve God, not getting any help from the unbelievers. <span class="V" id="C1V8">8 </span>We should be supporting believers like them so that we may also become their workmates in sharing the truth.</p>

<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V11">11 </span>My dear friend, don’t copy the evil things <span class="RVadded">that others do</span>, just the good things. Anyone who does what is good belongs to God—whoever does evil things has not seen God.</p>
