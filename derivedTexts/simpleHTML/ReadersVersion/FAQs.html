<h1>Open English Translation Readers’ Version (OET-RV) Development</h1>
<h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>

<h3 id="sectionHeadings">Why are section headings in boxes in this <em>Readers’ Version</em>?</h3>
<p>As explained in the <a href="index.html#sectionHeadings">Introduction</a>,
 many other English Bible translations break the text and put section headings right across the column.
This can tend to encourage the reader to read the text in unnatural chunks
 that were never divided by the author.
The <em>OET</em> on the other hand wants to educate readers that the narratives
 and prophecies and letters, etc., were written as contiguous documents.
Hence our section headings are designed not to break the text any more than necessary.</p>

<h3 id="paraphrase">Is the <em>Readers’ Version</em> a paraphrase?</h3>
<p>Well, it’s close, in fact you could debate all day about what a paraphrase is.
The short answer is that we don’t regard the <em>RV</em> as a paraphrase,
 but rather as a modern language translation.
Our goal with the <em>RV</em> is to take both the words and cultural background
 of the original authors, and express the meaning in the modern language of our generation.
We’ve tried to avoid <i>Bible jargon</i> (words that you’d only hear in church),
 and to think carefully about how we might explain it on the street.
So we’ve done the hard work for you to make the Bible accessible
 and understandable to the average person.
And always remember that the <em>OET</em> provides a <em>Literal Version</em>
 that it’s intended be referred to alongside this <em>Readers’ Version</em>.
(This does mean that we were able to break away from ancient/traditional Bible wording
 and think carefully about how we’d say that these days.)</p>

<h3 id="bold">What are the bolded words in the text?</h3>
<p>As explained in the <a href="index.html#Key">Key</a>, the bold text
 indicates the use of <em>Nomina Sacra</em> on the original manuscripts.
These are special markings and abbreviations done by the scribes,
 and in the earliest manuscripts, highlight words that are assumed to relate to God.</p>

<h3 id="Feedback">Feedback</h3>
<p>These web pages are a very preliminary preview into a work still in progress.
 The <em>OET Readers’ Version</em> is not yet finished, and not yet publicly released,
 but we need to have it available online for easy access for our checkers and reviewers.
 If you’re reading this and have questions that aren’t discussed here,
 please do contact us by <a href="mailto:Freely.Given.org@gmail.com?subject=OET-RV FAQs">email</a>.
 Also if there’s something that we didn’t explain in this introduction, or didn’t explain very well.
 Thanks.</p>
