<p class="mt2">The second account by</p>
<p class="mt1">Luke</p>
<p class="mt2">commonly called</p>
<p class="mt1">Acts</p>
<div class="bookIntro"><p class="is1">Introduction</p>
<p class="is2">Author</p>
<p class="ip">This account commonly known as <span class="bk">The Acts of the Ambassadors of Jesus the Messiah</span>, is the continuation of <span class="bk">The Good Message according to Luke</span>, and unlike most other Bibles, the <em>Open English Translation</em> places these two accounts one after the other.</p>
<p class="is2">This account</p>
<p class="ip">The main purpose of this account is to tell about the actions of the first followers of Jesus the messiah. The spirit of the master helped them to proclaim good message about him “in Jerusalem and in the entire <span class="RVadded">provinces of</span> Judea and Samaria, and all the way to the furtherest reaches of the earth” (1:8).</p>
<p class="ip">This document has three divisions related to the expanding circles as the good message from Jesus the messiah became spread wider and wider: (1) In Jerusalem where the believers start to get organised after Jesus ascended up into the clouds; (2) the work and the message spreads wider out to all of the district of Judea; and (3) spreading more widely again around the Mediteranean Ocean and all the way to Rome.</p>
<p class="ip">It’s also documented here about how God’s spirit came to the believers as they were together in a room in Jerusalem at the Feast of Pentecost (50 days after The Passover). The spirit helps and gives wisdom and strength to the believers and teachers of believers.</p>
<p class="iot">Main components of Luke’s second account</p>
<p class="io1">The believers begin to get organised <a href="#C1V1">1:1-26</a></p>

<p class="p">
 <span id="C1"></span><span class="C" id="C1V1">1 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Luk 1:1-4.">[ref]</span>Dear Theophilus, I wrote my first account about all the things that Jesus began to do and to teach <span class="V" id="C1V2">2 </span>until the day when he was taken up<span class="xref" title="See also Luk 24:51.">[ref]</span> <span class="RVadded">into the sky</span> after, with the help of the pure spirit, having commanded the ambassadors that he had chosen.</p>
<div class="rightBox"><p class="s1"><span class="CV">1:3</span> Jesus, alive, tells them to wait</p>
</div><!--rightBox-->
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V3">3 </span>After the time of his suffering, Jesus presented himself to them in ways that were infallible proofs <span class="RVadded">that he was alive again</span>—appearing to them and telling them about God’s kingdom. <span class="V" id="C1V4">4 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Luk 24:49.">[ref]</span>Once when they were together, he told them, “Don’t leave Jerusalem, but wait there for what was promised by the father, as you all have <span class="RVadded">already</span> heard me say. <span class="V" id="C1V5">5 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Mat 3:11; Mrk 1:8; Luk 3:16; Jn 1:33.">[ref]</span>John immersed <span class="RVadded">people</span> in water, but you all will be immersed in the pure spirit in just a few days.”</p>
<div class="rightBox"><p class="s1"><span class="CV">1:6</span> Jesus’ ascension</p>
</div><!--rightBox-->
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V6">6 </span>So when they were <span class="RVadded">next</span> gathered together, they asked him, “Master, is this now the time when you’ll be restoring the kingdom to Israel?”<span class="fn" title="Note: At the time of asking, the Israelis were burdened under the rule and taxes of the Roman invaders.">[fn]</span></p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V7">7 </span>But Jesus responded to them, “You don’t need to know the times or seasons <span class="RVadded">when future events will happen</span>—it’s the father who decides all that. <span class="V" id="C1V8">8 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Mat 28:19; Mrk 16:15; Luk 24:47-48.">[ref]</span>However, you all will be receiving power when the pure spirit lands on you. Then you’ll tell <span class="RVadded">people</span> about me in Jerusalem and in the entire <span class="RVadded">provinces of</span> Judea and Samaria, and all the way to the furtherest reaches of the earth. <span class="V" id="C1V9">9 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Mrk 16:19; Luk 24:50-51.">[ref]</span>After he’d said that and while they were still looking at him, he was lifted up <span class="RVadded">into the sky</span> until they could no longer see him because of the cloud<span class="RVadded">s</span>.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V10">10 </span>As they stood there staring into the sky after he’d gone, suddenly two men in white clothes were standing beside them <span class="V" id="C1V11">11 </span>and said, “You men from Galilee! Why are you still standing there looking up at the sky? This Jesus who has been taken up away from you into heaven will come back in the same way that you saw him go up into heaven.”</p>
<div class="rightBox"><p class="s1"><span class="CV">1:12</span> Matthias replaces Judas Iscariot</p>
</div><!--rightBox-->
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V12">12 </span>Then they descended the Mount of Olives and returned to Jerusalem which was less than a kilometre away. <span class="V" id="C1V13">13 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Mat 10:2-4; Mrk 3:16-19; Luk 6:14-16.">[ref]</span>They went into the upstairs room where they were staying—Peter and John, Jacob and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, Jacob (son of Alpheus), Simon (the Zealot member), and Judas (son of Jacob). <span class="V" id="C1V14">14 </span>They were united in their ongoing prayers, along with Miriam the mother of Jesus, and his brothers.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V15">15 </span>Then one day, Peter stood up in the meeting of the believers (about 120 of them) and said, <span class="V" id="C1V16">16 </span>“Brothers, it was necessary for the scripture to be fulfilled, where the pure spirit had spoken previously through David about Judas, the one who guided those that arrested Jesus <span class="V" id="C1V17">17 </span>because Judas was one of us and took his part in our work.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V18">18 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Mat 27:3-8.">[ref]</span>(Judas had bought a field with the money he had received for his treachery, and when he had fallen down <span class="RVadded">in that field</span>, his stomach had burst open and his intestines had slid out <span class="RVadded">on the ground</span>. <span class="V" id="C1V19">19 </span>So everyone in Jerusalem started calling that place ‘The field of blood’.)</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V20">20 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Psa 69:25; b Psa 109:8.">[ref]</span>Now it was written in the scroll of songs:</p>
<p class="q1">‘Let his place become deserted with no one living there,’
</p>
<p class="m">and
</p>
<p class="q1">‘Let another person take his position.’
</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V21">21 </span>So now it’s appropriate for one of the men that has been with us for the whole time that the master Jesus was interacting with us, <span class="V" id="C1V22">22 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Mat 3:16; Mrk 1:9; Luk 3:21; b Mrk 16:19; Luk 24:51.">[ref]</span>from Jesus’ immersion by John until the day that he was lifted up from us <span class="RVadded">into the clouds</span>—a witness of the resurrection—to fill this position.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V23">23 </span>So they selected two men: Joseph Barsabbas (nicknamed Justus) and Matthias. <span class="V" id="C1V24">24 </span>Then they requested, “Master, you know everyone’s inner thoughts, so reveal to us which of these two that you have chosen <span class="V" id="C1V25">25 </span>to take this position of service and being an ambassador—the position that Judas deserted to go to his own place.” <span class="V" id="C1V26">26 </span>So they drew straws and Matthias was marked so he was chosen to join the eleven ambassadors.</p>
<div class="rightBox"><p class="s1"><span class="CV">2:1</span> God’s spirit arrives and many get saved</p>

<p class="p">
 <span id="C2"></span><span class="C" id="C2V1">2 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Lev 23:15-21; Deu 16:9-11.">[ref]</span>When the Day of Pentecost actually arrived, the believers met together in the same room. <span class="V" id="C2V2">2 </span>Suddenly there was a noise in the sky that sounded like a strong wind, then it filled the entire house where they were sitting. <span class="V" id="C2V3">3 </span>They saw what looked like tongues of fire that kept dividing<span class="fn" title="Note: See https://www.billmounce.com/monday-with-mounce/what-%E2%80%9Cdivided-tongue%E2%80%9D-acts-2-3-0">[fn]</span> and then settling down on each one of them. <span class="V" id="C2V4">4 </span>In this way they were all filled with the pure spirit and began speaking in other languages as the spirit enabled them.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C2V5">5 </span>At the time, there were godly Jews staying in Jerusalem that had come from other countries all around the world. <span class="V" id="C2V6">6 </span>When they heard this noise, lots of people came to investigate but they were confused because they heard the believers talking in their own languages <span class="RVadded">from around the world</span>. <span class="V" id="C2V7">7 </span>They were astounded and marvelled, asking, “Wow, aren’t these people talking all Galileans? <span class="V" id="C2V8">8 </span>So how come we’re hearing them speak the languages of the countries where we were born? <span class="V" id="C2V9">9 </span>There’s people here from Parthia, Media, Elam, Mesopotamia, Judea, Cappadocia, Pontus, Asia, <span class="V" id="C2V10">10 </span>Phrygia, Pamphylia, Egypt, Libya (near Cyrene), and visitors from Rome, <span class="V" id="C2V11">11 </span>Crete, and Arabia. Some are Jews and some are non-Jews who’ve converted <span class="RVadded">to Judaism</span>. And we can hear them talking about God in our languages.” <span class="V" id="C2V12">12 </span>Everyone was amazed and totally puzzled, asking each other, “What’s going on here?” <span class="V" id="C2V13">13 </span>But others scoffed and said, “Ha, they’ve just had too much to drink.”</p>
<div class="rightBox"><p class="s1"><span class="CV">2:14</span> Peter’s sermon</p>
</div><!--rightBox-->
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C2V14">14 </span>So the twelve stood up and Peter told the crowd in a loud voice, “People of Judea and everyone staying in Jerusalem. Listen to me so that I can explain this to you. <span class="V" id="C2V15">15 </span>This group is not drunk like you’re all thinking, because it’s still mid-morning, <span class="V" id="C2V16">16 </span>but you’re seeing what the prophet Joel wrote about:</p>
<p class="q1">
 <span class="V" id="C2V17">17 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Joel 2:28-32 (LXX).">[ref]</span>God said, ‘In the last days I will pour out my spirit on all humanity—your children will tell of future events, your young men will see visions, and your old men will have dreams <span class="RVadded">from God</span>. <span class="V" id="C2V18">18 </span>I will pour my spirit out on my male and female slaves and they will tell of future events. <span class="V" id="C2V19">19 </span>I will do unusual things with the stars and planets, and also down on the earth below: blood, fire, and clouds of smoke. <span class="V" id="C2V20">20 </span>I’ll make the sun go dark and the moon go blood red. This will happen before the great victorious day of the coming of the master. <span class="V" id="C2V21">21 </span>Then everyone who relies on the name and authority of the master will be saved.’</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C2V22">22 </span>“Fellow Israelis, listen to this account: You yourselves know that God did miracles through Jesus from Nazareth, and he fulfilled signs <span class="RVadded">from the scriptures</span>—in fact God did this right in front of you. <span class="V" id="C2V23">23 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Mat 27:35; Mrk 15:24; Luk 23:33; Jn 19:18.">[ref]</span>Then as part of God’s plan and foreknowledge, this Jesus was taken to the authorities by those who didn’t follow their own laws, and you all killed him by having him executed on a pole. <span class="V" id="C2V24">24 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Mat 28:5-6; Mrk 16:6; Luk 24:5.">[ref]</span>But God released him from the agonies of death and brought him back to life—death couldn’t restrain him. <span class="V" id="C2V25">25 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Psa 16:8-11 (LXX).">[ref]</span>As David wrote,</p>
<p class="q1">‘I foresaw the master always being in front of me. I refuse to be afraid because he’s there on my right.
</p>
<p class="q1">
 <span class="V" id="C2V26">26 </span>Because of that, I was happy and spoke out my praises. My whole body lives in anticipation <span class="V" id="C2V27">27 </span>because you will never abandon my soul in Hades, nor will you allow the godly one to decay. <span class="V" id="C2V28">28 </span>You showed me the roads to life. You fill me with gladness because of your presence.’</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C2V29">29 </span>“Fellow Israelis, we can tell you all with confidence that our patriarch David both died and was buried, and his tomb is still here with us today. <span class="V" id="C2V30">30 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Psa 132:11; 2Sam 7:12-13.">[ref]</span>So because he was a prophet, and knowing that God has promised him to seat one of his descendants on his throne, <span class="V" id="C2V31">31 </span>he was foretelling the resurrection of the messiah who was neither ‘abandoned in Hades nor did his body decay.’ <span class="V" id="C2V32">32 </span>Then God raised this Jesus back to life and we’re all witnesses of that. <span class="V" id="C2V33">33 </span>Now he’s sitting at God’s right hand, and having received the promise of the pure spirit from the father, he poured this out which you are all seeing and hearing <span class="RVadded">today</span>. <span class="V" id="C2V34">34 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Psa 110:1.">[ref]</span>You see, David never went up to the heavens, but he himself said,</p>
<p class="q1">‘The master said to my master: Sit down at my right
</p>
<p class="q1">
 <span class="V" id="C2V35">35 </span>until I defeat your enemies.’</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C2V36">36 </span>“So let all Israel know that this Jesus that you executed on a pole, God made him both the master and the messiah.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C2V37">37 </span>When the people heard that, they were deeply troubled and asked Peter and the other ambassadors, “What should we do then, brothers?”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C2V38">38 </span>Peter responded, “Turn away <span class="RVadded">from your sins</span> and each one of you needs to be immersed by the authority of Jesus the messiah. Then your sins will be forgiven and you all will receive the gift of the pure spirit, <span class="V" id="C2V39">39 </span>because that promise is to you all and your children and to their descendants—to anyone who will call out to the master, our God.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C2V40">40 </span>Then Peter shared further teaching with them and encouraged them to save themselves out from this corrupt generation. <span class="V" id="C2V41">41 </span>Because of that, those who welcomed his teaching were immersed and about three thousand people were added to their numbers that day. <span class="V" id="C2V42">42 </span>They continued listening to the teaching of the ambassadors, and in building their relationships with each other, and in breaking bread and praying together.</p>

<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C2V43">43 </span>They were serious in their learning about God, and the ambassadors did many miracles and signs of God’s power in Jerusalem and all the people wanted to be right with God. <span class="V" id="C2V44">44 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Acts 4:32-35.">[ref]</span>All those who did believe were united in purpose and had shared use of many things. <span class="V" id="C2V45">45 </span>Some sold their properties and possessions and divided them among the group so that everyone had everything they needed. <span class="V" id="C2V46">46 </span>Each day they <span class="RVadded">worshipped</span> together at the temple and also went to various homes to break bread together.

<p class="p">
 <span id="C3"></span><span class="C" id="C3V1">3 </span>One afternoon at 3pm, Peter and John were going to the prayer meeting in the temple. <span class="V" id="C3V2">2 </span>Now there was a man who had been lame from birth and everyday, was placed beside a door of the temple.

With the authority of Jesus the messiah from Nazareth, <span class="RVadded">I command you</span> to walk.” <span class="V" id="C3V7">7 </span>Then Peter grabbed him by the right hand and pulled him upwards. Immediately the man’s feet and ankles were strengthened <span class="V" id="C3V8">8 </span>and he jumped up and stood and started walking and went into the temple with them, walking and skipping and praising God. <span class="V" id="C3V9">9 </span>All the people <span class="RVadded">there</span> saw him walking and praising </span> God <span class="V" id="C3V10">10 </span>and recognising that he was the man who usually sat <span class="RVadded">outside</span> begging at the ‘Beautiful Door’ of the temple, they were astonished and astounded at what had happened to him.</p>

 <span id="C4"></span><span class="C" id="C4V1">4 </span>While Peter and John were still talking to the people, the chief priests and a temple officer and some from the Sadducee sect approached them <span class="V" id="C4V2">2 </span>because they were very upset about what they had been teaching the people, including preaching that Jesus could give life to the dead. <span class="V" id="C4V3">3 </span>So they arrested the two, and as it was already evening, they put them in jail overnight. <span class="V" id="C4V4">4 </span>Despite this, many people who had heard their message trusted <span class="RVadded">in Jesus</span> and the number of men who were believers grew to around 5,000.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V5">5 </span>Then the next day, the religious leaders and the elders and the religious teachers gathered together in Jerusalem <span class="V" id="C4V6">6 </span>along with those descended from high priests, including Annas the current high priest and Caiaphas and John and Alexander. <span class="V" id="C4V7">7 </span>After <span class="RVadded">having Peter and John brought in and</span> standing them in the middle, they began to ask, “Under what authority or name did you do this?”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V8">8 </span>Then Peter, having been filled with the pure spirit, said to them, “Rulers of the people and elders, <span class="V" id="C4V9">9 </span>if we’re being questioned today about a good deed done to a man who couldn’t walk and which resulted in his healing, <span class="V" id="C4V10">10 </span>then you all need to know, and the people of Israel should also know that it was done under the authority and name of Jesus the messiah. He was the man from Nazareth that you executed on a pole, but who God brought back to life.

<p class="m">
 <span class="V" id="C4V12">12 </span>We can’t be saved by anyone else, because there’s no other name or authority that’s been given in the entire world under which people can be saved.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V13">13 </span>The assembled leaders were amazed saw the boldness of Peter and John who they knew to be illiterate, working-class men, and then recognised that they had been with Jesus. <span class="V" id="C4V14">14 </span>But since the man who was no longer deformed was standing there with them, there was nothing that they could really accuse them of. <span class="V" id="C4V15">15 </span>So they had them removed from the room, and asked each other, <span class="V" id="C4V16">16 </span>“What should we do with these fellows? By now everyone in Jerusalem’s heard about the miracle they did, and we have no way to rebuff it.” <span class="V" id="C4V17">17 </span>However, we have to stop it spreading even further, so maybe we should ban them from speaking about this name <span class="RVadded">or authority</span> to anyone. <span class="V" id="C4V18">18 </span>So they called them back in and decreed that they weren’t allowed to preach or teach under the name <span class="RVadded">or authority</span> of Jesus anymore.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V19">19 </span>But Peter and John answered, “You judge <span class="RVadded">for yourselves</span> whether it’s right in God’s eyes to listen to you rather than to him? <span class="V" id="C4V20">20 </span>As for us, we’re not able to be silent about what we saw and heard.” <span class="V" id="C4V21">21 </span>So after making some further threats, the leaders sent them off.

 <span id="C5"></span><span class="C" id="C5V1">5 </span>But in contrast, a couple named Ananias and Sapphira sold a property <span class="V" id="C5V2">2 </span>but agreed together to hide some of the proceeds. So Ananias brought a smaller amount and put it down in front of the ambassadors. <span class="V" id="C5V3">3 </span>Then Peter said, “Ananias, why has Satan filled your mind such that you would lie to the pure spirit and keep aside some of the proceeds of the property? <span class="V" id="C5V4">4 </span>Wasn’t it yours before it was sold? And even when it was sold, the money was still yours. Why did you decide to handle it like this?

<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C5V7">7 </span>After about three hours, Ananias’ wife came in, not knowing anything about what had happened. <span class="V" id="C5V8">8 </span>Peter checked, “Is it true that you guys sold the property for such-and-such an amount?”</p>
<p class="p">“Yes, for that amount,” she replied.

<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C5V9">9 </span>But Peter said to her, “Why did the two of you agree to test the spirit of the master?

<div class="rightBox"><p class="s1"><span class="CV">5:17</span> The preachers get arrested but released again</p>
</div><!--rightBox-->
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C5V17">17 </span>But the chief priest and his colleagues who were members of the sect of Sadducees were filled with jealously and took action <span class="V" id="C5V18">18 </span>by having the ambassadors arrested and thrown into the public jail. <span class="V" id="C5V19">19 </span>But one of the master’s angels opened the prison doors during the night and led them out again, saying, <span class="V" id="C5V20">20 </span>“Now go and stand in the temple and keep telling the people all the teaching about <span class="RVadded">new</span> life.” <span class="V" id="C5V21">21 </span>So at dawn, having taken notice of the angel, they went into the temple and started teaching <span class="RVadded">the people there again</span>.</p>
<p class="p">When the chief priest arrived with his companions, they called together the <span class="RVadded">religious</span> council and also the <span class="RVadded">political</span> council of Israel, then called for the ambassadors to be brought in from the prison.
 <span class="V" id="C5V22">22 </span>But when their attendants got to the jail, they weren’t there, so they returned to the gathering and told them, <span class="V" id="C5V23">23 </span>“We found the prison all locked up with the guards in their positions at the doors, but when they opened it up, there was no one inside!” <span class="V" id="C5V24">24 </span>When they heard this, the officer of the temple and the chief priests were totally puzzled as to what could have happened. <span class="V" id="C5V25">25 </span>But then someone came in and told them, “Hey, the men that you put in prison are in the temple—standing there teaching the people.” <span class="V" id="C5V26">26 </span>So the temple officer took the attendants and went and got them, but didn’t use force because they were afraid that the people might start throwing rocks at them.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C5V27">27 </span>So they brought them in and stood them in front of the council, where the chief priest addressed them, <span class="V" id="C5V28">28 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Mat 27:25.">[ref]</span>“We officially commanded you all not to be teaching in this name and authority. But see here, now you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching, and then you’re blaming us for the death of that man.” <span class="V" id="C5V29">29 </span>But Peter and the other ambassadors answered, “It’s better to obey God than people. <span class="V" id="C5V30">30 </span>The god of our ancestors brought Jesus back to life after you all handed him over to be hung up on a pole. <span class="V" id="C5V31">31 </span>But God honoured this way-maker and saviour by placing him on his right, to <span class="RVadded">encourage</span> Israel to repent and <span class="RVadded">then</span> to forive their sins. <span class="V" id="C5V32">32 </span>We are witnesses of these messages, along with the pure spirit who God gave to the ones who obey him.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C5V33">33 </span>When the gathered councils heard this, they were enraged and wanted to kill them. <span class="V" id="C5V34">34 </span>But a certain member of the Pharisee party named Gamaliel stood up in the council chamber. He was a law teacher respected by all the community, and he ordered the <span class="RVadded">guards</span> to take them outside for a while, <span class="V" id="C5V35">35 </span>then he said, “Fellow Israelis, think carefully about what you’re planning to do with these men. <span class="V" id="C5V36">36 </span>A while back, a man called Theudas became prominent, saying that he was someone important. Eventually about four hundred others joined him, but he was killed and those who had followed him were dispersed and it all came to nothing. <span class="V" id="C5V37">37 </span>A bit later a Galilean man named Judas became prominent at the time of the census and he attracted people to him. But he also died, and all those who’d been persuaded by him ended up being scattered. <span class="V" id="C5V38">38 </span>So here’s my advice to you all: pull back from <span class="RVadded">killing</span> these men and allow them, because if this teaching and goings on is man-made, it’ll be overthrown, <span class="V" id="C5V39">39 </span>but if it’s from God, you all won’t be able to bring them down in the case that you find yourselves opposing God.”</p>
<p class="p">So they were persuaded by Gamaliel,
 <span class="V" id="C5V40">40 </span>and after calling in the ambassadors and having them beaten, they commanded them not to speak under the name and authority of Jesus and then sent them out. <span class="V" id="C5V41">41 </span>So the ambassadors left the councils, very excited that they were considered worthy to be disgraced because of Jesus. <span class="V" id="C5V42">42 </span>After that, they never stopped teaching and preaching the good message about Jesus the messiah in the temple and in various homes.</p>
<div class="rightBox"><p class="s1"><span class="CV">6:1</span> Seven administrators appointed</p>

<p class="p">
 <span id="C6"></span><span class="C" id="C6V1">6 </span>However around that time when the number of Jesus-followers were growing, some of the Greek converts starting grumbling about the Jewish believers because the Greek widows were being overlooked in the daily sharing <span class="RVadded">of food and money</span>. <span class="V" id="C6V2">2 </span>So the twelve <span class="RVadded">ambassadors</span> assembled the believers together and told them, “We’re not pleased about having to take time off <span class="RVadded">sharing</span> the message of God to be serving here at the <span class="RVadded">distribution</span> tables. <span class="V" id="C6V3">3 </span>So brothers, look around you for seven men who’re well known to be full of <span class="RVadded">God’s</span> spirit and wisdom, so we can appoint them to be in charge of this part of the work. <span class="V" id="C6V4">4 </span>Then we <span class="RVadded">ourselves</span> can continue to pray and share the message.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C6V5">5 </span>This idea pleased the group, so they went ahead and chose Stephen (a man full of faith and of the pure spirit), Philip, Procorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolas (a non-Jew from Antioch who had previously converted to Judaism). <span class="V" id="C6V6">6 </span>They stood these seven up in front of the ambassadors, who prayed and then placed their hands on them.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C6V7">7 </span>God’s message continued spreading and the number of followers in Jerusalem was rapidly increasing, and a large number of the priests became believers.</p>

 <span class="V" id="C9V32">32 </span>Peter travelled around the country and then went to visit the dedicated believers in Lydda. <span class="V" id="C9V33">33 </span>He saw a paralysed man named Aeneas who’d spent eight years lying on his pallet, <span class="V" id="C9V34">34 </span>and said to him, “Aeneas, Jesus the messiah is healing you. Stand up and pack up your bed.” And straight away Aeneas stood up <span class="V" id="C9V35">35 </span>and all the people living in Lydda and Sharon who saw him turned to the master.</p>

<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C9V36">36 </span>Then in Joppa there was a believer named Tabitha (or Dorcas if translated) and she did a lot of good things as well as being generous to the poor. <span class="V" id="C9V37">37 </span>Around that time she got sick and died. After washing her body, they placed it in an upper room, <span class="V" id="C9V38">38 </span>and since Joppa was near Lydda and the believers had heard that Peter was there, they quickly sent two men to request, “Please come as soon as possible.” <span class="V" id="C9V39">39 </span>So Peter went with them, and when they arrived in Joppa they took him up to the room. All the widows stood there, sobbing and showing him various clothes that Tabitha had made for them. <span class="V" id="C9V40">40 </span>But Peter had them all removed from the room, and then kneeling down he prayed before turning back to the body and said, “Tabitha, get up.” Then she opened her eyes, and seeing Peter there she sat up. <span class="V" id="C9V41">41 </span>Peter helped her to stand up, then he called the believers and the widows, and presented the live Tabitha to them. <span class="V" id="C9V42">42 </span>News of this spread throughout Joppa and many people there believed in the master. <span class="V" id="C9V43">43 </span>So Peter stayed on there for quite a few days, living with a tanner of hides named Simon.</p>
<div class="rightBox"><p class="s1"><span class="CV">10:1</span> Peter and Cornelius</p>
</div><!--rightBox-->
<p class="p">
 <span id="C10"></span><span class="C" id="C10V1">10 </span>Just up in Caesarea there was a Roman army commander named Cornelius (leader of the ‘Italian Regiment’) <span class="V" id="C10V2">2 </span>who, along with all his household, worshipped God and obeyed his laws. He gave to the poor and regularly asked God for help. <span class="V" id="C10V3">3 </span>One afternoon around 3pm he had a vision where he clearly saw an angel of God come into the house and spoke, “Cornelius.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C10V4">4 </span>Cornelius was scared and looked intently and asked, “What is it, master?”</p>
<p class="p">“Your prayers and your helping the poor rose up to God’s notice and attention,” he said.
 <span class="V" id="C10V5">5 </span>“Now, send some messengers to Joppa to go and find a man there named Simon Peter. <span class="V" id="C10V6">6 </span>He’s staying with Simon the tanner whose house is by the sea.” <span class="V" id="C10V7">7 </span>So as soon as the angel left, Cornelius called two of his house servants and a godly soldier from his bodyguard, <span class="V" id="C10V8">8 </span>and after explaining the task to them, he sent them off to Joppa.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C10V9">9 </span>The next day as they were approaching the town, Peter went up onto the flat roof of the house around midday to pray. <span class="V" id="C10V10">10 </span>But he felt hungry and wanted something to eat, but while it was still being prepared he fell into a trance <span class="V" id="C10V11">11 </span>and saw the sky open up. Something like a sheet was being lowered down to the earth by the four corners <span class="V" id="C10V12">12 </span>and it held all kinds of animal and reptiles, as well as birds. <span class="V" id="C10V13">13 </span>Then he heard a voice saying, “Get up Peter, and slaughter these and eat them.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C10V14">14 </span>“I can’t, master,” Peter responded, “because I’ve never eaten anything that’s forbidden.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C10V15">15 </span>But the voice spoke a second time, “Don’t you be treating anything as unclean that God has made clean.” <span class="V" id="C10V16">16 </span>This vision happened three times and then the sheet thing was lifted back up into the sky.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C10V17">17 </span>Now Peter was still there wondering what the vision was all about when the men sent by Cornelius had tracked down the tanner’s house and arrived outside. <span class="V" id="C10V18">18 </span>They called out to ask if Simon Peter was staying there.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C10V19">19 </span>Even as Peter still continued to ponder about the vision, the spirit said, “Hey, there’s three men here looking for you. <span class="V" id="C10V20">20 </span>So get up and go downstairs to them. Believe everything they say because I sent them here.” <span class="V" id="C10V21">21 </span>So he went down and asked the men, “I’m the one you’re looking for, so tell me what you came here for.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C10V22">22 </span>They answered, “We were sent by Cornelius who’s an army commander who worships God and obeys his laws and has a good reputation with you Jewish people. A holy angel told him to send for you to come to his house so they can listen to what you have to say.” <span class="V" id="C10V23">23 </span>So Peter invited them in to stay the night.</p>
<p class="p">The next day, Peter and some of the believers from Joppa started out with them
 <span class="V" id="C10V24">24 </span>and they arrived in Caesarea the following day. Cornelius was expecting them and had also invited some relatives and close friends to join them. <span class="V" id="C10V25">25 </span>Peter entered the house and when they met, Cornelius knelt down and worshipped him. <span class="V" id="C10V26">26 </span>But Peter pulled him up and said, “Stand up. I’m just a man like you.” <span class="V" id="C10V27">27 </span>After greeting each other, Peter went into the main room and found that quite a few people had gathered there. <span class="V" id="C10V28">28 </span>Then he told them, “You all know that us Jews are forbidden by our laws to associate with or to enter the house of a non-Jew. However, God showed me that it’s not right to treat other people as being lesser or undesirable. <span class="V" id="C10V29">29 </span>That’s why I came without any reservations when you sent for me. But I’m still waiting to know what you all want from me?”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C10V30">30 </span>So Cornelius answered, “” <span class="V" id="C10V31">31 </span>◘ <span class="V" id="C10V32">32 </span>◘ <span class="V" id="C10V33">33 </span>◘</p>
