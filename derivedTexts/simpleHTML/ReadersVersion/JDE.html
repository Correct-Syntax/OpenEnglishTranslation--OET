<p>Note: This is still a very early look into the unfinished text
of the <em>Open English Translation</em> of the Bible.
Please double-check the text in advance before using in public.</p><p>Note: This <em>Readers' Version</em> is a translation
into contemporary English aimed at <i>the person on the street</i> who
hasn't necessarily been brought up with exposure to Biblical jargon and/or 500-year old English.
(It's designed to be used alongside the <em>Literal Version</em> which gives
the English reader a window into what's actually written in the original languages.
(See the <a href="../LiteralVersion/index.html#Intro">introduction</a> for more details—we
recommend that you read the introduction first if you're wanting to read and understand the <em>Literal Version</em>.)
Between the two versions you should be able to easily read the clear message of the text,
while at the same time being able to check for yourself if that's a fair translation
of what the original authors had inked onto their ancient manuscripts.)</p>
<p>Note that <span class="RVadded">greyed words</span> are words that the translators
consider were most probably in the mind of the writer, but as none of us can double-check
with the original speakers or writers, the reader is free to disagree.
They are clearly marked because we have tried to be as honest / transparent as possible.</p>

<div class="bookIntro"><p class="is1">Introduction</p>
<p class="is2">Author</p>
<p class="ip">This letter was written by Judas the younger brother of James. (Note that he wasn’t the Judas who handed Jesus over to the Jewish religious leaders.)</p>
<p class="is2">This letter</p>
<p class="ip">We don’t know which group of believers that this letter was sent to. Here in this letter, Judas warns the believers about teachers of false doctrines who teach that it’s okay for believers to continue sinning since they’ll just be forgiven due to God’s mercy. That’s the reason Judas wrote this, to warn the believers so that they won’t fall for false beliefs, but instead will continue to follow the true teaching that came from God. He also encourages the readers that it’s necessary to strive to continue in their faith in God along with turning away from evil actions.</p>

It’s written to all those who have been called and loved by God the father and who have kept <span class="RVadded">believing</span> in Jesus the messiah.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V2">2 </span><span class="RVadded">I pray</span> that you all will experience <span class="RVadded">God’s</span> mercy and peace, and a bountiful supply of love.</p>
<div class="rightBox"><p class="s1"><span class="CV">1:3</span> The judgement of false-teachers and god-rejecters</p>
</div><!--rightBox-->
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V3">3 </span>Friends, I was so enthusiastic to write to you concerning our salvation that we have in common, but I needed to write to you all, encouraging you to stand strong for the teaching that was entrusted to the believers at a certain point in time. <span class="V" id="C1V4">4 </span>Because some people have quietly come into <span class="RVadded">our groups</span> who think they can take advantage of God’s grace to bring in immoral lifestyles and disowning the only master, and our master who is Jesus the messiah. But they are destined for judgement.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V5">5 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Exo 12:51; b Num 14:29-30.">[ref]</span>Now I want to remind you that although you all know how Jesus rescued our people out of Egypt, yet <span class="RVadded">at the same time</span> he destroyed the ones who didn’t believe. <span class="V" id="C1V6">6 </span>Even the angels who broke their own rules and left their own domain have been held in eternal chains in the darkness until the time of judgement in the great day. <span class="V" id="C1V7">7 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Gen 19:1-24.">[ref]</span>Similarly Sodom and Gomorrah and the towns around them stay in our minds as an example of the judgement of eternal fire due to similar sexual perversions.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V8">8 </span>in the same way these dreamers defile their own bodies while rejecting the master and dishonouring those who should be honoured. <span class="V" id="C1V9">9 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Dan 10:13,21; 12:1; Rev 12:7; b Deu 34:6; c Zech 3:2.">[ref]</span>Even Michael, <span class="RVadded">one of</span> the top angels, when he was arguing with the devil about Moses’ body, he didn’t belittle him, but left it to the master to punish him. <span class="V" id="C1V10">10 </span>But these people mock what they don’t even grasp, but they’ll be destroyed by what their animal instincts do understand. <span class="V" id="C1V11">11 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Gen 4:3-8; 1Jn 3:12; b Num 22–24; 31:16; 2Pe 2:15-16; c Num 16:1-35.">[ref]</span>Oh dear! Because they’ve followed the actions of Cain and have embraced the deception of Balaam for monetary gain, so too they’ll perish like Korah’s destruction. <span class="V" id="C1V12">12 </span>These are the people who ruin your love feasts when they eat without shame and only look after themselves. They’re like clouds that are blown away by the wind without bringing the needed rain or trees that don’t produce any fruit then are doubly useless by falling over; <span class="V" id="C1V13">13 </span>like wild waves in the ocean that foam in their own shame or like <span class="RVadded">unreliable </span> wandering stars that are already doomed to the darkest darkness in the next age.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V14">14 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Gen 5:18,21-24.">[ref]</span>Enoch (the seventh generation from Adam) prophesied <span class="RVadded">way back then</span> about these people, “Look, the master, surrounded by tens of thousands of his holy <span class="RVadded">angels</span>, came <span class="V" id="C1V15">15 </span>to sentence everybody and to punish everyone who rejected God for everything they did that demonstrated this rejection and everything they said against him.” <span class="V" id="C1V16">16 </span>This includes their grumbling and complaining, the fulfilling of their own lustful desires, the arrogant way that they spoke, and their flattering of others in order to gain from them.</p>
<div class="rightBox"><p class="s1"><span class="CV">1:17</span> Keep your faith and keep ministering to others</p>
</div><!--rightBox-->
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V17">17 </span>But you, friends, always be thinking about how the missionaries of our master Jesus the messiah <span class="V" id="C1V18">18 </span><span class="xref" title="See also 2Pe 3:3.">[ref]</span>told you that mockers near the end of time would come out following their own god-rejecting lusts. <span class="V" id="C1V19">19 </span>These people will cause division as they just demonstrate sensuality since they don’t know <span class="RVadded">God’s</span> spirit. <span class="V" id="C1V20">20 </span>But you, friends, work to increase your faith in God, praying as the pure spirit helps you. <span class="V" id="C1V21">21 </span>Keep receiving God’s love as you look forward to living forever thanks to the mercy of our master, Jesus the messiah.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V22">22 </span>Show grace to those <span class="RVadded">still</span> doubting <span class="V" id="C1V23">23 </span>whereas others need to be ‘snatched out of the fire’ in order to be saved.

 <span class="V" id="C1V24">24-</span><span class="V" id="C1V25">25 </span>Our master, Jesus the messiah, is the infallible one who is quite capable of looking after all of us so that we can stand blameless in front of him and praise him in his full honour and greatness. Let us honour and praise our only God and savior, acknowledging his greatness and power and authority through Jesus from before the creation, right through these current times, and in the age to come.
