<p>Note: This is still a very early look into the unfinished text
of the <em>Open English Translation</em> of the Bible.
Please double-check the text before using in public.</p><p>Note: This <em>Readers’ Version</em> is a translation
into contemporary English aimed at <i>the person on the street</i> who
hasn’t necessarily been brought up with exposure to Biblical jargon and/or King James English.
It’s designed to be used alongside the <em>Literal Version</em> which gives
the English reader a window into what’s actually written in the original languages.
(See the <a href="../LiteralVersion/index.html#Intro">introduction</a> for more details—we
recommend that you read the introduction first if you’re wanting to read and understand the <em>Literal Version</em>.)
Between the two versions you should be able to easily read the clear message of the text,
while at the same time being able to check for yourself if that’s a fair translation
of what the original authors had inked onto their ancient manuscripts.</p>

<div class="rightBox"><p class="s1"><span class="CV">1:1</span> Jonah=P tries to run from God</p>
</div><!--rightBox-->
<p class="p">
 <span id="C1"></span><span class="C" id="C1V1">1</span><span class="xref" title="See also 2Ki 14:25.">[ref]</span>Now Yahweh=GYHWH said to Jonah=P (Heb: Yonah) the son of Amittai=P, <span class="V" id="C1V2">2 </span>“Go now to the major city, Nineveh=L, and speak out against it because I’ve noticed how evil they are.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V3">3 </span>But Jonah=P decided to run away from Yahweh=GYHWH so he went down to Joppa=L (Heb: Yafo) and found a ship about to go to Tarshish=L. He paid the fare and went aboard to go with them to Tarshish=L to get away from Yahweh=GYHWH.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V4">4 </span>However Yahweh=GYHWH caused a strong wind on the sea and it became a such big storm that they all thought the ship would disintegrate. <span class="V" id="C1V5">5 </span>The sailors were afraid and they each cried to their own gods for help, and they threw the cargo overboard to make the ship lighter. But Jonah=P had gone down into the hold where he had laid down and fallen fast asleep.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V6">6 </span>So the ship’s captain approached him and said, “Why are you sleeping? Come on, pray to your God and perhaps he will take notice of us so we won’t die.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V7">7 </span>Then the sailors said to each other, “Let’s draw straws to find out whose fault it is that we are in this predicament.” So they drew straws and Jonah=P was indicated. <span class="V" id="C1V8">8 </span>So they said to him, “Hey, tell us why this disaster is happening to us. What is your occupation? Where are you from? What country? What nationality are you?”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V9">9 </span>And he said to them, “I’m a Hebrew and I fear Yahweh=GYHWH the God of the heavens who made the sea and the land.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V10">10 </span>And the men became really scared and asked him what he had done, because he had told them that he was running from Yahweh.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V11">11 </span>So they asked him what they should do to him so that the sea would calm, because the storm was getting worse.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V12">12 </span>And he said to them, “Pick me up and throw me into the sea so that the sea will calm down because I know that this terrible storm came because of me.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V13">13 </span>However, the men tried to row but they were not able to return to the land because the sea was very rough and getting worse. <span class="V" id="C1V14">14 </span>So they called to Yahweh=GYHWH and said, “We beg you Yahweh: please don’t let us die because of this man, and don’t consider us guilty because you yourself have made this happen.” <span class="V" id="C1V15">15 </span>And then they picked up Jonah=P and threw him into the sea, and the sea became calm. <span class="V" id="C1V16">16 </span>The men felt really scared of Yahweh=GYHWH and they sacrificed to him and made vows.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V17">17 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Mat 12:40.">[ref]</span>Then Yahweh=GYHWH commanded a huge fish to swallow Jonah=P and he stayed in the belly of the fish for three days and three nights.</p>
<div class="rightBox"><p class="s1"><span class="CV">2:1</span> Jonah’s prayer</p>
</div><!--rightBox-->
<p class="p">
 <span id="C2"></span><span class="C" id="C2V1">2</span>And Jonah=P prayed to Yahweh=GYHWH his God from the belly of the fish. <span class="V" id="C2V2">2 </span>And he said,</p>
<p class="q1">“I called to you Yahweh=GYHWH in my distress and you answered me. I cried for help from the valley of death and you heard my voice.
 <span class="V" id="C2V3">3 </span>You have thrown me right into the deep—the heart of the sea; and a flood surrounds me. All your waves are crashing over me.</p>
<p class="q1">
 <span class="V" id="C2V4">4 </span>And I said,  ‘I have been driven out of your sight however I will look again towards your holy temple.’</p>
<p class="q1">
 <span class="V" id="C2V5">5 </span>I was up to my neck in the waters; it was deep all around me. There were reeds wrapped around my head.</p>
<p class="q1">
 <span class="V" id="C2V6">6 </span>I went down to the foundations of the mountains; barred from returning to the land. But you saved my life from the grave, Yahweh=GYHWH my God.</p>
<p class="q1">
 <span class="V" id="C2V7">7 </span>When my life was draining away from me, I remembered you, Yahweh, and my prayer reached you in your holy temple.</p>
<p class="q1">
 <span class="V" id="C2V8">8 </span>Those who worship lifeless gods abandon their allegiance to you.</p>
<p class="q1">
 <span class="V" id="C2V9">9 </span>But I’ll speak out my gratitude as I sacrifice to you. I’ve vowed this and I’ll do it, because Yahweh=GYHWH is my rescuer.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C2V10">10 </span>Then Yahweh=GYHWH spoke to the fish and it vomitted Jonah=P up onto the land.</p>
<div class="rightBox"><p class="s1"><span class="CV">3:1</span> Jonah=P goes to Nineveh</p>
</div><!--rightBox-->
<p class="p">
 <span id="C3"></span><span class="C" id="C3V1">3</span>And Yahweh=GYHWH spoke to Jonah=P a second time saying, <span class="V" id="C3V2">2 </span>“Go now to the major city, Nineveh, and announce this declaration which I’ve told you.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C3V3">3 </span>So Jonah=P went directly to Nineveh. It was a large city, taking three days to travel across. <span class="V" id="C3V4">4 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Mat 12:41; Luk 11:32.">[ref]</span>Jonah=P went one day’s travel into the city and publicly announced, “Nineveh is going to be destroyed in forty days!”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C3V5">5 </span>The people of Nineveh believed in God and announced a time of fasting, and from the least to the most important people, they just wore sackcloth <span class="added">as a sign of contrition</span>.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C3V6">6 </span>The king of Nineveh also heard about it and he got down from his throne, took off his robe and put on sackcloth, then sat in a pile of ashes. <span class="V" id="C3V7">7 </span>And he had a statement written out and publicly read throughout Nineveh, saying, “The king and his advisors declare that people and livestock, be it herds or flocks, are prohibited from grazing or eating anything, and even from drinking water. <span class="V" id="C3V8">8 </span>Both people and livestock should just wear sacks, and they should use their strength to cry out to God and they should turn away from the evil and violent things they have been doing. <span class="V" id="C3V9">9 </span>And maybe God will turn and change his mind and stop his fierce anger, and maybe we won’t die.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C3V10">10 </span>And God saw their actions in turning away from their evil ways and he changed his mind about the destruction which he had said he would send to them and he didn’t proceed with it.</p>
<div class="rightBox"><p class="s1"><span class="CV">4:1</span> Jonah=P gets upset</p>
</div><!--rightBox-->
<p class="p">
 <span id="C4"></span><span class="C" id="C4V1">4</span>But Jonah=P was very upset and the situation made him angry. <span class="V" id="C4V2">2 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Exo 34:6.">[ref]</span>And he said to Yahweh, “Please Yahweh, wasn’t this what I said would happen when I was still in my own country? That’s why I fled to Tarshish the first time, because I knew that you are a caring forgiving god, who doesn’t get angry quickly; full of kindess and not wanting to cause distress. <span class="V" id="C4V3">3 </span><span class="xref" title="See also 1Ki 19:4.">[ref]</span>So therefore Yahweh, please kill me because I’d rather die than live like this.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V4">4 </span>But Yahweh=GYHWH said, “Do you think it’s right to be angry like that?”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V5">5 </span>And Jonah=P went outside the city to the east and made himself a shelter and sat there in the shade to see what would happen to the city. <span class="V" id="C4V6">6 </span>And Yahweh=GYHWH God commanded a plant and it grew up over Jonah=P to shade his head and to relieve him from his distress. Jonah=P was very pleased about the plant. <span class="V" id="C4V7">7 </span>Then at dawn the next day God commanded a grub and it attacked the plant which then shrivelled up. <span class="V" id="C4V8">8 </span>And when the sun came up, God sent a hot east wind and the sun beat on Jonah’s head. He became faint and asked for his life to end and said, “It’s better for me to die than to live.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V9">9 </span>And God said to Jonah, “Do you think it’s right to be angry about the plant?”</p>
<p class="p">And Jonah=P replied, “Yes, I’m angry enough to die!”
</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V10">10 </span>Then Yahweh=GYHWH said, “You felt sorry for the plant which you didn’t even plant or work for. It came up in a day and died again in a day <span class="V" id="C4V11">11 </span>So shouldn’t I feel sorry for the huge city of Nineveh which has so many people in it who don’t know right from wrong, over 120,000 people, not to mention all the livestock!”</p>
