<p>Note: This is still a very early look into the unfinished text
of the <em>Open English Translation</em> of the Bible.
Please double-check the text in advance before using in public.</p><p>Note: This <em>Readers' Version</em> is a translation
into contemporary English aimed at <i>the person on the street</i> who
hasn't necessarily been brought up with exposure to Biblical jargon and/or 500-year old English.
(It's designed to be used alongside the <em>Literal Version</em> which gives
the English reader a window into what's actually written in the original languages.
(See the <a href="../LiteralVersion/index.html#Intro">introduction</a> for more details—we
recommend that you read the introduction first if you're wanting to read and understand the <em>Literal Version</em>.)
Between the two versions you should be able to easily read the clear message of the text,
while at the same time being able to check for yourself if that's a fair translation
of what the original authors had inked onto their ancient manuscripts.)</p>
<p>Note that <span class="RVadded">greyed words</span> are words that the translators
consider were most probably in the mind of the writer, but as none of us can double-check

<p class="mt2">The account of Jesus’ ministry by</p>
<p class="mt1">John</p>
<div class="bookIntro"><p class="is1">Introduction</p>
<p class="is2">Author</p>
<p class="ip">This account about the works and teachings of Jesus was written by John, brother of James—both of them were in the small group of twelve close followers of Jesus that he selected as His apprentices and who accompanied him around as he taught. Out of them, John was the one that greatly loved Jesus, and his closeness gave him much of the insight that he includes with his description of Jesus’ actions and teaching. The two brothers were the sons of Zebedee, and they had all worked on Lake Galilee as fishermen.</p>
<p class="is2">This account</p>
<p class="ip">We place John’s account before the others because it begins with the eternal existence of Jesus the messiah. Not only is Jesus the godly messenger, he was also the creator who has now descended from heaven as a man. Omitting any mention of the baby Jesus, John does however tell us about John-the-Immerser who came before Jesus to prepare the people for the arrival of the promised messiah.</p>
<p class="ip">In chapters two to twelve it’s written how the various miracles that Jesus did showed that he was the promised messiah to offer life without ending to whoever would accept that he had been sent by God and trust in his teaching. Although there were indeed many who did believe in him, many others were unable to come to that point and ended up opposing Jesus at every turn.</p>
<p class="ip">In chapters thirteen to seventeen, the compassion of Jesus towards his followers is described. He also told them in advance of his impending brutal death.</p>
<p class="ip">In the final few chapters, we read about the arrest and judging of Jesus, his being fastened to a pole and giving up his spirit, his coming back to life, and how his followers saw him and spoke with him again during that period.</p>
<p class="ip">John is careful to explain how to receive life without ending by means of believing that Jesus came down from heaven and obeying his teaching. Jesus himself is the road, the truth, and the life.</p>

<p class="p">
 <span id="C1"></span><span class="C" id="C1V1">1 </span>In the beginning was the Message,<span class="fn" title="Note: TD: This passage is difficult to translate because the Message was also the Messenger—that is Jesus came not only to teach about getting saved, but also to become the actual way to be saved!">[fn]</span> and the Message was with God, and the Message was God. <span class="V" id="C1V2">2 </span>The Message was with God even at the creation. <span class="V" id="C1V3">3 </span>Everything came into existence through the Messenger<span class="fn" title="Note: Lit. him.">[fn]</span>—not even one thing came into existence apart from him. <span class="V" id="C1V4">4 </span>He holds Life, and that Life is the Light of humankind. <span class="V" id="C1V5">5 </span>And that Light is shining in the darkness, and darkness cannot overcome him.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V6">6 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Mat 3:1; Mrk 1:4; Luk 3:1-2.">[ref]</span>A man arrived who had been sent by God. His name was John. <span class="V" id="C1V7">7 </span>He came as a testimony to tell about the Light so that everyone would believe the Light. <span class="V" id="C1V8">8 </span>John himself wasn’t the Light—he was merely the announcer of the Light. <span class="V" id="C1V9">9 </span>The true Light which enlightens every person was coming into the world.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V10">10 </span>He was in the world and he’s the creator of the world, and yet the world didn’t even know Acts <span class="V" id="C1V11">11 </span>He came to his own chosen people, but they wouldn’t accept him. <span class="V" id="C1V12">12 </span>But whoever would accept him, whoever trusted in His authority, he gave them the right to become children of God. <span class="V" id="C1V13">13 </span>Not physical children and not coming from human actions, but children of God.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V14">14 </span>And the Messenger became a human and lived here among us and we saw his greatness—the greatness of an only child of the Father—full of grace and truth.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V15">15 </span>John explained about him and loudly told everyone, “This is the one I meant when I said, ‘There’s someone coming after me, yet who came before me, because he existed before I did!’ ”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V16">16 </span>Because he has so much, we all received grace and then even more grace. <span class="V" id="C1V17">17 </span>The commandments came to us through Moses, but grace and truth came to us through Jesus the messiah. <span class="V" id="C1V18">18 </span>No one has ever actually seen God, but the human son born from God the father, he was the one to explain God to us.</p>

<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V19">19 </span>John explained some of this when the Jewish leaders sent out priests and temple workers from Jerusalem to ask him, “Who are you?”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V20">20 </span>And he didn’t flinch from the truth and told them, “I am not the chosen messiah.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V21">21 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Mal 4:5; b Deu 18:15,18.">[ref]</span>So they asked him again, “Are you Elijah come back to life?”</p>
<p class="p">And he answered, “No, I’m not.”
</p>
<p class="p">They asked, “Are you the prophet?”
</p>
<p class="p">Again he answered, “No, I’m not.”
</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V22">22 </span>So they asked him, “Who are you then? We need to give an answer to the ones who sent us. How do you describe yourself?”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V23">23 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Isa 40:3 (LXX).">[ref]</span>So he said, “I am a voice shouting<span class="fn" title="Note: We’ve deliberately omitted putting a comma here, because it’s also possible that the comma should go after ‘wilderness’.">[fn]</span> in the wilderness smooth the path of the master, as the prophet Isaiah said.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V24">24 </span>Some of the ones sent out were members of the Pharisee party. <span class="V" id="C1V25">25 </span>These ones asked John, “So why are you immersing people then if you aren’t the messiah or Elijah or the prophet?”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V26">26 </span>He answered, “I’m immersing people in water, but somewhere here among us all there’s someone you don’t know—<span class="V" id="C1V27">27 </span>the one coming after me, and I’m not even good enough to untie his sandal straps!”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V28">28 </span>All this happened in Bethany on the east side of the Jordan River where John was immersing people.</p>
<div class="rightBox"><p class="s1"><span class="CV">1:29</span> Jesus gets publicly revealed</p>
</div><!--rightBox-->
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V29">29 </span>The next day John saw Jesus coming towards him, and said, “Hey! Here’s the sacrificial lamb of God who’s come to take away the sin of the world. <span class="V" id="C1V30">30 </span>This is the man I was talking about when I said, ‘There’s someone coming after me, yet who came before me, because he existed before I did.’ <span class="V" id="C1V31">31 </span>I didn’t know who he was but nevertheless I came and immersed people in water so that this man could be revealed to <span class="RVadded">all</span> Israel.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V32">32 </span>And John further explained, “I saw God’s spirit come down and settle on Acts <span class="V" id="C1V33">33 </span>I didn’t know which one was Him, but the one who sent me to immerse people in water said, ‘When you see the spirit coming down and settling on someone, he is the one who will immerse people with God’s holy spirit.’ <span class="V" id="C1V34">34 </span>And I have seen that, and so I can assure you that he is God’s son.”</p>
<div class="rightBox"><p class="s1"><span class="CV">1:35</span> Jesus gets a few followers</p>
</div><!--rightBox-->
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V35">35 </span>The next day, John was back there with two of his apprentices <span class="V" id="C1V36">36 </span>and noticing Jesus walking nearby he said, “Look! There’s the sacrificial lamb of God.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V37">37 </span>When his two apprentices heard him say that, they left him and followed Jesus. <span class="V" id="C1V38">38 </span>But Jesus turned and saw them following him, and asked them, “What are you two wanting?”</p>
<p class="p">And they said to him, “Teacher, where do you stay?”
</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V39">39 </span>Jesus replied, “Come and see.” So they went with him and saw where he lived, and they stayed there that night, because it was already after 4pm.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V40">40 </span>Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter was one of those two who heard John and then followed Jesus. <span class="V" id="C1V41">41 </span>As soon as he found his brother, he said to Simon, “We have found the messiah—God’s chosen one,” <span class="V" id="C1V42">42 </span>and led him to Jesus. When Jesus saw him, he said, “Ah, you are Simon John but from now on you’ll be called Simon Peter which means <i>stone</i>.”</p>
<div class="rightBox"><p class="s1"><span class="CV">1:43</span> Philip and Nathanael join the group</p>

<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V43">43 </span>The following day, Jesus wanted to go to Galilee. He found Philip and told him, “Follow me!” <span class="V" id="C1V44">44 </span>Philip was from the town of Bethsaida where Andrew and Peter lived. <span class="V" id="C1V45">45 </span>Philip then found Nathanael and told him, “We’ve found the one that Moses and the prophets wrote about in the Scriptures. He’s Jesus from Nazareth.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V46">46 </span>And Nathanael said, “Does anything good come from Nazareth?”</p>
<p class="p">So Philip answered, “Well, come and see.”
</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V47">47 </span>Jesus saw Nathanael approaching and said, “Ah, this is an honest Israeli.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V48">48 </span>But Nathanael queried him, “Where do you know me from?”</p>
<p class="p">And Jesus replied, “Actually I saw you under that fig tree before Philip had even called you.”
</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V49">49 </span>Nathanael exclaimed, “Great teacher! You <em>are</em> God’s son! you’re the king of Israel!”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V50">50 </span>Jesus responded, “So you believe this because I said that I had seen you under the fig tree. You’ll get to see much greater things than that!” <span class="V" id="C1V51">51 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Gen 28:12.">[ref]</span>And he continued, “Honestly, I’m telling all of you: you’ll be seeing the sky opened up and God’s messengers going and and coming down on me, mankind’s child.”</p>
<div class="rightBox"><p class="s1"><span class="CV">2:1</span> The wine miracle</p>
</div><!--rightBox-->
<p class="p">
 <span id="C2"></span><span class="C" id="C2V1">2 </span>On the Tuesday<span class="fn" title="Note: Or possibly, ‘Three days later’.">[fn]</span>, there was a wedding in Cana in Galilee, and Jesus’ mother was there. <span class="V" id="C2V2">2 </span>Jesus and his apprentices were also invited. <span class="V" id="C2V3">3 </span>When the wine ran out at the wedding, Jesus’ mother said to him, “They haven’t got any more wine.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C2V4">4 </span>Jesus answered, “What does that have to do with us, mother? It’s not yet the time for my ministry.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C2V5">5 </span>But his mother told the servants, “Just do whatever he tells you.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C2V6">6 </span>Now there were six empty stone water jars there that are used for Jewish purification ceremonies. (Each one could hold over 70 litres.) <span class="V" id="C2V7">7 </span>So Jesus told them to fill the jars with water, and they filled them up. <span class="V" id="C2V8">8 </span>Then he said, “Ok, now take a sample out and give it to the MC.” So they took some. <span class="V" id="C2V9">9 </span>And when the MC tasted the water that had now turned to wine (but he didn’t know where it had come from), he called the groom <span class="V" id="C2V10">10 </span>and exclaimed, “Most people supply the best wine at the beginning, and the cheaper stuff when people are a bit tipsy. But you’ve kept the best wine until last!”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C2V11">11 </span>This event in Cana, Galilee, was the first of the miracles that Jesus did and it revealed his greatness, and his followers believed that he was from God.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C2V12">12 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Mat 4:13.">[ref]</span>After that, Jesus and his mother and brothers and his followers travelled east to Capernaum, but they only stayed there a few days.</p>

 <span class="V" id="C2V13">13 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Exo 12:1-27.">[ref]</span>It was getting close to the time of the Jewish Feast of the Passover, and Jesus went down to Jerusalem. <span class="V" id="C2V14">14 </span>There in the temple, he discovered merchants selling cows and sheep and doves, and moneychangers sitting at their tables. <span class="V" id="C2V15">15 </span>Jesus formed some cords into a whip and drove the sheep and cows out of the temple grounds, and he overturned the tables—spilling the coins of the moneychangers onto the ground. <span class="V" id="C2V16">16 </span>He scolded the ones selling doves, saying, “Get them out of here. Don’t be making my father’s house into a market.” <span class="V" id="C2V17">17 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Psa 69:9.">[ref]</span>That reminded his followers of the scripture: “I’ll be filled with zeal for your temple.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C2V18">18 </span>Then the Jewish leaders responded, “Do a miracle to show that you have the authority to do these things.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C2V19">19 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Mat 26:61; 27:40; Mrk 14:58; 15:29.">[ref]</span>But Jesus answered, “Well, destroy this temple and I’ll raise<span class="fn" title="Note: We couldn’t easily use <em>rebuild</em> here because there’s a play on words—see verse 21.">[fn]</span> it again in three days.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C2V20">20 </span>The leaders smirked, “This temple took 46-years to build, and you’ll raise it again in three days?”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C2V21">21 </span>But Jesus had been meaning his own body when he was talking about the temple. <span class="V" id="C2V22">22 </span>In the future when he was actually raised from the dead, his followers remembered this statement, and they believed both the Hebrew scriptures and Jesus’ message.</p>

</div><!--rightBox-->
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C2V23">23 </span>And when Jesus was at the Passover Feast in Jerusalem, many believed in his authority because they saw the miracles that he was able to do. <span class="V" id="C2V24">24 </span>But Jesus never fully entrusted himself to them, because he knew what people are like. <span class="V" id="C2V25">25 </span>(He didn’t need anyone to tell him what people are like because he could see what any person was like on the inside.)</p>

 <span id="C3"></span><span class="C" id="C3V1">3 </span>One night a Jewish leader named Nicodemus who was a member of the Pharisee party <span class="V" id="C3V2">2 </span>came to Jesus and said, “Teacher, we know that God has sent you as a teacher, because no one could do these kinds of miracles if God wasn’t with him.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C3V3">3 </span>Jesus responded, “I’ll tell you frankly that no one can enter God’s kingdom unless he is reborn.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C3V4">4 </span>Nicodemus questioned, “How could an adult be reborn? A person can’t just return to their mother’s womb and then get born again!”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C3V5">5 </span>And Jesus continued, “Honestly, I’m telling you: unless a person is born from both water <em>and</em> the spirit, they can’t enter God’s kingdom. <span class="V" id="C3V6">6 </span>Someone that’s born from a body is flesh, but someone that’s born from God’s spirit is spiritual. <span class="V" id="C3V7">7 </span>So you shouldn’t be surprised that I told you that everyone needs to be reborn. <span class="V" id="C3V8">8 </span>The wind blows wherever it wants, and you hear its sound but you can’t actually see where it’s coming from and where it’s going. So too with everyone born from God’s spirit.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C3V9">9 </span>Nicodemus replied, “How can all this even happen?”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C3V10">10 </span>And Jesus answered, “you’re a Jewish teacher and yet you don’t know all this? <span class="V" id="C3V11">11 </span>It’s true that we just teach what we know, and explain what we’ve seen ourselves, but you people aren’t accepting our testimony. <span class="V" id="C3V12">12 </span>If I tell you all earthly things and you don’t believe them, how will you ever believe if I explain <em>heavenly</em> things? <span class="V" id="C3V13">13 </span>None of you have gone up into heaven, except that I, mankind’s child, have come down from heaven.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C3V14">14 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Num 21:9.">[ref]</span>“Just like Moses lifted up that <span class="RVadded">bronze</span> snake <span class="RVadded">on a pole</span> in the wilderness, it’s necessary for mankind’s child to be lifted up,<span class="fn" title="Note: lifted up / exalted: See https://bibleDifferences.net/2019/04/25/156-exulted">[fn]</span> <span class="V" id="C3V15">15 </span>so that everyone who believes in him won’t die, but will live forever.<span class="fn" title="Note: See http://bibleandtech.blogspot.com/2021/03/john-314-21-translation-and-commentary.html">[fn]</span></p>

 <span class="V" id="C3V22">22 </span>After this, Jesus and his followers went down to Judea, and stayed there and immersed some believers. <span class="V" id="C3V23">23 </span>John was also immersing people at Aenon near Salim because there was plenty of water there and people would come to get immersed. <span class="V" id="C3V24">24 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Mat 14:3; Mrk 6:17; Luk 3:19-20.">[ref]</span>(At this time, John had not yet been put in prison.) <span class="V" id="C3V25">25 </span>Then a debate about purification started between John’s followers and a religious leader.<span class="fn" title="Note: https://www.billmounce.com/monday-with-mounce/what-does-the-word-%E2%80%9Cjew%E2%80%9D-mean-you-john-3-25">[fn]</span> <span class="V" id="C3V26">26 </span>So they came to John and said, “Teacher, that man that came to you across the river and that you testified about, now <em>he’s</em> immersing people and so they’re all going to him.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C3V27">27 </span>John answered, “None of us get anything if it’s not being given from heaven. <span class="V" id="C3V28">28 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Jn 1:20.">[ref]</span>You yourselves know that I said that I’m not the messiah, but rather the one coming before him. <span class="V" id="C3V29">29 </span>It’s the groom that has the bride—the best man is happy because he sees that the groom is happy.

<p class="p">
 <span id="C4"></span><span class="C" id="C4V1">4 </span>When Jesus found out that the Pharisee party knew that he was gaining and immersing more followers than John had, <span class="V" id="C4V2">2 </span>(although actually it wasn’t Jesus himself that was immersing them, but his trainees were doing it), <span class="V" id="C4V3">3 </span>he left Judea and went back up to Galilee. <span class="V" id="C4V4">4 </span>On the way up, he decided to go through Samaria.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V5">5 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Gen 33:19; Josh 24:32.">[ref]</span>Because of that, they came to a town in Samaria called Sukar, which was near the place Joseph had inherited from his father Jacob, <span class="V" id="C4V6">6 </span>and Jacob’s well was there. Jesus was tired from all the walking and was sitting at the well around midday.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V7">7 </span>A woman came from the town to get water from the well, and Jesus asked her for a drink <span class="V" id="C4V8">8 </span>since his followers had gone into the town to buy some lunch.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V9">9 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Ist 4:1-5; Neh 4:1-2.">[ref]</span>The woman said to him, “you’re a Jew. How come you’re asking me for a drink when I’m from Samaria?” (Jews don’t normally associate with anyone from Samaria.)</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V10">10 </span>Jesus answered, “If you had recognised God’s gift and who it is who’s asking you for a drink, you would have asked me and I would have given you <em>living</em> water.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V11">11 </span>But the woman countered, “Sir, you don’t even have <span class="RVadded">rope and</span> a bucket to reach the water in the deep well. How then could you get living water? <span class="V" id="C4V12">12 </span>I doubt that you’re greater than our ancestor Jacob who made this well for us, and drank this water along with his children and his animals.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V13">13 </span>Jesus responded, “Everyone who drinks this water will get thirsty again, <span class="V" id="C4V14">14 </span>but whoever drinks the water that I give them will find a well springing up inside them—springing into eternal life.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V15">15 </span>The woman said, “Ok. Give me some of that water so that I won’t get thirsty and won’t have to keep coming out here to the well.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V16">16 </span>Jesus said, “First, go and get your husband and return here.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V17">17 </span>But she retorted, “I don’t have a husband!”</p>
<p class="p">And Jesus said, “True enough—indeed you don’t.
 <span class="V" id="C4V18">18 </span>You’ve had five husbands and you’re not married to the man you’re living with, so that was true.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V19">19 </span>The woman reacted, “Sir, I can see that you’re a prophet. <span class="V" id="C4V20">20 </span>Our ancestors worshipped on this mountain, but you Jews claim that people should only worship there in Jerusalem.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V21">21 </span>Then Jesus told her, “You need to believe that I was sent from God, woman, because a day is coming when everyone will be worshipping him neither on this mountain, nor in Jerusalem. <span class="V" id="C4V22">22 </span>You people in Samaria don’t even know who you worship, but we do, because people will be saved by means of us Jews. <span class="V" id="C4V23">23 </span>But a time is coming, starting even now, when the true worshippers will be worshipping the father in spirit and truth, because those are the ones that he is wanting to worship him. <span class="V" id="C4V24">24 </span>God is spirit, and the ones worshipping him must worship in spirit and total honesty.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V25">25 </span>The woman said, “I’m aware that the messiah is coming—the chosen one of God. Whenever he appears, he’ll teach us everything.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V26">26 </span>And Jesus responded, “I am the messiah. Yes, he’s speaking to you!”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V27">27 </span>After this, his followers arrived back, and they were astounded that he was speaking with a woman. However no one dared ask her, “What are you after?” Or to ask him, “Why are you talking with her?”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V28">28 </span>So the woman left her water jar there, and went back into the town where she told the people, <span class="V" id="C4V29">29 </span>“Come and see a man who knew as much about me as I know myself! He must be the messiah!” <span class="V" id="C4V30">30 </span>So they went out from the town to go and see Jesus.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V31">31 </span>Meanwhile, Jesus’ followers encouraged him, “Teacher, here, eat.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V32">32 </span>But he said, “I’ve had food to eat that you don’t know about.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V33">33 </span>This made his followers ask each other, “Did you see anyone bring him something to eat?”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V34">34 </span>And Jesus explained, “Obeying God who sent me is like food to me, and I plan to finish his work. <span class="V" id="C4V35">35 </span>Don’t you all have a saying about needing to wait four months for a harvest? But I’m telling you that you all should open your eyes and look at the fields, because they’re already colouring with the coming harvest. <span class="V" id="C4V36">36 </span>The harvester gets paid with a harvest that will last forever so that the ones who plant and the ones who harvest can all celebrate. <span class="V" id="C4V37">37 </span>There’s truth in the statement that one person plants and a different person harvests. <span class="V" id="C4V38">38 </span>I’ve sent you all out to harvest where you haven’t worked before—others did the groundwork and you benefit from their work.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V39">39 </span>And many people of Samaria came out of that town and believed that Jesus is God because the woman had told them that he knew everything about her. <span class="V" id="C4V40">40 </span>So when they all came, they asked him to stay in their town, and so they stayed on there for a couple of days.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V41">41 </span>And many more believed as a result of his teaching, <span class="V" id="C4V42">42 </span>so they told the woman, “We no longer believe just because of what you said, but now that we’ve heard him for ourselves, we can see that he really is the saviour of the world.”</p>

<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V43">43 </span>After his two days in Samaria, Jesus continued on up to Galilee. <span class="V" id="C4V44">44 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Mat 13:57; Mrk 6:4; Luk 4:24.">[ref]</span>He himself said that no prophet gets honoured in his own home town. <span class="V" id="C4V45">45 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Jn 2:23.">[ref]</span> When he got to Galilee, the people accepted him, having seen everything that he’d done at the feast in Jerusalem because they had also been there.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V46">46 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Jn 2:1-11.">[ref]</span>So he went again to Cana there in Galilee where he had made the water into wine. And there was a royal official there, whose son in Capernaum was ill. <span class="V" id="C4V47">47 </span>When the official heard that Jesus was coming up from Judea to Galilee, he went and asked him if he would come and heal his son who was dying. <span class="V" id="C4V48">48 </span>Jesus said to him, “You people won’t believe unless you see miracles and other marvels.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V49">49 </span>But the official begged him, “Sir, please come before my child dies.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V50">50 </span>Jesus responded, “Go back there and see. Your son will recover.”</p>
<p class="p">The man believed what Jesus had told him, and so he started off.
 <span class="V" id="C4V51">51 </span>On his way, his slaves met him and reported that the boy was alive and well.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V52">52 </span>So the official inquired what time it was that he got better, and they replied that the fever had subsided around 1pm. <span class="V" id="C4V53">53 </span>The father knew that that was the time when Jesus had told him that his son would recover, and as a result his whole household believed <span class="RVadded">that Jesus came from God</span>.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V54">54 </span>This was the second miracle that Jesus did after leaving Judea and going to Galilee.</p>

</div><!--rightBox-->
<p class="p">
 <span id="C5"></span><span class="C" id="C5V1">5 </span>After all this, there was another Jewish feast, so Jesus went down to Jerusalem. <span class="V" id="C5V2">2 </span>In Jerusalem at the Sheep Gate, there’s the Bethsaida pool that has five alcoves <span class="V" id="C5V3">3 </span>and a large number of sick, blind, lame, and paralysed people lie there in them. <span class="V" id="C5V4">4 </span>≈ <span class="V" id="C5V5">5 </span>One man had been there for thirty-eight years, <span class="V" id="C5V6">6 </span>and when Jesus noticed him and knew that he’d been there for so long, he asked, “Do you want to get better?”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C5V7">7 </span>The sick man answered, “Yes mister, but when the water starts moving, I don’t have a companion to lift me into the pool, so someone else always get there before me.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C5V8">8 </span>Then Jesus said, “Stand up and pick up your bedroll and start walking.” <span class="V" id="C5V9">9 </span>The man immediately stood up, picked up his gear, and started to walk.</p>
<p class="p">However, this was the weekly rest day.
 <span class="V" id="C5V10">10 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Neh 13:19; Jer 17:21.">[ref]</span>So the religious leaders said to the man, “Hey! It’s against the law for you to carry your bedding on the rest day!”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C5V11">11 </span>But the man answered, “The person who made me better told me to pick up my bedroll and start walking.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C5V12">12 </span>“Oh. Who was it that told you to take that stuff and start walking?”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C5V13">13 </span>But the man who had been healed didn’t even know who it was, because when a crowd had formed, Jesus had quickly left.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C5V14">14 </span>Later on, Jesus found the man in the temple and told him, “Look, you’re better now, so don’t sin because you don’t want anything worse to happen to you.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C5V15">15 </span>The man then went and told the leaders that it was Jesus who had made him better. <span class="V" id="C5V16">16 </span>As a result, the leaders started harassing Jesus because he had done this on a rest day. <span class="V" id="C5V17">17 </span>But Jesus just replied, “My father is working today, and so I’m also working.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C5V18">18 </span>Because of this, the leaders became determined that he must be put to death, not just because he broke the rules for the rest day, but especially because he was calling God his own father, thus making himself equal to God!</p>
<div class="rightBox"><p class="s1"><span class="CV">5:19</span> Authority over life is given to the son</p>
</div><!--rightBox-->
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C5V19">19 </span>So Jesus responded to them, “I want to tell you all something: The son can’t initiate anything by himself. He can only do what he sees his father doing, because whatever his father is doing, he also does things like that. <span class="V" id="C5V20">20 </span>You see, the father loves his son and shows him everything that he’s doing. In fact, he’ll be showing him even greater things than what he’s done already, so that you all will be amazed. <span class="V" id="C5V21">21 </span>Because the father brings the dead back to life, giving them new life, so also the son can give life to whoever he wants. <span class="V" id="C5V22">22 </span>The father won’t be judging anyone, but has already given that task to the son, <span class="V" id="C5V23">23 </span>so that the people might honour the son like they honour the father. But any who is not honouring the son, is also dishonouring the father who sent him.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C5V24">24 </span>“I assure you that whoever hears my message and believes that I was sent by God, will live forever and will not be condemned, but has moved from death into life. <span class="V" id="C5V25">25 </span>I can also assure you that a time is coming, and in fact is here already, when the dead will be hearing the voice of the son of God and that voice will bring them back to life. <span class="V" id="C5V26">26 </span>As the the father is the source of life, he gave the power of giving life to the son <span class="V" id="C5V27">27 </span>and gave him the authority to be the final judge, because he is mankind’s child. <span class="V" id="C5V28">28 </span>Don’t be surprised at this, because a time is coming when everyone in their graves will be hearing his voice, <span class="V" id="C5V29">29 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Dan 12:2.">[ref]</span>and the ones having done what is good will be given new life, and the ones having done what is evil will be condemned.</p>

<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C5V31">31 </span>“If I just testify about myself, my testimony would not be correct or even valid. <span class="V" id="C5V32">32 </span>But it’s another one that’s testifying about me, and I know that his testimony about me is true. <span class="V" id="C5V33">33 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Jn 1:19-27; 3:27-30.">[ref]</span>You sent people out to question John and his testimony was true. <span class="V" id="C5V34">34 </span>But I don’t even need testimony that comes from people, because I am teaching you how to be saved. <span class="V" id="C5V35">35 </span>John was a bright and shining light and you appreciated it for a short time. <span class="V" id="C5V36">36 </span>But I have a stronger testimony than John’s because the father has entrusted works to me to complete, and which I’m already doing and which clearly show that the father sent me here. <span class="V" id="C5V37">37 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Mat 3:17; Mrk 1:11; Luk 3:22.">[ref]</span>And since he sent me, he himself has testified about me.

<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C6V10">10 </span>But Jesus told them to get all the people to sit down as there was a large grassy area.

<p class="p">

<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C6V28">28 </span>Puzzled, they asked him, “What should we be doing if we want to do God’s work?”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C6V29">29 </span>He answered, “Doing God’s work is putting your trust in the one that He sent here.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C6V30">30 </span>“If so,” they said, “what miracle will you do for us to see so that we can believe in you? What can you do? <span class="V" id="C6V31">31 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Exo 16:4,15; Psa 78:24.">[ref]</span>Our ancestors ate the manna out in the wilderness, as Moses wrote, ‘He gave them bread from heaven to eat.’ ”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C6V32">32 </span>Jesus said to them, “Actually I can tell you that it wasn’t Moses who gave them bread from heaven, but my father gives you the real bread from heaven, <span class="V" id="C6V33">33 </span>because the bread of God is the one who came down from heaven and who gives life to the world.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C6V34">34 </span>So they requested, “Mister, always give us that bread.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C6V35">35 </span>But Jesus answered, “<em>I am</em> the bread that gives life—whoever comes to me will never hunger, and the one believing in me, will never be thirsty again. <span class="V" id="C6V36">36 </span>But as I said already, although you have seen me you refuse to believe me. <span class="V" id="C6V37">37 </span>Everyone that the Father gives to me will come to me, and I certainly won’t turn away anyone who comes to me, <span class="V" id="C6V38">38 </span>because I came down from heaven, not to do what I want, but to do what the one who sent me wants. <span class="V" id="C6V39">39 </span>And what He wants is for me to not lose any that he’s given to me, but to bring them back to life on the last day. <span class="V" id="C6V40">40 </span>My father wants everyone who watches me and believes in me to live forever, because I will bring them back to life on that last day.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C6V41">41 </span>This little speech made the religious leaders grumble about him because he had said that he was the food that came down from heaven, <span class="V" id="C6V42">42 </span>as they figured out, “This is Jesus the son of Joseph and so we know his parents. So how can he say that he come down from heaven?”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C6V43">43 </span>Jesus scolded them, “Don’t be grumbling to each other. <span class="V" id="C6V44">44 </span>No one can join me unless the Father who sent me attracts them, and then I’ll be bringing them back to life on the last day.” <span class="V" id="C6V45">45 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Isa 54:13.">[ref]</span>The prophets wrote that the people will be taught by God.

<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C6V52">52 </span>At this point, the religious leaders began to argue with each other, “How could this man give us his flesh to eat?”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C6V53">53 </span>So Jesus explained, “Indeed if you don’t eat my flesh and drink my blood, you aren’t truly alive! <span class="V" id="C6V54">54 </span>The person who eats my flesh and drinks my blood will gain eternal life—I will bring them back to life on the last day. <span class="V" id="C6V55">55 </span>For my flesh is the true food, and my blood is the true drink. <span class="V" id="C6V56">56 </span>Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood lives in me, and I will live in him. <span class="V" id="C6V57">57 </span>The father is alive and sent me here, and I am alive because of Him, so also the person who eats me will be alive because of me. <span class="V" id="C6V58">58 </span>Unlike your ancestors who ate that bread and then died, whoever eats this bread that came down from heaven will live through to the next age.”</p>

</div><!--rightBox-->
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C6V59">59 </span>Jesus taught all of this in the meeting hall there in Capernaum. <span class="V" id="C6V60">60 </span>But even many of Jesus followers who heard it said, “This is difficult teaching—it’s too hard to take.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C6V61">61 </span>But Jesus already knew inside that his followers were grumbling about this and asked them, “Do you find this offensive? <span class="V" id="C6V62">62 </span>What if you were to see mankind’s child ascending to where he came from? <span class="V" id="C6V63">63 </span>It’s the spirit that is the source of life, not the body. The concepts that I’ve taught you are all spiritual and life-giving. <span class="V" id="C6V64">64 </span>But there are some here who don’t believe me.” Actually, Jesus had already known from the beginning just who would believe and which person would betray him. <span class="V" id="C6V65">65 </span>So he said, “That’s why I told you that no one can come to me unless the Father has given them to me.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C6V66">66 </span>After this, many of his followers went back and no longer accompanied him around.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C6V67">67 </span>So Jesus said to the twelve, “Don’t you also want to leave?”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C6V68">68 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Mat 16:16; Mrk 8:29; Luk 9:20.">[ref]</span>Simon answered, “Master, if we went, who would we follow then? you’re the <span class="RVadded">only</span> one who teaches about living forever. <span class="V" id="C6V69">69 </span>We believe and know that you are the holy son of God.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C6V70">70 </span>Jesus responded, “Didn’t I choose all twelve of you myself? And yet one of you is a devil.” <span class="V" id="C6V71">71 </span>(He was talking about Judas, son of Simon Iscariot, because he was the one who would go on to betray him.)</p>

<p class="p">
 <span id="C7"></span><span class="C" id="C7V1">7 </span>After all this, Jesus travelled around Galilee. (He didn’t want to travel around Judea because the leaders there wanted to execute him.) <span class="V" id="C7V2">2 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Lev 23:34; Deu 16:13.">[ref]</span>As it was now getting close to the Jewish Feast with Tents, <span class="V" id="C7V3">3 </span>his brothers said to him, “You should leave this place and go down to Judea so that all your followers can see the miracles that you’re doing. <span class="V" id="C7V4">4 </span>You don’t do things out of the main stream if you want to become well-known. If you want to do miracles, show yourself to the wider world. <span class="V" id="C7V5">5 </span>(You see, not even Jesus’ own <span class="RVadded">half-</span>brothers believed <span class="RVadded">that he came from God</span>.)</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C7V6">6 </span>So Jesus responded, “Well, you guys can do that any time, but it’s not the right time for me yet. <span class="V" id="C7V7">7 </span>All the people won’t hate you guys, but they do hate me because I teach about the evil things they are doing. <span class="V" id="C7V8">8 </span>You all go down to Jerusalem ahead of me.

<div class="rightBox"><p class="s1"><span class="CV">7:10</span> Jesus starts teaching about authentic justice</p>
</div><!--rightBox-->
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C7V10">10 </span>But after his <span class="RVadded">half-</span>brothers had left to go down to Jerusalem, Jesus also went—not in the public limelight but just incognito so to speak. <span class="V" id="C7V11">11 </span>However at the celebrations, the Jewish religious leaders were searching for him, and were asking around where he was.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C7V12">12 </span>Even among the crowds there was a lot of quiet banter with some saying that Jesus is a good man and others complaining that he was misleading the people. <span class="V" id="C7V13">13 </span>Either way, no one was speaking out in public about him, because they were afraid of the reaction of the religious leaders.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C7V14">14 </span>Finally sometime in the middle of the celebrations, Jesus went into the temple and started teaching in there. <span class="V" id="C7V15">15 </span>Even the Jewish leaders were surprised, asking, “How can this man know so much when he hasn’t been trained as a teacher?”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C7V16">16 </span>Jesus himself responded, “My teaching doesn’t come from me, but from the one who sent me. <span class="V" id="C7V17">17 </span>If anyone wants to do God’s will, they’ll soon figure out whether my teaching comes from God, or if I’m just making it up myself. <span class="V" id="C7V18">18 </span>Any person who just teaches his own thoughts is just seeking their own advancement, but whoever wants to promote the one who sent them, this is authentic and there’s no hidden self-interest. <span class="V" id="C7V19">19 </span>Didn’t Moses write down God’s commandments for you, yet not a single one of you obeys them. Why are you wanting to execute me?”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C7V20">20 </span>“You must be demon-possessed,” said some in the crowd, “Who would be wanting to execute you.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C7V21">21 </span>Jesus responded, “I did one miracle and you were all amazed. <span class="V" id="C7V22">22 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Lev 12:3; b Gen 17:10.">[ref]</span>Moses gave you the commandment about circumcision (even though it actually came from before his time), but to obey this, you’ll even circumcise a baby boy on the Rest Day. <span class="V" id="C7V23">23 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Jn 5:9.">[ref]</span>So if a male can be circumcised on the Rest Day so that Moses’ commandments aren’t broken, they why did you get angry with me because I made a man healthy of the Rest Day? <span class="V" id="C7V24">24 </span>Don’t just judge things so you yourselves look good, but judge impartially, seeking the best for others.”</p>
<div class="rightBox"><p class="s1"><span class="CV">7:25</span> Could Jesus be the messiah?</p>
</div><!--rightBox-->
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C7V25">25 </span>After this, some of the locals from Jerusalem started asking, “Isn’t this the man they were wanting to execute? <span class="V" id="C7V26">26 </span>Here he is teaching in public, yet they’re not even confronting him. Perhaps the leaders know that this really is the messiah? <span class="V" id="C7V27">27 </span>But we even know where this man is from. Surely when the messiah comes, no one would know his family background.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C7V28">28 </span>So as Jesus continued teaching, he called out, “Indeed you all know me and my home and family. But I didn’t come here of my own accord, but the one who sent me here is truthful, even though you don’t even know him. <span class="V" id="C7V29">29 </span>I know him, because I came from him, indeed, he was the one who sent me here.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C7V30">30 </span>So now they really want to arrest him, but no one touched him because it was not yet the proper time. <span class="V" id="C7V31">31 </span>Many in the crowd did believe that he was from God, and they were saying, “When the messiah comes, would he do greater miracles than what we’ve seen this man do?”</p>

 <span class="V" id="C7V32">32 </span>The Pharisee party heard the crowd muttering about these things and sent out some of their servants along with the chief priests to go and arrest Jesus. <span class="V" id="C7V33">33 </span>So Jesus said, “I’ll only be with you all for a short while longer and then I’ll be going to the one who sent me. <span class="V" id="C7V34">34 </span>You’ll look for me but won’t be able to find me, and you aren’t able to go where I’ll be going.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C7V35">35 </span>The leaders wondered, “Where could he be going that we wouldn’t be able to find him? Will he go and live with the Jews living among the Greeks and start teaching the Greeks? <span class="V" id="C7V36">36 </span>And what does he mean about looking for him and not being able to find him, and not being able to go where he goes?”</p>

<p class="p">But some pointed out, “The messiah won’t come from Galilee.

 <span class="V" id="C8V40">40 </span>But instead you’re trying to find a way to have me killed—to kill the man who has spoken the truth to you—truth that I heard from God. Abraham never did that. <span class="V" id="C8V41">41 </span>you’re doing what your father wants you all do to.”</p>
<p class="p">But they shot back, “It’s not us who was conceived by a couple that weren’t even married! Anyway, we only have one father and that’s God.”
</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C8V42">42 </span>Again Jesus responded, “If God was your father, you all would be loving me because I came from God and for God.

The reason that you can’t stand listening to my message <span class="V" id="C8V44">44 </span>is because you come from your father, the devil, and you want to do what <em>your</em> father wants. But he was a murderer from the beginning, and doesn’t stick to the truth because there’s no truth in him. Whenever he tells lies, he’s speaking from his own nature, because he’s a liar and the source of lying. <span class="V" id="C8V45">45 </span>But because I’m speaking the truth, you don’t believe in me. <span class="V" id="C8V46">46 </span>Which of you can scold me for my sins?

 <span class="V" id="C8V52">52 </span>The Jews said, “Now we <em>know</em> that you have a demon!

<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C8V54">54 </span>Again Jesus answered, “If I praise myself, my praise is worthless, but it’s my father who praises me—the one who you say is your God <span class="V" id="C8V55">55 </span>although in fact you don’t even know him. But I have known him, and so I can’t say that I haven’t known him or I’d better a liar like all of you.

 <span id="C9"></span><span class="C" id="C9V1">9 </span>As Jesus was walking along, he saw a man who had been blind from birth <span class="V" id="C9V2">2 </span>and his followers asked him, “Honoured teacher, why was this man born blind? Was it because he himself sinned, or his parents?”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C9V3">3 </span>Jesus answered, “It was neither this man nor his parents who sinned, but it was so that God can work in him for others to see. <span class="V" id="C9V4">4 </span>As long as it’s daytime, we need to do what the one who sent us wants.

<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C9V8">8 </span>Then the neighbours of the man and others who had seen him earlier, knowing that he was a beggar asked, “Isn’t he the one who always sat and begged here?”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C9V9">9 </span>And indeed, some were saying, “Yes, this is him.” But others were saying, “No, but he looks quite similar.”</p>

 <span class="V" id="C9V11">11 </span>“A man named Jesus made a slurry” he said, “and spread it on my eyes and told me to go and wash at Siloam Pool. So I went and did it, and when I washed my eyes, I could see.”</p>
<p class="p">

<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C9V13">13 </span>Then they brought the man who had been blind to the Pharisees. <span class="V" id="C9V14">14 </span>Now, it had been the Rest Day when Jesus had made the slurry and enabled him to see, <span class="V" id="C9V15">15 </span>and because of this, some in the Pharisee party asked him how it was that he could see now. And he answered, “Well, he put a slurry on my eyes and when I washed them, I could see.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C9V16">16 </span>So some of them said, “Clearly that man is not from God because he doesn’t respect the Rest Day.”</p>
<p class="p">However others said, “But if he’s just a sinner, how could he do miracles like that?”
</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C9V17">17 </span>So they asked the man who had been blind, “Well, what do you have to say because it was your eyes that he opened?”</p>
<p class="p">“He must be a prophet,” the man said.
</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C9V18">18 </span>But some of the Jews weren’t even sure that he really had been blind and could now see, so they called for his parents <span class="V" id="C9V19">19 </span>and asked them, “You two say that this is your son and that he was born blind. If so, how come he can see now?”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C9V20">20 </span>His parents answered, “We know that he’s our son, and we know that he was born blind. <span class="V" id="C9V21">21 </span>But as for how come he can now see, we don’t know that. Nor do we know who opened up his eyes.

<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C9V24">24 </span>So the leaders summoned the man born blind a second time and commanded him, “Only praise God himself for this, because we know that that man is a sinner.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C9V25">25 </span>“Well, I don’t know whether or not he’s a sinner,” said the man. “All I know if that I used to be blind but now I can see.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C9V26">26 </span>They asked again, “What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C9V27">27 </span>And he answered, “I already told you that and you didn’t even listen. Why do you want to hear it all again? Do you all want to become his followers as well?”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C9V28">28 </span>Then they insulted him and said, “You might be a follower of that man, but we are followers of Moses. <span class="V" id="C9V29">29 </span>We know that God spoke to Moses, but we don’t even know where this other fellow is from.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C9V30">30 </span>The man responded, “Wow, that’s pretty amazing. This man opened up my eyes, and you teachers don’t even know where he’s from! <span class="V" id="C9V31">31 </span>We know that God doesn’t listen to sinners, but he listens to those who worship him and do what he wants. <span class="V" id="C9V32">32 </span>In all the centuries we never heard that a person could give sight to someone who was born blind. <span class="V" id="C9V33">33 </span>If this man isn’t from God, surely he wouldn’t be able to do that!”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C9V34">34 </span>They reacted, “You’re just an ignorant sinner, and you think you can teach <em>us</em>!” Then they had him thrown out the door.</p>

 <span class="V" id="C9V35">35 </span>Jesus heard that they had thrown out the man who could now see, and when he found him, he said, “Do you believe that mankind’s child <span class="RVadded">came from God</span>?”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C9V36">36 </span>And the man answered, “Mister, who is he so that I can believe in him?”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C9V37">37 </span>“You’ve seen him and heard him and he’s speaking to you right now,” said Jesus.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C9V38">38 </span>And the man responded, “I do believe, master.” Then he knelt down in front of Jesus.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C9V39">39 </span>Jesus said, “I came into this world to dispense judgement, so that the people who can’t see will be able to see, and so that the ones who can see will become blind.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C9V40">40 </span>The Pharisees with him heard that and asked, “Are you saying that we’re blind?”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C9V41">41 </span>“If you were blind,” Jesus replied, “you wouldn’t be sinning, but since you all declare that you can see, then your sin remains.”</p>

<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C10V19">19 </span>The Jewish religious leaders were again divided about Jesus’ teaching <span class="V" id="C10V20">20 </span>with many of them saying, “He’s got a demon,” and, “He’s stark raving mad—why are you all even listening to him!”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C10V21">21 </span>But others were saying, “He doesn’t sound like he’s demon-possessed. And how could a demon make a blind man see?”</p>

If you are the messiah, tell us clearly.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C10V25">25 </span>So Jesus answered, “I already told you all but you didn’t believe me.

<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C10V31">31 </span>Again the Jewish leaders picked up rocks to throw at him to kill him. <span class="V" id="C10V32">32 </span>But Jesus asked, “I showed you all many miracles from my father. Which miracle do you want to kill me for?”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C10V33">33 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Lev 24:16.">[ref]</span>They answered, “It’s not for any <em>good</em> deed that we think you deserve to die, but because you, a human, dishonour God by claiming to be him.”</p>

 <span class="V" id="C10V34">34 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Psa 82:6.">[ref]</span>Jesus answered, “Isn’t it written in your scriptures that God said, ‘You all are gods’?” <span class="V" id="C10V35">35 </span>Now the scriptures can’t be wrong, and if the ones who heard teaching from God were called gods, <span class="V" id="C10V36">36 </span>why are you telling the one that the father blessed and sent out into the world that I am insulting God because I said that I’m God’s son? <span class="V" id="C10V37">37 </span>If I’m not doing my father’s work, then you don’t need to believe that he sent me, <span class="V" id="C10V38">38 </span>but if I am doing his work, even if you don’t believe that he sent me, at least believe in what I do so that you all can know that the father is in me and I’m in the father.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C10V39">39 </span>That was enough that they tried yet again to arrest him, but he was able to get away from their influence.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C10V40">40 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Jn 1:28.">[ref]</span>Then Jesus crossed the Jordan river to the place where John had immersed the people, and he stayed there. <span class="V" id="C10V41">41 </span>Many people visited him there, and they were saying that even though John had never done even one miracle, on the other hand, everything that he had said about Jesus was true, <span class="V" id="C10V42">42 </span>and many people there believed that Jesus was from God.</p>

 <span id="C11"></span><span class="C" id="C11V1">11 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Luk 10:38-39.">[ref]</span>Now there was a man called Lazarus who lived in the village of Bethany along with his sisters Martha and Mary. <span class="V" id="C11V2">2 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Jn 12:3.">[ref]</span>(Mary was the one who <a href="#C12V3">later</a> poured fragrant oil over Jesus and wiped his feet with her hair.)

<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C11V4">4 </span>However, when Jesus got the message he said, “This sickness won’t end in death but in honour for God, so that his son will also be honoured because of it.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C11V5">5 </span>Now it was true that Jesus loved the three of them. <span class="V" id="C11V6">6 </span>Yet when he heard that Lazarus was sick, he stayed in the place where he was for two more days <span class="V" id="C11V7">7 </span>before he said to his followers, “It’s time to head down to Judea again.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C11V8">8 </span>But they double-checked, “Honoured teacher, the Judeans wanted to execute you, so do you really want to go back there again?”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C11V9">9 </span>And Jesus answered, “There are twelve hours of light in the day.

<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C11V12">12 </span>But his followers objected, “Master, <span class="RVadded">it’s good</span> if he’s sleeping because it helps with healing.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C11V13">13 </span>But Jesus had spoken about Lazarus’ death—not just normal sleep as they had thought. <span class="V" id="C11V14">14 </span>So Jesus told them plainly, “Lazarus is dead <span class="V" id="C11V15">15 </span>and I’m glad that I wasn’t there, because you all will benefit as your faith grows. Anyway, let’s get moving.”</p>

<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C11V20">20 </span>As soon as Martha heard that Jesus had arrived, she went out to meet him, but Mary stayed behind where she was sitting in the house. <span class="V" id="C11V21">21 </span>Martha cried, “Jesus, master.

 <span class="V" id="C11V28">28 </span>After saying this, Martha went and quietly called her sister, Mary, “The teacher is on his way and he wants to see you.” <span class="V" id="C11V29">29 </span>So Mary quickly stood up and went to find him. <span class="V" id="C11V30">30 </span>At that stage, Jesus hadn’t yet come into the village proper, but was still at the edge where Martha had met him. <span class="V" id="C11V31">31 </span>The Judean people who’d been sitting with Mary in sympathy there in the house, when they saw her get up quickly and go out, they assumed that she was going to the cemetary to weep there.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C11V32">32 </span>But when Mary found Jesus, she knelt at his feet and said, “Master, if you’d been here my brother wouldn’t have died.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C11V33">33 </span>Now when Jesus saw her weeping there, along with the others that had followed also weeping, he himself was quite affected and groaned inside, <span class="V" id="C11V34">34 </span>but he just asked, “Where has he been laid?”</p>
<p class="p">“Master, come and see,” they replied.
</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C11V35">35 </span>Then Jesus <span class="RVadded">broke down and</span> wept, <span class="V" id="C11V36">36 </span>which made the others comment, “See how much he cared about him.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C11V37">37 </span>But some of them mocked, “This is the man who could make a blind man see again. How come he wasn’t able to stop this man from dying!”</p>

<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C11V38">38 </span>So Jesus who was still holding back sobs, went to the cemetary. Lazarus’ body had been placed in a cave with a stone blocking it, <span class="V" id="C11V39">39 </span>and Jesus instructed them to take away the stone.</p>
<p class="p">Martha (the sister of the dead man) spoke up, “Master, the stink will be too bad because it’s already been four days.”
</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C11V40">40 </span>But Jesus responded, “Didn’t I tell you that if you would believe, then you would see God’s power?” <span class="V" id="C11V41">41 </span>So they took the stone away and Jesus looked upwards and said, “Father, I thank you that you listen to me. <span class="V" id="C11V42">42 </span>Actually I know that you always hear me, but I said that for the sake of these people so that they will believe that it was you who sent me here.” <span class="V" id="C11V43">43 </span>After saying that, he shouted, “Lazarus, come out!” <span class="V" id="C11V44">44 </span>Then the man who had died <span class="RVadded">slowly</span> shuffled out—still with linen strips wrapped around his hands and his feet, and a cloth wrapped around his face.</p>

 <span class="V" id="C11V45">45 </span>Because of that, many of the Judeans believed that Jesus was from God after having followed Mary and seeing what Jesus did. <span class="V" id="C11V46">46 </span>But others went and told the Pharisee party what Jesus had done. <span class="V" id="C11V47">47 </span>So the chief priests and the Pharisee party called a formal meeting and asked, “What should we do because this man is doing many miracles. <span class="V" id="C11V48">48 </span>If we allow him to continue like this, all the crowds will be believing he’s the messiah, and then the Romans will come and destroy both our temple and our governance.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C11V49">49 </span>But one of them, Caiaphas who was chief priest that year, spoke up, “You don’t know anything. <span class="V" id="C11V50">50 </span>Don’t you all realise that its better for all of us if one man dies so that the people and the nation won’t be destroyed?” <span class="V" id="C11V51">51 </span>He didn’t say this from his own thinking, but being chief priest that year, he was announcing God’s message that Jesus was going to die for the nation, <span class="V" id="C11V52">52 </span>and not only for this nation, but for all of God’s children scattered around the world to become united.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C11V53">53 </span>As a result, from that day on they decided that Jesus needed to be executed. <span class="V" id="C11V54">54 </span>Because of that, Jesus no longer walked around Judea in public, but went out to the town of Ephraim out in the wilderness and stayed there with his followers.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C11V55">55 </span>At that time, the Jewish Passover celebrations were approaching, and many people from the regions went to Jerusalem ahead of the celebrations to purify themselves. <span class="V" id="C11V56">56 </span>They were looking out for Jesus and as they stood around in the temple, asked each other, “What do you think?

<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C12V7">7 </span>But Jesus responded, “Let her continue. She has kept this for the time of my burial. <span class="V" id="C12V8">8 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Deu 15:11.">[ref]</span>You’ll always have poor people with you, but you won’t always have me here.”</p>

<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C12V14">14 </span>Now Jesus had found a young donkey and rode it just like it was written in the scriptures,</p>
<p class="q1">
 <span class="V" id="C12V15">15 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Zech 9:9.">[ref]</span>“Don’t be worried you children of Zion. Your king is coming mounted on a donkey’s foal.”</p>

 <span class="V" id="C12V16">16 </span>(Jesus’ apprentices didn’t realise all these things at the time, but it was later after Jesus was lifted up to heaven that they were reminded that these things had been written about him, and that they had happened to him.)</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C12V17">17 </span>People in the crowd were telling each other about how they’d been with Jesus when he’d called Lazarus out from the burial chamber and brought him back to life, <span class="V" id="C12V18">18 </span>So because of this, others also wanted to met Jesus when they heard that he’d done that miracle. <span class="V" id="C12V19">19 </span>So the Pharisees discussed this together, “We’re getting nowhere with this.

<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C12V23">23 </span>Now Jesus told them, “The time has come for mankind’s child to be honoured. <span class="V" id="C12V24">24 </span>I can assure you that unless a wheat seed drops into the ground and dies, it will stay just as it is, but if it dies, it’s able to produce a harvest. <span class="V" id="C12V25">25 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Mat 10:39; 16:25; Mrk 8:35; Luk 9:24; 17:33.">[ref]</span>Whoever loves their life will lose it, but the one hating their life in this world will stay alive forever. <span class="V" id="C12V26">26 </span>Anyone who wants to serve me needs to follow after me, so that wherever I am, my servant will be there also. Anyone who serves me will be honoured by the father.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C12V27">27 </span>Now, I’m very troubled. What else could I say other than, ‘Father, let me avoid what’s coming.’ But it was exactly this that I came for. <span class="V" id="C12V28">28 </span>Father, may your name and authority be honoured.”</p>
<p class="p">And a voice from the sky answered, “I’ve already brought honour to it and will do so again.”
</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C12V29">29 </span>This caused some in the crowd standing there to say that they’d heard thunder while others said that an angel must have spoken to Jesus.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C12V30">30 </span>Jesus responded, “That voice wasn’t for my sake, but for all of you. <span class="V" id="C12V31">31 </span>This world is about to be judged and its ruler will be thrown out, <span class="V" id="C12V32">32 </span>and when I’m lifted up<span class="fn" title="Note: lifted up / exalted: See https://bibleDifferences.net/2019/04/25/156-exulted">[fn]</span> from the earth, I will attract everyone towards me.” <span class="V" id="C12V33">33 </span>By saying this, he was indicating how he was going to die.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C12V34">34 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Psa 110:4; Isa 9:7; Eze 37:25; Dan 7:14.">[ref]</span>So the crowd queried him, “We heard from the scriptures that the messiah will stay until the end of the age so why do you say that mankind’s child will be lifted up. And who is this ‘mankind’s child’?”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C12V35">35 </span>Jesus answered them, “The light will be among you all for just a little bit longer, so get walking while you have the light so that you won’t have to deal with darkness. Anyone walking in the dark doesn’t know where they’re going. <span class="V" id="C12V36">36 </span>While you still have the light, believe in the light so that you will become children of light.”</p>
<p class="p">Jesus said these things and then after leaving them, he was hidden from them.

<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C12V37">37 </span>Even though Jesus had done so many miracles in front of the people, they didn’t believe that he was the messiah. <span class="V" id="C12V38">38 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Isa 53:1 (LXX).">[ref]</span>This fulfilled what the prophet Isaiah wrote,</p>

 <span class="V" id="C12V39">39 </span>Because of this, they weren’t able to believe, and again as Isaiah wrote,</p>

</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C12V41">41 </span>Isaiah wrote this because he saw his greatness and spoke concerning him. <span class="V" id="C12V42">42 </span>Likewise, many of the Jewish leaders believed that Jesus was the messiah, but they didn’t tell others because they didn’t want the Pharisee party to banish them from the services <span class="V" id="C12V43">43 </span>as they valued the praise of people more than praise from God.</p>
<div class="rightBox"><p class="s1"><span class="CV">12:44</span> It’s Jesus’ teachings that will judge the hearers</p>
</div><!--rightBox-->
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C12V44">44 </span>Then Jesus called out, “Anyone who believes that I came from God is not <span class="RVadded">just</span> believing in me, but <span class="RVadded">also</span> believing in the one who sent me, <span class="V" id="C12V45">45 </span>and anyone who watches me <span class="RVadded">working</span>, is watching the one who sent me. <span class="V" id="C12V46">46 </span>I came into this world as light so that anyone who believes in me won’t have the darkess residing in them. <span class="V" id="C12V47">47 </span>I won’t be judging anyone who hears my teaching and doesn’t obey it, because I didn’t come to judge the world but rather to save it. <span class="V" id="C12V48">48 </span>Whoever rejects me and doesn’t accept my teaching does have a judge though—it’s the message that I spoke that will judge them at the end of time <span class="V" id="C12V49">49 </span>because I wasn’t speaking from my own thoughts, but it was the father himself who sent me that told me what to say and what to teach. <span class="V" id="C12V50">50 </span>And I’m fully aware that <span class="RVadded">obeying</span> his commands leads to living forever.

<p class="p">
 <span id="C13"></span><span class="C" id="C13V1">13 </span>Even before the actual feast part of the Passover celebrations, Jesus knew that his time had come, when he would leave this world and <span class="RVadded">return</span> to the father. He loved his followers who were in the world right through to the end.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C13V2">2 </span>And now it was getting near time for the dinner and the devil had already put the idea into Judas Iscariot’s mind to hand Jesus over <span class="RVadded">to the authories</span>. <span class="V" id="C13V3">3 </span>Jesus knew that the father had given everything to him, putting it under his control, and he knew that he had come from God and would return to God. <span class="V" id="C13V4">4 </span>So he got up from the dinner <span class="RVadded">table</span>, changed out of his clothes, and wrapped a linen towel around himself. <span class="V" id="C13V5">5 </span>Then he put water into the wash bowl and started washing the feet of his apprentices, wiping them dry with the linen towel that was he was wearing wrapped around him. <span class="V" id="C13V6">6 </span>After he’d washed a few, he got to Simon Peter who asked him, “Master, are you going to wash my feet?”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C13V7">7 </span>And Jesus answered, “What I’m doing now you won’t really understand, but in the future you will.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C13V8">8 </span>Peter responded, “Well I’m never ever going to let you wash <em>my</em> feet!”</p>
<p class="p">“If I don’t wash them,” Jesus answered, “then you won’t be included in my <span class="RVadded">group</span>.”
</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C13V9">9 </span>“Well, if that’s so,” Peter said, “don’t just wash my feet but my hands and my head as well.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C13V10">10 </span>Jesus responded, “Any person who’s already washed <span class="RVadded">themselves</span> only needs to wash their feet now to be clean. And so you’re clean, but not every one of you.” <span class="V" id="C13V11">11 </span>He said this last bit because he already knew who was going to hand him over.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C13V12">12 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Luk 22:27.">[ref]</span>So when he’d finished washing their feet, he got dressed again and sat down and asked, “Do you know what I just did to you all? <span class="V" id="C13V13">13 </span>You call me teacher and master, and so you should, because I am. <span class="V" id="C13V14">14 </span>So if the master and teacher of you all washed your feet, then you also ought to wash each other’s feet. <span class="V" id="C13V15">15 </span>I have given this to you all as an example that you can also do to others. <span class="V" id="C13V16">16 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Mat 10:24; Luk 6:40; Jn 15:20.">[ref]</span>I can assure you that a slave isn’t greater than his master, and an ambassador isn’t greater than the <span class="RVadded">king</span> who sends him. <span class="V" id="C13V17">17 </span>If you can figure all this out and then do it, you will be blessed <span class="RVadded">by God</span>.</p>

<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C13V22">22 </span>This made his apprentices glance around at each other, puzzled about which one he was talking about. <span class="V" id="C13V23">23 </span>One of them that Jesus especially liked,<span class="fn" title="Note: This apprentice, unnamed here, is assumed to be the author of this account (being shy or modest).">[fn]</span> was leaning against him <span class="RVadded">at the table</span>. <span class="V" id="C13V24">24 </span>So Simon Peter nodded to him to find out who Jesus had been talking about, <span class="V" id="C13V25">25 </span>and he leaned back on Jesus and asked <span class="RVadded">quietly</span>, “Master, who is it?”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C13V26">26 </span>Jesus answered, “It’s the one I hand this piece of bread to after I’ve dipped it <span class="RVadded">in the sauce</span>.” Then after dipping his piece of bread, he gave it to Judas Iscariot. <span class="V" id="C13V27">27 </span>After accepting the piece of bread, Satan entered into him, and then Jesus told him, “What you’re about to do, do it soon.” <span class="V" id="C13V28">28 </span>But none of the others sitting around the table knew what Jesus meant. <span class="V" id="C13V29">29 </span>Some of them thought that since Judas held their purse, perhaps Jesus was getting him to buy something they needed for the feast, or to give something to the poor.</p>
<p class="p">

<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C18V28">28 </span>Then they led Jesus out from Caiaphas and towards the residence of the governor. It was now the early hours of the morning and as Jews, they didn’t enter the residence of the Roman governor so they wouldn’t become defiled and thus unable to eat the Passover meal. <span class="V" id="C18V29">29 </span>So Governor Pilate came outside to them and asked, “What charge are you all bringing against this man?”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C18V30">30 </span>They answered, “We wouldn’t have brought him to you if he hadn’t committed a serious crime.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C18V31">31 </span>So Pilate said, “You just take him and judge him yourselves according to your own laws.”</p>
<p class="p">But the Jewish leaders responded, “We don’t have permission to execute anyone.”
 <span class="V" id="C18V32">32 </span>(This happened to fulfil what Jesus had said<span class="xref" title="See also Jn 3:14; 12:32.">[ref]</span> about the way that he was going to die.)</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C18V33">33 </span>So Pilate went back into his governor’s residence and called for Jesus and asked him, “So you’re the king of the Jews?”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C18V34">34 </span>“Are you saying this yourself,” Jesus asked, “or did others say it about me?”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C18V35">35 </span>Pilate retorted, “Hoy! I’m not a Jew. It was your own people and the chief priests that handed you over to me. What have you done?”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C18V36">36 </span>“My kingdom is not in this world,” Jesus answered, “because if it was, my supporters would have fought so that I wouldn’t have been handed over to the Jewish leaders. But no, my kingdom isn’t from here.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C18V37">37 </span>And Pilate responded, “So you are a king then?”</p>
<p class="p">“You’re saying that I’m a king,” said Jesus, “and indeed I was born to be a king. I came into the world so that I could testify to the truth.”
</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C18V38">38 </span>“<span class="RVadded">Yeah.</span> What is truth?” said Pilate.</p>

<p class="p">After he’d said this, Pilate went back outside to the Jews and told them, “I can’t find anything that he’s guilty of.
 <span class="V" id="C18V39">39 </span>But you have a custom here that the governor can release one prisoner during the Passover. So would you like me to release the king of the Jews?”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C18V40">40 </span>But they all yelled back, “No, not this one. Release Barabbas.” (Barabbas was a robber.)</p>
<p class="p">
 <span id="C19"></span><span class="C" id="C19V1">19 </span>So Pilate took Jesus and had him flogged. <span class="V" id="C19V2">2 </span>Then the soldiers twisted some thorn branches together into a crown and put it on Jesus’ head, and they dressed him in a <span class="RVadded">royal</span> purple robe. <span class="V" id="C19V3">3 </span>They came up to him and said, “Greetings, you king of the Jews,” and then slapped him.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C19V4">4 </span>Then Pilate went back outside and said to the Jews, “Look here. I’m bringing him out to you so that you all can know that I didn’t find him guilty of anything.” <span class="V" id="C19V5">5 </span>So they led Jesus out wearing the thorny crown and the kingly robe, and Pilate said, “Look. Here’s the man.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C19V6">6 </span>Now when the chief priests and their supporters saw him, they yelled out, Execute him on a stake! Execute him on a stake!”</p>
<p class="p">Pilate answered, “Well you take him and execute him on a stake, because I haven’t found anything that he’s guilty of.”
</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C19V7">7 </span>The Jews responded, “We have a law and he should be executed according to that law because he said he was the son of God.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C19V8">8 </span>Now when Pilate heard that, he became more afraid. <span class="V" id="C19V9">9 </span>So he went back inside the residence and asked Jesus, “Where do you come from?”</p>
<p class="p">But Jesus didn’t answer him.
 <span class="V" id="C19V10">10 </span>So Pilate said, “Why don’t you answer me? Don’t you realise that I have the authority to release you and I also have the authority to have you executed on a stake?”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C19V11">11 </span>Now Jesus answered, “You have no authority over me, none at all, except what has been granted to you from above. Because of this, the sin of the person who handed me over to you is greater.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C19V12">12 </span>After hearing this, Pilate wanted to release him. But the Jews yelled out, “If you release that man, you’re no friend of Caesar. Everyone who claims to be a king is no friend of Caesar’s.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C19V13">13 </span>So now Pilate, having heard all this, brought Jesus outside <span class="RVadded">again</span>. Pilate sat down on the judge’s seat at a place called The Stone Pavement (and called Gabbatha in Hebrew). <span class="V" id="C19V14">14 </span>It was now about noon on the day when the Passover meal is prepared, and Pilate said to the Jews, “Look. Here’s your king.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C19V15">15 </span>They yelled back, “Take him away. Take him away. Execute him on a stake.”</p>
<p class="p">Pilate asked them, “You want me to have your king executed on a stake?”
</p>
<p class="p">“We don’t have any king other than Caesar,” the chief priests answered.
</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C19V16">16 </span>So Pilate handed Jesus over to them, and they took him away to be executed on a stake.</p>

<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C19V22">22 </span>However Pilate answered, “What I’ve written, I’ve written.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C19V23">23 </span>After the soldiers had fastened Jesus to the stake, they took his clothes and placed in four piles, one for each of them.

So they went ahead and did that.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C19V25">25 </span>Meanwhile a group of women had stayed standing near Jesus on the stake: his mother and his aunt, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary from Magdala. <span class="V" id="C19V26">26 </span>When Jesus saw his mother and also the intern that he loved standing nearby, he said to her, “Look, he’ll be your son.” <span class="V" id="C19V27">27 </span>And to the intern he said, “Look, she’ll be your mother.” And that intern took her into his own <span class="RVadded">home</span> from that time.</p>

 <span class="V" id="C19V28">28 </span>Having done this, Jesus knew that everything had been accomplished, and (in order for the scriptures<span class="xref" title="See also Psa 69:21; 22:15.">[ref]</span> to be fulfilled) said, “I’m thirsty.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C19V29">29 </span>There was a container lying there full of vinegary wine, so they placed a sponge on a hyssop stalk, soaked it in the wine, and held it up to his mouth. <span class="V" id="C19V30">30 </span>After Jesus had sucked some wine out, he said, “It is finished.” Then he bowed his head and gave up his spirit.</p>

 <span class="V" id="C19V31">31 </span>Now because it was the preparation day<span class="xref" title="See also Jn 19:14.">[ref]</span> for the coming Rest Day, the Jews didn’t want the bodies to remain on the stakes after dusk (because it was even a special Rest Day.)

 <span class="V" id="C20V30">30 </span>Jesus went on to do many other miracles in front of his trainees which aren’t recorded in this account. <span class="V" id="C20V31">31 </span>But what has been written here has been recorded so that you all might believe that Jesus is the messiah, God’s son, and then by believing, so that you might have <span class="RVadded">true</span> life through his power.</p>

</div><!--rightBox-->
<p class="p">
 <span id="C21"></span><span class="C" id="C21V1">21 </span>After all this, Jesus revealed himself again to his trainees at Lake Galilee. It happened like this: <span class="V" id="C21V2">2 </span>Simon Peter, Thomas nicknamed ‘Twin’, Nathanael from Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two other trainees had gathered together <span class="V" id="C21V3">3 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Luk 5:5.">[ref]</span>when Simon Petter said that he was going fishing and the others said that they’d join him.</p>
<p class="p">So they went off and boarded the boat, but they didn’t catch anything that night.
</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C21V4">4 </span>When the dawn was approaching, Jesus was standing there on the shore, but they didn’t know that it was him. <span class="V" id="C21V5">5 </span>Jesus called out, “Hey, young fellas. Don’t you have any fish?”</p>
<p class="p">“None.” they answered.
</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C21V6">6 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Luk 5:6.">[ref]</span>So he said, “Throw the net out over the right side of the boat and you’ll find some.” So they did it and they caught so many fish that the net was too heavy to pull back in.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C21V7">7 </span>Now the intern that Jesus loved said to Peter, “It’s the master!” When Simon Peter heard that, he put on his robe (because he didn’t have it on), and jumped overboard into the lake. <span class="V" id="C21V8">8 </span>The other trainees followed in the little boat dragging the net behind them because they were only about 100m out from the shore. <span class="V" id="C21V9">9 </span>When they went up the beach, they saw some bread there and a charcoal fire with fish cooking on it <span class="V" id="C21V10">10 </span>and Jesus told them, “Bring some of the fish that you just caught.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C21V11">11 </span>So Simon Peter went and dragged the net onto the beach. Amazingly it hadn’t torn even though it contained 153 large fish. <span class="V" id="C21V12">12 </span>Then Jesus said, “Now, come and have breakfast.” But none of the trainees dared to ask who he was, because they figured it must be the master. <span class="V" id="C21V13">13 </span>Jesus brought the bread to them and shared it around, and then likewise for the fish.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C21V14">14 </span>This was now the third time that Jesus had appeared to his trainees since he’d come back to life.</p>

<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C21V15">15 </span>While they were eating, Jesus asked Simon Peter, “Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these?”</p>
<p class="p">Peter answered, “Yes, master, you know that I love you.”
</p>
<p class="p">Jesus responded, “Feed my lambs.”
 <span class="V" id="C21V16">16 </span>Then he asked again, “Simon, son of John, do you love me?”</p>
<p class="p">Peter replied, “Yes, master, you know that I love you.”
</p>
<p class="p">Jesus responded, “Shepherd my sheep.”
 <span class="V" id="C21V17">17 </span>Then he asked a third time, “Simon, son of John, do you love me?”</p>
<p class="p">Peter was now upset that he had been asked a third time if he loved him, and he answered, “Master, you know everything.”
</p>
<p class="p">Jesus responded, “Feed my sheep.
 <span class="V" id="C21V18">18 </span>I can assure you that when you were younger, you dressed yourself and went wherever you wanted to go, but as you age, you’ll be stretching out your hands and others will dress you and will take you where you don’t want to go.” <span class="V" id="C21V19">19 </span>When he said this, Jesus was indicating how Peter would die honouring God, and he told Peter, “Keep following me.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C21V20">20 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Jn 13:25.">[ref]</span>When Peter turned around he saw the intern that Jesus loved was following them—the one who had leaned on Jesus’ chest during the supper and asked who the one was who would turn Jesus over. <span class="V" id="C21V21">21 </span>Noticing him, Peter asked Jesus, “Master, what about that one?”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C21V22">22 </span>But Jesus replied, “If I want him to stay alive until I come back, what would it matter to you? You just stay following me.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C21V23">23 </span>As a result of that, a rumour went around the others that that one would not die, but Jesus never said that. (He only said, “If I want him to stay alive until I come back, what would it matter to you?”)</p>

</div><!--rightBox-->
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C21V24">24 </span>This author is the intern that testifies about these things—the one who wrote this down and whose account is true. <span class="V" id="C21V25">25 </span>(There were also many other things that Jesus did, which if they were all written down then even the world itself wouldn’t have room for all the books that would need to be written.)</p>
