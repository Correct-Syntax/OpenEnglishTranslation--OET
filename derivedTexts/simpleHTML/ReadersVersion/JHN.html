<p>Note: This is still a very early look into the unfinished text
of the <em>Open English Translation</em> of the Bible.
Please double-check the text before using in public.</p><p>Note: This <em>Readers’ Version</em> is a translation
into contemporary English aimed at <i>the person on the street</i> who
hasn’t necessarily been brought up with exposure to Biblical jargon and/or King James English.
It’s designed to be used alongside the <em>Literal Version</em> which gives
the English reader a window into what’s actually written in the original languages.
(See the <a href="../LiteralVersion/index.html#Intro">introduction</a> for more details—we
recommend that you read the introduction first if you’re wanting to read and understand the <em>Literal Version</em>.)
Between the two versions you should be able to easily read the clear message of the text,
while at the same time being able to check for yourself if that’s a fair translation
of what the original authors had inked onto their ancient manuscripts.</p>
<p class="mt1">John</p>
<div class="bookIntro"><p class="is1">Introduction</p>
<p class="is2">Author</p>
<p class="ip">This account about the works and teachings of Jesus was written by John, brother of James--both of them were in the small group of twelve close followers of Jesus that he selected as His apprentices and who accompanied Him around as He taught. Out of them, John was the one that greatly loved Jesus, and his closeness gave him much of the insight that he includes with his description of Jesus’ actions and teaching. The two brothers were the sons of Zebedee, and they had all worked on the Lake of Galilee as fishermen.</p>
<p class="is2">This account</p>
<p class="ip">We place John’s account before the others because it begins with the eternal existence of Jesus the Messiah. Not only is Jesus the godly messenger, he was also the creator who has now descended from heaven as a man. Omitting any mention of the baby Jesus, John does however tell us about John the Immerser who came before Jesus to prepare the people for the arrival of the promised Messiah.</p>

</div><!--rightBox-->
<p class="p">
 <span id="C1"></span><span class="C" id="C1V1">1</span>In the beginning was the Messenger, and the Messenger was with God, and the Messenger was God. <span class="V" id="C1V2">2 </span>The Messenger was with God even at the creation. <span class="V" id="C1V3">3 </span>Everything came into existence through the Messenger—not even one thing came into existence apart from Him. <span class="V" id="C1V4">4 </span>He holds Life, and that Life is the Light of humankind. <span class="V" id="C1V5">5 </span>And that Light is shining in the darkness, and darkness cannot overcome Him.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V6">6 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Mat 3:1; Mrk 1:4; Luk 3:1-2.">[ref]</span>A man arrived who had been sent by God. His name was John. <span class="V" id="C1V7">7 </span>He came as a testimony to tell about the Light so that everyone would believe the Light. <span class="V" id="C1V8">8 </span>John himself wasn’t the Light—he was merely the announcer of the Light. <span class="V" id="C1V9">9 </span>The true Light which enlightens every person was coming into the world.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V10">10 </span>He was in the world and He was the creator of the world, and yet the world didn’t even know Him. <span class="V" id="C1V11">11 </span>He came to His own chosen people, but they wouldn’t accept Him. <span class="V" id="C1V12">12 </span>But whoever would accept Him, whoever trusted in His authority, He gave them the right to become children of God. <span class="V" id="C1V13">13 </span>Not physical children and not coming from human actions, but children of God.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V14">14 </span>And the Messenger became a human and lived here among us and we saw his greatness—the greatness of an only child of the Father—full of grace and truth.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V15">15 </span>John explained about him and loudly told everyone, “This is the one I meant when I said, ‘There’s someone coming after me, yet who came before me, because he existed before I did!’ ”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V16">16 </span>Because He has so much, we all received grace and then even more grace. <span class="V" id="C1V17">17 </span>The commandments came to us through Moses, but grace and truth came to us through Jesus the Messiah. <span class="V" id="C1V18">18 </span>No one has ever actually seen God, but the human son born from God the father, He was the one to explain God to us.</p>
<div class="rightBox"><p class="s1"><span class="CV">1:19</span> The interrogation of John the Immerser</p>
<p class="r">(<a href="MAT.html#C3V1">Mat. 3:1-12</a>; <a href="None.html#C1V1">Mar. 1:1-8</a>; <a href="LUK.html#C3V1">Luk. 3:1-18</a>)</p></div><!--rightBox-->
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V19">19 </span>John explained some of this when the Jewish leaders sent out priests and temple workers from Jerusalem to ask him, “Who are you?”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V20">20 </span>And he didn’t flinch from the truth and told them, “I am not the chosem Messiah.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V21">21 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Mal 4:5; b Deu 18:15,18.">[ref]</span>So they asked him again, “Are you Elijah come back to life?”</p>
<p class="p">And he answered, “No, I’m not.”
</p>
<p class="p">They asked, “Are you the prophet?”
</p>
<p class="p">Again he answered, “No, I’m not.”
</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V22">22 </span>So they asked him, “Who are you then? We need to give an answer to the ones who sent us. How do you describe yourself?”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V23">23 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Isa 40:3 (LXX).">[ref]</span>So he said, “I am a voice shouting in the wilderness smooth the path of the master, as the prophet Isaiah said.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V24">24 </span>Some of the ones sent out were members of the Pharisee sect. <span class="V" id="C1V25">25 </span>These ones asked John, “So why are you immersing people then if you aren’t the Messiah or Elijah or the prophet?”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V26">26 </span>He answered, “I’m immersing people in water, but someone here among us all there’s someone you don’t know— <span class="V" id="C1V27">27 </span>the one coming after me and I’m not even good enough to untie his sandal straps!”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V28">28 </span>All this happened in Bethania, on the east side of the Jordan River where John was immersing people.</p>
<div class="rightBox"><p class="s1"><span class="CV">1:29</span> Jesus gets publicly revealed</p>
</div><!--rightBox-->
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V29">29 </span>The next day John saw Jesus coming towards him, and said, “Hey! Here’s the sacrificial lamb of God who’s come to take away the sin of the world. <span class="V" id="C1V30">30 </span>This is the man I was talking about when I said, ‘There’s someone coming after me, yet who came before me, because he existed before I did.’ <span class="V" id="C1V31">31 </span>I didn’t know who he was but nevertheless I came and immersed people in water so that this man could be revealed to the country.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V32">32 </span>And John further explained, “I saw God’s spirit come down and settle on Him. <span class="V" id="C1V33">33 </span>I didn’t know which one was Him, but the one who sent me to immerse people in water said, ‘When you see the spirit coming down and settling on someone, He is the one who will immerse people with God’s holy spirit.’ <span class="V" id="C1V34">34 </span>And I have seen that, and so I can assure you that He is God’s son.”</p>
<div class="rightBox"><p class="s1"><span class="CV">1:35</span> Jesus gets a few followers</p>
</div><!--rightBox-->
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V35">35 </span>The next day, John was back there with two of his apprentices <span class="V" id="C1V36">36 </span>and noticing Jesus walking nearby he said, “Look! There’s the sacrificial lamb of God.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V37">37 </span>When his two apprentices heard him say that, they left him and followed Jesus. <span class="V" id="C1V38">38 </span>But Jesus turned and saw them following him, and asked them, “What are you two wanting?”</p>
<p class="p">And they said to him, “Teacher, where do you stay?”
</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V39">39 </span>Jesus replied, “Come and see.” So they went with Him and saw where he lived, and they stayed there that night, because it was already after 4pm.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V40">40 </span>Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter was one of those two who heard John and then followed Jesus. <span class="V" id="C1V41">41 </span>As soon as he found his brother, he said to Simon, “We have found the Messiah—God’s chosen one,” <span class="V" id="C1V42">42 </span>and led him to Jesus. When Jesus saw him, he said, “Ah, you are Simon John but from now on you’ll be called Simon Peter which means /it stone/it*.”</p>
<div class="rightBox"><p class="s1"><span class="CV">1:43</span> Philip and Nathanael join the group</p>
</div><!--rightBox-->
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V43">43 </span>The following day, Jesus wanted to go to Galilee. He found Philip and told him, “Follow me!” <span class="V" id="C1V44">44 </span>Philip was from the town of Bethsaida where Andrew and Peter lived. <span class="V" id="C1V45">45 </span>Philip then found Nathanael and told him, “We’ve found the one that Moses and the prophets wrote about in the Scriptures. He’s Jesus from Nazareth.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V46">46 </span>And Nathanael said, “Does anything good come from Nazareth?”</p>
<p class="p">So Philip answered, “Well, come and see.”
</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V47">47 </span>Jesus saw Nathanael approaching and said, “Ah, this is an honest Israeli.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V48">48 </span>But Nathanael queried him, “Where do you know me from?”</p>
<p class="p">And Jesus replied, “Actually I saw you under that fig tree before Philip had even called you.”
</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V49">49 </span>Nathanael exclaimed, “Great teacher! You <em>are</em> God’s son! You’re the king of Israel!”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V50">50 </span>Jesus responded, “So you believe this because I said that I had seen you under the fig tree. You’ll get to see much greater things than that!”  <span class="V" id="C1V51">51 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Gen 28:12.">[ref]</span>And he continued, “Honestly, I’m telling all of you:  you’ll be seeing the sky opened up and God’s messengers going and and coming down on me, the Son of Man.”</p>
<div class="rightBox"><p class="s1"><span class="CV">2:1</span> The wine miracle</p>
</div><!--rightBox-->
<p class="p">
 <span id="C2"></span><span class="C" id="C2V1">2</span>On the Tuesday, there was a wedding in Cana in Galilee, and Jesus’ mother was there. <span class="V" id="C2V2">2 </span>Jesus and his apprentices were also invited. <span class="V" id="C2V3">3 </span>When the wine ran out at the wedding, Jesus’ mother said to Him, “They haven’t got any more wine.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C2V4">4 </span>Jesus answered, “What does that have to do with us, mother? It’s not yet the time for my ministry.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C2V5">5 </span>But his mother told the servants, “Do whatever he tells you.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C2V6">6 </span>Now there were six empty stone water jars there that are used for Jewish purification ceremonies. (Each one could hold over 70 litres.) <span class="V" id="C2V7">7 </span>So Jesus told them to fill the jars with water, and they filled them up. <span class="V" id="C2V8">8 </span>Then he said, “Ok, now take a sample out and give it to the MC.” So they took some. <span class="V" id="C2V9">9 </span>And when the MC tasted the water that had now turned to wine (but he didn’t know where it had come from), he called the groom <span class="V" id="C2V10">10 </span>and exclaimed, “Most people supply the best wine at the beginning, and the cheaper stuff when people are a bit tipsy. But you’ve kept the best wine until last!”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C2V11">11 </span>This in Cana, Galilee, was the first of the miracles that Jesus did and it revealed his greatness, and his followers believed that he was from God.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C2V12">12 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Mat 4:13.">[ref]</span>After that, Jesus and his mother and brothers and his followers travelled east to Capernaum, but they only stayed there a few days.</p>

<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C2V13">13 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Exo 12:1-27.">[ref]</span>It was getting close to the time of the Jewish Feast of the PassOver, and Jesus went down to Jerusalem. <span class="V" id="C2V14">14 </span>There in the temple, he discovered merchants selling cows and sheep and doves, and moneychangers sitting at their tables. <span class="V" id="C2V15">15 </span>Jesus formed some cords into a whip and drove the sheep and cows out of the temple grounds, and he overturned the tables—spilling the coins of the moneychangers onto the ground. <span class="V" id="C2V16">16 </span>He scolded the ones selling doves, saying, “Get them out of here. Don’t be making my father’s house into a market.” <span class="V" id="C2V17">17 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Psa 69:9.">[ref]</span>That reminded his followers of the scripture: “I’ll be filled with zeal for your temple.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C2V18">18 </span>Then the Jewish leaders responded, “Do a miracle to show that you have the authority to do these things.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C2V19">19 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Mat 26:61; 27:40; Mrk 14:58; 15:29.">[ref]</span>But Jesus answered, “Well, destroy this temple and I’ll raise it again in three days.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C2V20">20 </span>The leaders smirked, “This temple took 46-years to build, and you’ll raise it again in three days?”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C2V21">21 </span>But Jesus had been meaning his own body when he was talking about the temple. <span class="V" id="C2V22">22 </span>In the future when he was actually raised from the dead, his followers remembered this statement, and they believed both the Hebrew scriptures and Jesus’ message.</p>

<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C2V23">23 </span>And when Jesus was at the Passover Feast in Jerusalem, many believed in his authority because they saw the miracles that he was able to do. <span class="V" id="C2V24">24 </span>But Jesus himself never fully entrusted himself to them, because he knew what humankind is like. <span class="V" id="C2V25">25 </span>(He didn’t need anyone to tell him what humankind is like because he could see what any person was like on the inside.)</p>

</div><!--rightBox-->
<p class="p">
 <span id="C3"></span><span class="C" id="C3V1">3</span>One night a Jewish leader named Nicodemus who was a member of the sect of the Pharisees <span class="V" id="C3V2">2 </span>came to Jesus and said,  “Teacher, we know that God has sent you as a teacher, because no one could do these kinds of miracles if God wasn’t with him.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C3V3">3 </span>Jesus responded,  “I’ll tell you frankly that no one can enter God’s kingdom unless he is reborn.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C3V4">4 </span>Nicodemus questioned,  “How could an old person be reborn? He can’t just return to his mother’s womb and then get born again!”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C3V5">5 </span>And Jesus continued,  “Honestly, I’m telling you: unless a person is born from both water and the spirit, they can’t enter God’s kingdom. <span class="V" id="C3V6">6 </span>Someone that’s born from a body is flesh, but someone that’s born from God’s spirit is spiritual. <span class="V" id="C3V7">7 </span>You shouldn’t be surprised that I told you that everyone needs to be reborn. <span class="V" id="C3V8">8 </span>The wind blows wherever it wants, and you hear its sound but you can’t actually see where it’s coming from and where it’s going. So too with everyone born from God’s spirit.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C3V9">9 </span>Nicodemus replied,  “How could all this happen?”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C3V10">10 </span>And Jesus answered,  “You’re a Jewish teacher and yet you don’t know all this? <span class="V" id="C3V11">11 </span>It’s true that we just teach what we know, and explain what we’ve seen ourselves, but you people aren’t accepting our testimony. <span class="V" id="C3V12">12 </span>If I tell you all earthly things and you don’t believe them, how will you ever believe if I explain heavenly things? <span class="V" id="C3V13">13 </span>None of you have gone up into heaven, except that I, the Son of Man, have come down from heaven.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C3V14">14 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Num 21:9.">[ref]</span>“Just like Moses lifted up that <span class="added">bronze</span> snake <span class="added">on a pole</span> in the wilderness, it’s necessary for the Son of Man to be lifted up, <span class="V" id="C3V15">15 </span>so that everyone who believes in Him won’t die, but will live forever.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C3V16">16 </span>“Because in the same way, God loves the people of the world enough to cause his only son to be born and to give him to the world, so that everyone who believes that will not die, but will live forever. <span class="V" id="C3V17">17 </span>God didn’t send his son here to condemn poeple, but rather to save them. <span class="V" id="C3V18">18 </span>The one who trusts in me will not be condemned. However, the one who doesn’t believe this has already been condemned because he rejected the authority of the only son that God has given birth to. <span class="V" id="C3V19">19 </span>And this is the verdict: that light has come into the word, but some people loved the darkness more than the light because they do evil things. <span class="V" id="C3V20">20 </span>Because everyone who does evil things hates the light, and doesn’t come to the light so that their actions won’t be exposed. <span class="V" id="C3V21">21 </span>but whoever does what is right and true comes toward the light so that their actions can be revealed as being done with God’s help.”</p>

<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C3V22">22 </span>After this, Jesus and his followers went down to Judea, and stayed there and immersed some believers. <span class="V" id="C3V23">23 </span>John was also immersing people at Aenon near Salim because there was plenty of water there and people would come to get immersed. <span class="V" id="C3V24">24 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Mat 14:3; Mrk 6:17; Luk 3:19-20.">[ref]</span>(At this time, John had not yet been put in prison.) <span class="V" id="C3V25">25 </span>Then a debate started about purification between John’s followers and a Jewish leader. <span class="V" id="C3V26">26 </span>So they came to John and said,  “Teacher, that man that came to you across the river and that you testified about, he’s now immersing people and so they’re all going to him.”</p>

</div><!--rightBox-->
<p class="p">
 <span id="C4"></span><span class="C" id="C4V1">4</span>When Jesus found out that the Pharisees knew that he was gaining and immersing more followers than John had, <span class="V" id="C4V2">2 </span>(although actually it wasn’t Jesus himself that was immersing them, but his disciples were doing it), <span class="V" id="C4V3">3 </span>he left Judea and went back up to Galilee. <span class="V" id="C4V4">4 </span>On the way, he decided to go through Samaria.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V5">5 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Gen 33:19; Josh 24:32.">[ref]</span>Because of that, they came to a town in Samaria called Sukar, which was near the place Joseph had inherited from his father Jacob, <span class="V" id="C4V6">6 </span>and Jacob’s well was there. Jesus was tired from all the walking and was sitting at the well around noon.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V7">7 </span>A woman came from the town to get water from the well, and Jesus asked her for a drink <span class="V" id="C4V8">8 </span>since his followers had gone into the town to buy some lunch.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V9">9 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Ist 4:1-5; Neh 4:1-2.">[ref]</span>The woman said to him, “You’re a Jew. How come you’re asking me for a drink when I’m from Samaria?” (Jews don’t normally associate with anyone from Samaria.)</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V10">10 </span>Jesus answered, “If you had recognised God’s gift and who it is who’s asking you for a drink, you would have asked me and I would have given you <em>living</em> water.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V11">11 </span>But the woman countered, “Sir, you don’t even have <span class="added">rope and</span> a bucket to reach the water in the deep well. How then could you get living water?” <span class="V" id="C4V12">12 </span>I doubt that you’re greater than our ancestor Jacob who made this well for us, and drank this water along with his children and his animals.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V13">13 </span>Jesus responded, “Everyone who drinks this water will get thirsty again, <span class="V" id="C4V14">14 </span>but whoever drinks the water that I give them will find a well springing up inside them—springing into eternal life.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V15">15 </span>The woman said, “Ok. Give me some of that water so that I won’t be thirsty and won’t have to keep coming out here to the well.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V16">16 </span>Jesus said, “First go and get your husband and return here.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V17">17 </span>But she retorted, “I don’t have a husband!”</p>
<p class="p">And Jesus said, “True enough—indeed you don’t.
 <span class="V" id="C4V18">18 </span>You’ve had five husbands and you’re not married to the <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">guy</span> man you’re living with, so that was true.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V19">19 </span>The woman reacted, “Sir, I can tell that you’re a prophet. <span class="V" id="C4V20">20 </span>Our ancestors worshipped on this mountain, but you Jews claim that people should only worship there in Jerusalem.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V21">21 </span>Then Jesus told her, “You need to believe that I’m from God, woman, because a day is coming when everyone will be worshipping him neither on this mountain, nor in Jerusalem. <span class="V" id="C4V22">22 </span>You people in Samaria don’t even know who you worship, but we do because people will be saved by means of the Jews. <span class="V" id="C4V23">23 </span>But a time is coming, starting even now, when the true worshippers will be worshipping the father in spirit and truth, because those are the ones that he is wanting to worship him. <span class="V" id="C4V24">24 </span>God is spirit, and the ones worshipping him must worship in spirit and totally honesty.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V25">25 </span>The woman said, “I’m aware that the Messiah is coming—the chosen one of God. Whenever he appears, he’ll teach us everything.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V26">26 </span>And Jesus responded, “I am the Messiah. Yes, he’s speaking to you!”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V27">27 </span>After this, his followers got back, and they were astounded that he was speaking with a woman. However no one dared ask her, “What are you after?” Or ask him, “Why are you talking with her?”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V28">28 </span>So the woman left her water jar there, and went back into the town. She told the people there, <span class="V" id="C4V29">29 </span>“Come and see a man who knew as much about me as I know myself! He must be the Messiah!” <span class="V" id="C4V30">30 </span>So they left the town and went out to see Jesus.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V31">31 </span>Meanwhile, Jesus’ followers encouraged him, “Teacher, here, eat.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V32">32 </span>But he said, “I’ve had food to eat that you don’t know about.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V33">33 </span>This made his followers ask each other, “Did you see anyone bring him something to eat?”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V34">34 </span>And Jesus explained, “Obeying God who sent me is like food to me, and I plan to finish his work.” <span class="V" id="C4V35">35 </span>Don’t you all have a saying about needing to wait four months for a harvest? But I’m telling you that you all should open your eyes and look at the fields, because they’re already colouring with the coming harvest. <span class="V" id="C4V36">36 </span>The harvester gets paid with a harvest that will last forever so that the ones who plant and the ones who harvest can all celebrate. <span class="V" id="C4V37">37 </span>There’s truth in the statement that one person plants and a different person harvests. <span class="V" id="C4V38">38 </span>I’ve sent you all out to harvest where you haven’t worked before—others did the groundwork and you benefit from their work.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V39">39 </span>And many people of Samaria came out of that town and believed that Jesus is God because the woman had told them that he knew everything she had done. <span class="V" id="C4V40">40 </span>So when they all came, they asked him to stay in their town, and so they stayed there for two days.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V41">41 </span>And many more believed as a result of his teaching, <span class="V" id="C4V42">42 </span>so they told the woman, “We no longer believe just because of what you said, but now that we’ve heard him for ourselves, we can see that he really is the saviour of the world.”</p>

<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V43">43 </span>After his two days in Samaria, Jesus continued up to Galilee. <span class="V" id="C4V44">44 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Mat 13:57; Mrk 6:4; Luk 4:24.">[ref]</span>He himself said that no prophet gets honoured in his own home town. <span class="V" id="C4V45">45 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Jn 2:23.">[ref]</span> When he got to Galilee, the people accepted him, having seen everything that he’d done at the feast in Jerusalem because they had also been there.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V46">46 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Jn 2:1-11.">[ref]</span>So he went again to Cana there in Galilee where he had made the water into wine. And there was a royal official there, whose son in Capernaum was ill. <span class="V" id="C4V47">47 </span>When the official heard that Jesus was coming up from Judea to Galilee, he went and asked him if he would come and heal his son who was dying. <span class="V" id="C4V48">48 </span>Jesus said to him, “You people won’t believe unless you see miracles and other marvels.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V49">49 </span>But the official begged him, “Sir, please come before my child dies.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V50">50 </span>Jesus responded, “Go there and see. Your son will recover.”</p>
<p class="p">The man believed what Jesus had told him, and so he started off.
 <span class="V" id="C4V51">51 </span>On his way, his slaves met him and reported that the boy was alive and well.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V52">52 </span>So the official inquired what time it was that he got better and they replied that the fever had subsided around 1pm. <span class="V" id="C4V53">53 </span>The father knew that that was the time when Jesus had told him that his son would recover, and as a result, his whole household believed.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V54">54 </span>This was the second miracle that Jesus did after leaving Judea and going to Galilee.</p>
<div class="rightBox"><p class="s1"><span class="CV">5:1</span> Jesus heals a man at the pool</p>
</div><!--rightBox-->
<p class="p">
 <span id="C5"></span><span class="C" id="C5V1">5</span>After all this, there was another Jewish feast, so Jesus went down to Jerusalem. <span class="V" id="C5V2">2 </span>In Jerusalem at the Sheep Gate, there’s the Bethsaida pool that has five alcoves <span class="V" id="C5V3">3 </span>and a large number of sick, blind, lame, and paralysed people lie there in them. <span class="V" id="C5V4">4 </span><span class="V" id="C5V5">5 </span>One man had been there for thirty-eight years, <span class="V" id="C5V6">6 </span>and when Jesus noticed him and knew that he’d been there for so long, he asked, “Do you want to get better?”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C5V7">7 </span>The sick man answered, “Yes sir, but when the water starts moving, I don’t have a companion to lift me into the pool, so someone else always get there before me.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C5V8">8 </span>Then Jesus said, “Stand up and pick up your things and start walking.” <span class="V" id="C5V9">9 </span>The man immediately stood up, picked up his gear, and started to walk.</p>
<p class="p">However, this was the weekly rest day.
 <span class="V" id="C5V10">10 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Neh 13:19; Jer 17:21.">[ref]</span>So the religious leaders said to the man, “Hey! It’s against the law for you to carry your bedding on the rest day!”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C5V11">11 </span>But the man answered, “The person who made me better told me to pick up my things and start walking.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C5V12">12 </span>“Oh. Who was it that told you to take that stuff and start walking?”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C5V13">13 </span>But the man who had been healed didn’t even know who it was, because when a crowd had formed, Jesus had quickly left.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C5V14">14 </span>Later on, Jesus found the man in the temple and told him, “Look, you’re better now. So don’t sin because you don’t want anything worse to happen to you.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C5V15">15 </span>The man then went and told the leaders that it was Jesus who had made him better. <span class="V" id="C5V16">16 </span>As a result, the leaders started harassing Jesus because he had done this on a rest day. <span class="V" id="C5V17">17 </span>But Jesus just replied, “My father is working today, and so I am also working.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C5V18">18 </span>Because of this, the leaders became determined that he must be put to death, not just because he broke the rules for the rest day, but especially because he was calling God his own father, thus making himself equal to God!</p>
<div class="rightBox"><p class="s1"><span class="CV">5:19</span> Authority over life is given to the Son</p>
</div><!--rightBox-->
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C5V19">19 </span>So Jesus responded to them, “I want to tell you all something: The son can’t initiate anything by himself. He can only do what he sees his father doing, because whatever his father is doing, he also does things like that. <span class="V" id="C5V20">20 </span>You see, the father loves his son and shows him everything that he’s doing. In fact, he’ll be showing him even greater things than what he’s done already, so that you all will be amazed. <span class="V" id="C5V21">21 </span>Because the father brings the dead back to life, giving them new life, so also the son can give life to whoever he wants. <span class="V" id="C5V22">22 </span>The father won’t be judging anyone, but has already given that task to the son, <span class="V" id="C5V23">23 </span>so that the people might honour the son like they honour the father. But any who is not honouring the son, is also dishonouring the father who sent him.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C5V24">24 </span>“I assure you that whoever hears my message and believes that I was sent by God, will live forever and will not be condemned, but has moved from death into life. <span class="V" id="C5V25">25 </span>I can also assure you that a time is coming, and in fact is here already,  when the dead will be hearing the voice of the son of God and that voice will bring them back to life. <span class="V" id="C5V26">26 </span>As the the father is the source of life, he gave the power of giving life to the son <span class="V" id="C5V27">27 </span>and gave him the authority to be the final judge, because he is the Son of Man. <span class="V" id="C5V28">28 </span>Don’t be surprised at this, because a time is coming when everyone in their graves will be hearing his voice, <span class="V" id="C5V29">29 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Dan 12:2.">[ref]</span>and the ones having done what is good will be given new life, and the ones having done what is evil will be condemned.</p>

 <span class="V" id="C5V30">30 </span>Jesus continued explaining to the religious leaders, “I don’t do anything in isolation. As I hear from him, only then do I judge and my judgement is correct and impartial because I’m not imposing my desires, but the desire of the one who sent me.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C5V31">31 </span>“If I just testify about myself, my testimony would not be correct or even valid. <span class="V" id="C5V32">32 </span>But it’s another one that’s testifying about me, and I know that his testimony about me is true. <span class="V" id="C5V33">33 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Jn 1:19-27; 3:27-30.">[ref]</span>You sent people out to question John and his testimony was true. <span class="V" id="C5V34">34 </span>But I don’t even need testimony that comes from people, because I am teaching you how to be saved. <span class="V" id="C5V35">35 </span>John was a bright and shining light and you appreciated it for a short time. <span class="V" id="C5V36">36 </span>But I have a stronger testimony that John’s because the father has entrusted works to me to complete, and which I’m already doing and which clearly show that the father sent me here. <span class="V" id="C5V37">37 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Mat 3:17; Mrk 1:11; Luk 3:22.">[ref]</span>And since he sent me, he himself has testified about me.

<p class="p">

<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C6V10">10 </span>But Jesus told them to get all the people to sit down as there was a large grassy area. So they all sat down—some five thousand men. <span class="V" id="C6V11">11 </span>Then he took the buns and gave thanks to God, and started passing around both the buns and the fish, and everyone ate as much as they wanted! <span class="V" id="C6V12">12 </span>Once everyone was full, Jesus got his apprentices to collect the left-over fragments so as not to waste anything. <span class="V" id="C6V13">13 </span>So they gathered the left-overs and filled twelve baskets with left-over bread.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C6V14">14 </span>The people who had witnessed this and other miracles said, “This really is the prophet that God promised to send!” <span class="V" id="C6V15">15 </span>But Jesus knew that they intended to come and grab him to announce him as their king, so he moved out and on up the hill.</p>

<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C6V22">22 </span>The next day, the crowd looked across the lake and saw that only one small boat had crossed, and they knew that only Jesus’ apprentices had boarded that boat and left, and not Jesus himself. <span class="V" id="C6V23">23 </span>Other boats came across from Tiberias near the place where they had eaten the bread after the Master had given thanks. <span class="V" id="C6V24">24 </span>So when all the people saw that Jesus wasn’t around and his apprentices had left, they went off looking for Jesus in Capernaum.</p>

 <span class="V" id="C6V35">35 </span>But Jesus answered, “I am the bread that gives life—whoever comes to me will never hunger, and the one believing in me, will never be thirsty again. <span class="V" id="C6V36">36 </span>But as I said already, although you have seen me you refuse to believe me. <span class="V" id="C6V37">37 </span>Everyone that the Father gives to me will come to me, and I certainly won’t turn away anyone who comes to me, <span class="V" id="C6V38">38 </span>because I came down from heaven, not to do what I want, but to do what the one who sent me wants. <span class="V" id="C6V39">39 </span>And what He wants me to not lose any that he’s given to me, but to bring them back to life on the last day. <span class="V" id="C6V40">40 </span>My father wants everyone who watches me and believes in me to live forever, because I will bring them back to life on that last day.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C6V41">41 </span>This little speech made the religious leaders grumble about him because he had said that he was the food that came down from heaven, <span class="V" id="C6V42">42 </span>as they figured out, “This is Jesus the some of Joseph and so we know his parents. So how can he say that he come down from heaven?”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C6V43">43 </span>Jesus scolded them, “Don’t be grumbling to each other. <span class="V" id="C6V44">44 </span>No one can join me unless the Father who sent me attracts them,and then I’ll be bringing them back to life on the last day.” <span class="V" id="C6V45">45 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Isa 54:13.">[ref]</span>The prophets wrote that the people will be taught by God. And everyone who’s heard and learned from the Father comes to me. <span class="V" id="C6V46">46 </span>Not that any person has seen the Father—only the one who came from God has seen Him. <span class="V" id="C6V47">47 </span>I tell you sincerely: the one who believes <span class="added">in me</span> will live forever. <span class="V" id="C6V48">48 </span>I am the bread that gives true life. <span class="V" id="C6V49">49 </span>Your ancestors ate manna in the wilderness, but they all went on to die. <span class="V" id="C6V50">50 </span>I am the bread that came down from heaven and whoever eats this will not die. <span class="V" id="C6V51">51 </span>I am the living bread that came down from heaven and if anyone eats this bread, he will live through to the next age.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C6V52">52 </span>At this point, the religious leaders began to argue with each other, “How could this man give us his flesh to eat?”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C6V53">53 </span>So Jesus explained, “Indeed if you don’t eat my flesh and drink my blood, you aren’t truly alive! <span class="V" id="C6V54">54 </span>The person who eats my flesh and drinks my blood will gain eternal life—I will bring them back to life on the last day. <span class="V" id="C6V55">55 </span>For my flesh is the true food, and my blood is the true drink. <span class="V" id="C6V56">56 </span>Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood lives in me, and I will live in him. <span class="V" id="C6V57">57 </span>The father is alive and sent me here, and I am alive because of Him, so also the person who eats me will be alive because of me. <span class="V" id="C6V58">58 </span>Unlike your ancestors who ate that bread and then died, whoever eats this bread that came down from heaven will live through to the next age.”</p>
<div class="rightBox"><p class="s1"><span class="CV">6:59</span> Many people find the teaching too difficult</p>
</div><!--rightBox-->
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C6V59">59 </span>Jesus taught all of this in the synagogue there in Capernaum. <span class="V" id="C6V60">60 </span>But even many of Jesus followers who heard it said, “This is difficult teaching—it’s too hard to take.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C6V61">61 </span>But Jesus already knew inside that his followers were grumbling about this and asked them, “Do you find this offensive? <span class="V" id="C6V62">62 </span>What if you were to see the Son of Man ascending to where he came from? <span class="V" id="C6V63">63 </span>It’s the spirit that is the source of life, not the body! The concepts that I’ve taught you are all spiritual and life-giving. <span class="V" id="C6V64">64 </span>But there are some here who don’t believe me.” Actually, Jesus had already known from the beginning just who would believe, and which person would betray him. <span class="V" id="C6V65">65 </span>So he said, “That’s why I told you that no one can come to me unless the Father has given them to me.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C6V66">66 </span>After this, many of his followers went back and no longer accompanied him around.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C6V67">67 </span>So Jesus said to the twelve, “Don’t you also want to leave?”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C6V68">68 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Mat 16:16; Mrk 8:29; Luk 9:20.">[ref]</span>Simon answered, “Master, if we went, who would we follow then? You’re the <span class="added">only</span> one who teaches about living forever. <span class="V" id="C6V69">69 </span>We believe and know that you are the holy son of God.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C6V70">70 </span>Jesus responded, “Didn’t I choose all twelve of you myself? And yet one of you is a devil.” <span class="V" id="C6V71">71 </span>(He was talking about Judas, son of Simon Iskariot, because he was the one who would go on to betray him.)</p>
