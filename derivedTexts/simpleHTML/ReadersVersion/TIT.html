<p class="rem">ESFM v0.5 TIT</p>
<p>Note: This is still a very early look into the unfinished text
of the <em>Open English Translation</em> of the Bible.
Please double-check the text in advance before using in public.</p><p>Note: This <em>Readers' Version</em> is a translation
into contemporary English aimed at <i>the person on the street</i> who
hasn't necessarily been brought up with exposure to Biblical jargon and/or 500-year old English.
(It's designed to be used alongside the <em>Literal Version</em> which gives
the English reader a window into what's actually written in the original languages.
(See the <a href="../LiteralVersion/index.html#Intro">introduction</a> for more details—we
recommend that you read the introduction first if you're wanting to read and understand the <em>Literal Version</em>.)
Between the two versions you should be able to easily read the clear message of the text,
while at the same time being able to check for yourself if that's a fair translation
of what the original authors had inked onto their ancient manuscripts.)</p>
<p>Note that <span class="RVadded">greyed words</span> are words that the translators
consider were most probably in the mind of the writer, but as none of us can double-check
with the original speakers or writers, the reader is free to disagree.
They are clearly marked because we have tried to be as honest / transparent as possible.</p>

<div class="bookIntro"><p class="is1">Introduction</p>
<p class="is2">The author</p>
<p class="ip">Paul</p>
<p class="is2">The recipient</p>
<p class="ip">Titus wasn’t a Jew and didn’t originally believe in God. However, in later times he became a believer and from there, he became a helper in Paul’s work. This letter was sent by Paul there to Titus in Crete where he had been left to look after a group of believers. (Crete is an island that was a part of Greece.)</p>
<p class="is2">This letter</p>
<p class="ip">There are three main things contained in this letter: Firstly Titus is reminded about what is appropriate behaviour for teachers of believers. It was important that he understand this because those from Crete had many undesirable customs and there were many teachers of false doctrines that would confuse believers.</p>
<p class="ip">Secondly Titus was advised Titus how to teach the various groups of believers there, including young men and slaves, along with older men and women. (Then those older women were to teach the younger women.)</p>
<p class="ip">Finally Paul advised Titus about how believers should live, including avoiding attacking others, arguing, and splitting the believers into opposing groups. Paul reminded Titus again to follow the teachings of Jesus the messiah and obey what he commanded us.</p>
<p class="ip">Paul wanted it to be known that it’s very important for believers to behave well (1:6; 2:7,14; 3:1,8-9,14) even though doing good things can’t earn their salvation (3:5).</p>

 <span class="V" id="C1V5">5 </span>The reason that I asked you to stay behind in Crete was so that you would find what needed to be reorganised and so that you would appoint elders in every city just as I had directed you. <span class="V" id="C1V6">6 </span><span class="xref" title="See also 1Tim 3:2-7.">[ref]</span>Each elder must have a clean record, be the husband of one wife, and have believing children who are not wild or disobedient. <span class="V" id="C1V7">7 </span>Any overseer <span class="RVadded">in the assembly</span> as a manager working for God must have a clean record, not be self-centred, not be quick to get angry, not addicted to wine, not a bully, and not greedy, <span class="V" id="C1V8">8 </span>but rather hospitable, someone who loves what is good, sensible, honest, loves God, and self-controlled. <span class="V" id="C1V9">9 </span>He must hold faithfully to the message that was taught, so that he will be effective in encouraging others with sound teaching and to be rebuking those who speak against the message.</p>

<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V10">10 </span>There’s plenty of people who don’t want to be told what to do, empty talkers and outright deceivers, especially those that push the letter of the law. <span class="V" id="C1V11">11 </span>These people need to be silenced because they mess up whole families when they teach them things that they shouldn’t—all for the sake of shameful game. <span class="V" id="C1V12">12 </span>One of their own prophets said that the people from Crete are liars, evil beasts, and lazy gluttons, <span class="V" id="C1V13">13 </span>and that’s right. For those reasons, you need to sternly tell them they’re wrong, so that they can become sound in their faith, <span class="V" id="C1V14">14 </span>and not pay attention to Jewish myths or human rules which turn people away from the truth. <span class="V" id="C1V15">15 </span>For someone who’s pure in their thinking, everything is pure to them, but for unbelievers and those who’ve strayed from the truth, nothing is pure because their minds and consciences have already been damaged—<span class="V" id="C1V16">16 </span>they say that they know God, but their actions show that they don’t, and so they’re detestable. They can no longer accept teaching so they’re unsuitable for any good work.</p>

</div><!--rightBox-->
<p class="p">
 <span id="C2"></span><span class="C" id="C2V1">2 </span>But you, <span class="RVadded">Titus</span> speak only what comes from sound teaching. <span class="V" id="C2V2">2 </span>Older men need to be sober, dignified, sensible, and sound in their faith, their love, and their endurance. <span class="V" id="C2V3">3 </span>Likewise older women need to honour God by their behaviour, not making false accusations, not addicted to a lot of wine. They should teaching what is good <span class="V" id="C2V4">4 </span>so that they can train the younger women to love their husbands and children, <span class="V" id="C2V5">5 </span>and to be sensible and pure, homemakers that do good for others, living under the authority of their husbands so that others don’t speak evil of God’s message because of them.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C2V6">6 </span>Also encourage younger men to be sensible. <span class="V" id="C2V7">7 </span>Be a good example in everything you do and in your teaching. Don’t be led astray, maintain your dignity, <span class="V" id="C2V8">8 </span>watch every word that comes out of your lips, stay above reproach—all this so that those who oppose us can be reached because there’s nothing bad they can say about us.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C2V9">9 </span>Slaves need to conform to their master’s commands, aiming to please. They shouldn’t speak against their masters <span class="V" id="C2V10">10 </span>or be pilfering from them, rather they should display their good faith so that their actions add to the teachings of God our saviour.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C2V11">11 </span>This is because God’s grace which offers salvation to all people has appeared <span class="V" id="C2V12">12 </span>and teaches us that when we distance ourselves from ungodliness and worldly lusts, we can live sensibly and justly and devoutly in the present age. <span class="V" id="C2V13">13 </span>Then we can look forward to the blessing of the majestic appearance of our great God and saviour, Jesus the messiah <span class="V" id="C2V14">14 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Psa 130:8; b Exo 19:5; Deu 4:20; 7:6; 14:2; 1Pe 2:9.">[ref]</span>who gave himself for us in order to redeem us from all lawlessness and to purify us into his chosen people, eager to do good things.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C2V15">15 </span>Teach these things as you encourage some and scold others, but don’t let anyone disrepect you.</p>

</div><!--rightBox-->
<p class="p">
 <span id="C3"></span><span class="C" id="C3V1">3 </span>Remind people to conform to their rulers and authorities, being obedient and ready to do anything that’s good. <span class="V" id="C3V2">2 </span>Don’t slander others, be peaceable. Don’t be strong-willed, but rather show gentleness to all people.  <span class="V" id="C3V3">3 </span>We were also foolish and stubborn at one time, straying from the good and giving in to various lusts and pleasures, being mean and envious, even full of hate and hating one another. <span class="V" id="C3V4">4 </span>But when God our saviour revealed his kindness and love for mankind, <span class="V" id="C3V5">5 </span>he saved us, not because of the ‘good deeds’ that we did, but out of his mercy. He regenerated us through washing and renewed us by <span class="RVadded">his</span> pure spirit <span class="V" id="C3V6">6 </span>which he lavishly poured on us through Jesus the messiah <span class="V" id="C3V7">7 </span>so that we might become heirs with the expectation of living forever, having been declared that we have no outstanding legal charges thanks to his grace. <span class="V" id="C3V8">8 </span>That statement can be trusted. I want you to confirm those things so that those who have believed in God will be leading in wanting to do good things. These things are good and benefit everyone.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C3V9">9 </span>But avoid foolish debates, arguments about ancestry, other strife, and quarrels about the commandments because they all achieve nothing and waste time. <span class="V" id="C3V10">10 </span>Refuse to listen to a divisive person after you’ve given them two warnings <span class="V" id="C3V11">11 </span>knowing that such people condemn themselves by their corruption and sinful attitude.</p>
