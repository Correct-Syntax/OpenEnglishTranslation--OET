<p>Note: This is still a very early look into the unfinished text
of the <em>Open English Translation</em> of the Bible.
Please double-check the text in advance before using in public.</p><p>Note: This <em>Readers' Version</em> is a translation
into contemporary English aimed at <i>the person on the street</i> who
hasn't necessarily been brought up with exposure to Biblical jargon and/or 500-year old English.
(It's designed to be used alongside the <em>Literal Version</em> which gives
the English reader a window into what's actually written in the original languages.
(See the <a href="../LiteralVersion/index.html#Intro">introduction</a> for more details—we
recommend that you read the introduction first if you're wanting to read and understand the <em>Literal Version</em>.)
Between the two versions you should be able to easily read the clear message of the text,
while at the same time being able to check for yourself if that's a fair translation
of what the original authors had inked onto their ancient manuscripts.)</p>
<p>Note that <span class="RVadded">greyed words</span> are words that the translators
consider were most probably in the mind of the writer, but as none of us can double-check

<p class="mt2">Paul’s letter to the </p>
<p class="mt1">believers in Ephesus</p>
<div class="bookIntro"><p class="is1">Introduction</p>
<p class="is2">The author</p>
<p class="ip">This <span class="bk">Letter to the believers in Ephesus</span> was written by Paul from prison in Rome.</p>
<p class="is2">This letter</p>
<p class="ip">This letter wasn’t just written for the assembly of believers there in Ephesus, but also for other assemblies of believers.</p>
<p class="ip">Paul’s main theme is about God’s plan that “at the right time he will gather everything, whether in heaven or here on earth, for the messiah” (1:10).</p>
<p class="ip">In the first part of letter, he wrote about unity. Paul carefully explained about how God the father chooses his people, about forgiving and saving them from their sins through his son, Jesus the messiah.</p>
<p class="ip">In the second part of letter, Paul urges the reader that the believers need to be united in the messiah by means of their unity with each other.</p>
<p class="ip">Paul uses many allegories about the unity of people with God via the messiah: the believers are the body of the messiah, he is the head; it’s like a house, with the messiah as the foundation stone; the believers are also like a bride with the messiah as the groom.</p>
<p class="ip">It’s also explained here about the correct behaviour of couples, of parents and children, and of slaves and master. Then in concluding his letter, it’s explained about the armour that’s given to believers for them to use to stand against Satan’s attacks.</p>

<p class="p">
 <span id="C2"></span><span class="C" id="C2V1">2 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Col 2:13.">[ref]</span>You all were dead due to your disobedience and the <span class="RVadded">path of</span> sinning <span class="V" id="C2V2">2 </span>that you once walked along when you followed the trends of this world which <span class="RVadded">in turn</span> come from the ruler of the invisible powers—he’s the spirit that works in the children of disobedience. <span class="V" id="C2V3">3 </span>In the past, we also lived like them inside our fleshly lusts and then living out those desires and fantasies, and so we were children <span class="RVadded">deserving</span> strong anger just like everyone else.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C2V4">4 </span>But God was generous with his mercy because of the great love that he loved us with, <span class="V" id="C2V5">5 </span>so although we were dead as a result of our disobedience, he make us alive along with the messiah. Yes, we have been saved by <span class="RVadded">God’s</span> grace. <span class="V" id="C2V6">6 </span>And God lifted us up and sat us together with Jesus the messiah in the heavenly <span class="RVadded">domains</span> <span class="V" id="C2V7">7 </span>so that for the ages to come, he could display the overflowing riches of his grace through his kindess to us via Jesus the messiah. <span class="V" id="C2V8">8 </span>It’s <span class="RVadded">God’s</span> grace that allows you all to be saved through faith.

<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C2V11">11 </span>Because of that, don’t forget that you all were once fleshly unbelievers (nicknamed ‘the uncircumcized ones’ by circumsized Jews who mark the bodies <span class="RVadded">of their males</span> with human hands). <span class="V" id="C2V12">12 </span>At that time you were separated from the citizens of Israel and were strangers to the agreements involving <span class="RVadded">God’s</span> promise.

<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C2V13">13 </span>But now <span class="RVadded">thanks to</span> Jesus the messiah, you all who were once far <span class="RVadded">from God</span> have become close by means of the messiah’s blood. <span class="V" id="C2V14">14 </span>He is <span class="RVadded">the source</span> of peace <span class="RVadded">between Jews and non-Jews</span>, having broken the dividing wall that fenced them apart and making the two into one. He took the hostility onto himself, <span class="V" id="C2V15">15 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Col 2:14.">[ref]</span>having declared the <span class="RVadded">old </span> commandments to be now void so that Jews and non-Jews can now be peaceably united. <span class="V" id="C2V16">16 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Col 1:20.">[ref]</span>By <span class="RVadded">his death</span> on the pole, any hostility is destroyed and both groups now become just one body in God’s sight. <span class="V" id="C2V17">17 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Isa 57:19.">[ref]</span>When the messiah came, he announced the good message: peace to you all who were far <span class="RVadded">from God</span>, and peace also to the ones who were near, <span class="V" id="C2V18">18 </span>so now both groups have access to the father by means of one spirit through <span class="RVadded">the work of</span> the messiah.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C2V19">19 </span>As a result, you all are no longer strangers and foreigners, but fellow-citizens of the believers and part of God’s household <span class="V" id="C2V20">20 </span>which has been founded on the teaching of the ambassadors and prophets.

 <span id="C3"></span><span class="C" id="C3V1">3 </span>That’s the reason that I, Paul, am a prisoner <span class="RVadded">due to my serving</span> Jesus the messiah for you non-Jews. <span class="V" id="C3V2">2 </span>Certainly you have heard that God assigned me the task of passing on God’s grace to you. <span class="V" id="C3V3">3 </span>He revealed his incredible plan as I wrote briefly previously <span class="V" id="C3V4">4 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Col 1:26-27.">[ref]</span>and which you are all able to read to understand my insight into the incredible plan about the messiah. <span class="V" id="C3V5">5 </span>This plan wasn’t explained to humans in in previous generations but has now God’s spirit has revealed it to his worthy ambassadors and prophets. <span class="V" id="C3V6">6 </span>Now non-Jews can have the same inheritance and become members of the same body and can share in the same promise that was the positive message of Jesus the messiah.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C3V7">7 </span>I have become a servant of that message as a result of the gift of God’s grace that was given to me by means of the working of his power. <span class="V" id="C3V8">8 </span>Although I was the least of the ones dedicated to this message, I was given the grace to preach this positive message to the non-Jews, to tell them about the endless riches of the messiah <span class="V" id="C3V9">9 </span>and to enlighten everyone about the assignment of God’s incredible plan. God, the one who created everything, hid this plan away over the ages <span class="V" id="C3V10">10 </span>so that the wide-ranging wisdom of God could be revealed now through the church to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly realms. <span class="V" id="C3V11">11 </span>God did this according to his plan for the ages which he established in our master, Jesus the messiah. <span class="V" id="C3V12">12 </span>It’s through our faith in Jesus that we can have boldness and confident access <span class="RVadded">to God</span>. <span class="V" id="C3V13">13 </span>Because of that, I’m asking you not to become discouraged over my current difficulties as I <span class="RVadded">serve</span> you all, in fact you are honoured by them.</p>

<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C3V14">14 </span>That’s why I’m kneeling to <span class="RVadded">ask</span> the father <span class="V" id="C3V15">15 </span>(the one that every father in the heavens and on earth is named after) <span class="V" id="C3V16">16 </span>that he would cause you to be strengthened inside your minds by the power of his spirit and from the riches of his greatness. <span class="V" id="C3V17">17 </span>Through <span class="RVadded">your</span> faith, the messiah can live in your hearts so that love will become your root and foundation <span class="V" id="C3V18">18 </span>so that just like the dedicated ones, you all will also be strong enough to understand the width and length and height and depth of <span class="V" id="C3V19">19 </span>the messiah’s love, and to know that having this love exceeds having knowledge so that you all can be filled with God’s completeness.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C3V20">20-</span><span class="V" id="C3V21">21 </span>Now we offer praise to <span class="RVadded">God</span> in the church and for all the generations to come and to Jesus the messiah—<span class="RVadded">God</span> who, through the power that works in us, is able to do far more than we can ask for or even understand.

<p class="p">
 <span id="C4"></span><span class="C" id="C4V1">4 </span>Because of that, I, a prisoner for the master, am urging you all to walk worthily of the calling to which you were called <span class="V" id="C4V2">2 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Col 3:12-13.">[ref]</span>with all humility, gentleness, and patience, putting up with one another because of your love <span class="RVadded">for them</span>, <span class="V" id="C4V3">3 </span>being serious about keeping the unity of <span class="RVadded">God’s</span> spirit in the bond of peace. <span class="V" id="C4V4">4 </span>There is one body and one spirit, just as you all were called to one hope when you were called. <span class="V" id="C4V5">5 </span>There’s one master, one <span class="RVadded">system of</span> faith, one immersion, <span class="V" id="C4V6">6 </span>one God and father of all who is over all and through all and in all.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V7">7 </span>Yet each one of us has been given a measure of grace as a gift from the messiah, <span class="V" id="C4V8">8 </span>just as it was written,</p>
<p class="q1">“When he ascended to heaven,

<p class="m">
 <span class="V" id="C4V9">9 </span>Of course, he couldn’t ascend if he hadn’t first descended down to earth. <span class="V" id="C4V10">10 </span>So the one who descended is the very one who also ascended above all the heavens so that he could fill all locations. <span class="V" id="C4V11">11 </span>Then he gave some as ambassadors, some as prophets, some as announcers of the good message, some as pastors and teachers <span class="V" id="C4V12">12 </span>so as to complete the dedicated ones for the work of service—for building the body of the messiah <span class="V" id="C4V13">13 </span>until we can reach the unity of our faith and of our knowledge about God’s son—becoming mature people measured against the stature of the fullness of the messiah. <span class="V" id="C4V14">14 </span>Then we’ll no longer be <span class="RVadded">like</span> children <span class="RVadded">in our faith</span>, tossed around by waves and being blown by every wind of teaching used to trick us or by crafty people who scheme how to deceive us. <span class="V" id="C4V15">15 </span>Instead, by lovingly speaking the truth, we will grow up into every aspect of him—the messiah who is the head  <span class="V" id="C4V16">16 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Col 2:19.">[ref]</span>that integrates the entire body together and holds it together by every one of its joints.

<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C4V20">20 </span>But you all didn’t learn that about the messiah. <span class="V" id="C4V21">21 </span>If you had heard him and listened to his teaching, you would have heard the truth from Jesus: <span class="V" id="C4V22">22 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Col 3:9.">[ref]</span>that you reject the former conduct of the old corrupted you, those seductive desires, <span class="V" id="C4V23">23 </span>and allow the spirit driving your thoughts to be renewed <span class="V" id="C4V24">24 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Col 3:10; b Gen 1:26.">[ref]</span>and so to remodel yourself as a godly person created to obey God and follow the pure truth.</p>
