<p>Note: This is still a very early look into the unfinished text
of the <em>Open English Translation</em> of the Bible.
Please double-check the text in advance before using in public.</p><p>Note: This <em>Readers’ Version</em> is a translation
into contemporary English aimed at <i>the person on the street</i> who
hasn’t necessarily been brought up with exposure to Biblical jargon and/or 16<sup>th</sup> century English.
It’s designed to be used alongside the <em>Literal Version</em> which gives
the English reader a window into what’s actually written in the original languages.
(See the <a href="../LiteralVersion/index.html#Intro">introduction</a> for more details—we
recommend that you read the introduction first if you’re wanting to read and understand the <em>Literal Version</em>.)
Between the two versions you should be able to easily read the clear message of the text,
while at the same time being able to check for yourself if that’s a fair translation
of what the original authors had inked onto their ancient manuscripts.</p>
<p class="mt1">Mark</p>
<div class="bookIntro"><p class="is1">Introduction</p>
<p class="is2">Author</p>
<p class="ip">This account about the works and teachings of Jesus was written by Mark, the son of a Jewish family who lived in Jerusalem. His mother was named Mary (<a href="ACT.html#C12V12">Acts 12:12</a>).</p>
<p class="ip">Many people think he was John Mark, a cousin of Barnabas (<a href="COL.html#C4V10">Col. 4:10</a>) who accompanied Paul on his first long-distance trip to spread the good news about Jesus the messiah (<a href="ACT.html#C12V25">Acts 12:25</a>, <a href="ACT.html#C13V13">13:13</a>). We also know that Mark accompanied Peter (<a href="PE1.html#C5V13">1 Peter 5:13</a>), and some consider that it might have been Peter who narrated to Mark what Jesus had done and taught.</p>
<p class="is2">This account</p>
<p class="ip">This account seems to have been written for non-Jews, especially perhaps those familiar with Roman customs. So he didn’t use as much ink as Matthew or Luke explaining prophecies from the Jewish scriptures but he does, however, take time to explain Jewish customs to help non-Jewish readers.</p>
<p class="ip">Mark explains here that Jesus came to serve both God and the people, and he often refers to him as “humanity’s child”. We can see that especially in <a href="#C10V45">10:45</a>: “Even humanity’s child didn’t come to be served, but to serve others and to give his life and a ransom to set many people free.” Mark wants his readers to know that Jesus did incredible things, but especially focuses on his teaching. He confirms the power and authority of Jesus by telling about the miracles that he did, his healing of the sick, and his exorcism of demons.</p>
<p class="ip">The ending of this narrative is often disputed, and scholars are still <a href="https://textandcanon.org/a-case-for-the-longer-ending-of-mark">debating</a> about whether or not the longer ending (<a href="#C16V9">16:9-20</a>) is original. The <em>OET</em> includes the disputed longer ending, but displays it in a different font to indicate its debatable status.</p>
<p class="iot">Main components of Mark’s account</p>
<p class="io1">Preparation for and arrival of the messiah <a href="#C1V1">1:1-13</a></p>

 <span class="V" id="C1V4">4 </span>John turned up in the wilderness announcing that people should get immersed in water in order to show that their sins have been forgiven. <span class="V" id="C1V5">5 </span>And many from the Judean region and from the city of Jerusalem went out to hear him, and they confessed their sins and asked John to immerse them in the Jordan river.</p>

<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V9">9 </span>Then one day Jesus came from Nazareth in the Galilee region, and he was immersed in the Jordan river by John. <span class="V" id="C1V10">10 </span>As Jesus came up out of the water, he saw the sky being opened up, and God’s spirit coming down on him like a dove. <span class="V" id="C1V11">11 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Gen 22:2; Psa 2:7; Isa 42:1; Mat 3:17; 12:18; Mrk 9:7; Luk 3:22.">[ref]</span>And a voice came from the sky saying, “You are my son who I love and am pleased with.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V12">12 </span>And then the spirit sent him into the wilderness <span class="V" id="C1V13">13 </span>where he was tested by Satan for forty days. He was out there with the wild animals, but angels waited on him there.</p>

<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V14">14 </span>After John had been arrested, Jesus went back up to Galilee, announcing the good news from God <span class="V" id="C1V15">15 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Mat 3:2.">[ref]</span>saying, “The promised time is here, and God’s kingdom is now near, so turn from your sins and believe this good news.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V16">16 </span>And as he went around the lake of Galilee, Jesus saw Simon and his brother Andrew throwing a net into the lake because they were fishermen. <span class="V" id="C1V17">17 </span>And he said to them, “Come with me and I will be making you fishermen of people.” <span class="V" id="C1V18">18 </span>And so they left their fishing and went off with Jesus.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V19">19 </span>Then a bit further on he saw James Zebedee and his brother John with him in a boat getting their nets ready. <span class="V" id="C1V20">20 </span>Jesus called them and they too went off with him, leaving their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired workers.</p>
<div class="rightBox"><p class="s1"><span class="CV">1:21</span> Jesus drives out a demon</p>

<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V21">21 </span>They went on into Capernaum where he went into the meeting hall and began teaching as soon as the Sabbath started. <span class="V" id="C1V22">22 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Mat 7:28-29.">[ref]</span>The congregation was amazed at his teaching, because he taught with authority, not like the regular teachers there.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V23">23 </span>Then a demon-possessed man in the meeting hall suddenly yelled out, <span class="V" id="C1V24">24 </span>“What are we to you, Jesus of Nazareth? You’ve come to destroy us. I know that you’re God’s holy one.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V25">25 </span>But Jesus scolded it, “Keep quiet!”, and, “Come out of him!”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V26">26 </span>Then the demon threw the man into a convulsion, cried out loudly, and left him. <span class="V" id="C1V27">27 </span>Everyone was astounded and asked each other, “What just happened? We haven’t heard this before—he has authority to command demons, and they obey him!”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V28">28 </span>And the news about Jesus spread all over the entire region of Galilee.</p>

<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V29">29 </span>After leaving the meeting hall, Jesus went into the home of Simon and Andrew, along with James and John. <span class="V" id="C1V30">30 </span>Inside, Simon’s mother-in-law was lying down with a fever, and the others spoke to Jesus about her. <span class="V" id="C1V31">31 </span>He went up to her, took hold of her hand, and helped her up. Then the fever subsided and she prepared something for them to eat.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V32">32 </span>That evening when the sun set, the people brought all those who were sick or demon-possessed to Jesus. <span class="V" id="C1V33">33 </span>It seemed like the entire town had gathered there outside the front door. <span class="V" id="C1V34">34 </span>Jesus healed many who were sick from a range of diseases, and he commanded many demons to leave—not allowing them to speak because they knew that he was the messiah.</p>
<div class="rightBox"><p class="s1"><span class="CV">1:35</span> Jesus prays before going preaching</p>

<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V35">35 </span>In the small hours of the morning, Jesus got up and went out to a quiet place and prayed there. <span class="V" id="C1V36">36 </span>But Simon and the others came looking for him, <span class="V" id="C1V37">37 </span>and when they found him they said, “Everyone’s looking for you!”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V38">38 </span>And Jesus answered, “Well, we’ll be going into the other villages around here, so that I can also tell them. That’s what I came here for.” <span class="V" id="C1V39">39 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Mat 4:23; 9:35.">[ref]</span>Then he went preaching in all their meeting halls in Galilee and driving out demons.</p>

<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V40">40 </span>A man with leprosy came to Jesus asking him, “I know that you could heal me if you wanted to.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V41">41 </span>Jesus felt compassion for him, reached out his hand and touched him, and said, “Yes, I will. Get well.” <span class="V" id="C1V42">42 </span>Then immediately the leprosy disappeared and he was well again. <span class="V" id="C1V43">43 </span>So Jesus sent him away, but warned him: <span class="V" id="C1V44">44 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Lev 14:1-32.">[ref]</span>“Don’t talk to anyone—just go to the priest and show him that you’re well, and as a testimony of that, make the offering that Moses commanded.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C1V45">45 </span>But after the man left, he started telling lots of people and spreading the news—so much so that Jesus could no longer come into the town but had to stay out in quieter places, and people kept coming to him.</p>
<div class="rightBox"><p class="s1"><span class="CV">2:1</span> Jesus heals a paralysed man</p>

<p class="p">
 <span id="C2"></span><span class="C" id="C2V1">2</span>When Jesus came back to Capernaum after a few days, people soon heard that he was back in the house. <span class="V" id="C2V2">2 </span>And so many people turned up there that there wasn’t any room left—not even in the doorway. Inside, Jesus was explaining the Scriptures to them. <span class="V" id="C2V3">3 </span>Four men arrived, carrying a paralysed man to Jesus, <span class="V" id="C2V4">4 </span>but because of the crowd, they were unable to get close. So they climbed up onto the flat roof, made a hole through it, and lowered the paralysed man lying on a pallet. <span class="V" id="C2V5">5 </span>Jesus, observing their faith, said to the man, “Son, your sins are forgiven!”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C2V6">6 </span>But some of the religious teachers were sitting there, thinking to themselves, <span class="V" id="C2V7">7 </span>“Why’s he talking like that? He’s seriously insulting God. There’s only one who can forgive sins, and that’s God himself.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C2V8">8 </span>Then Jesus, knowing in his spirit that they are thinking like that, said to them, “Why are you thinking that to yourselves? <span class="V" id="C2V9">9 </span>Which is easier: to tell the paralysed man that his sins have been forgiven, or to tell him to pick up his bedding and walk?” <span class="V" id="C2V10">10 </span>But so you all can see that humanity’s child <em>does</em> have authority here on the earth to forgive sins, he turned and said to the paralysed man, <span class="V" id="C2V11">11 </span>“Listen. Get up, take your bedding, and go home!”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C2V12">12 </span>So the man stood up, and picked up his bedding, and went out of the house where everyone saw him and marvelled and praised God saying, “We’ve never seen anything happen like this before!”</p>

<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C2V13">13 </span>Jesus went out beside the lake where crowds of people kept coming to him and he taught them. <span class="V" id="C2V14">14 </span>And as he was passing by the tax office, he saw Levi Alphaeus sitting there and said to him, “Come along with me.” So Levi stood up and followed Jesus.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C2V15">15 </span>Jesus ended up having a meal at Levi’s place, and many other tax collectors and undesirables were sitting there also, along with Jesus’ followers, because by then many were following him around. <span class="V" id="C2V16">16 </span>And the teachers from the Pharisee party noticed that Jesus was eating beside undesirables and tax collectors. So they asked his followers, “How come he eats with tax collectors and other low-life?”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C2V17">17 </span>And overhearing them, Jesus said, “Healthy people don’t need a doctor—it’s the sick ones that do. I didn’t come here to help those who think they have no needs, but to call sinners.”</p>

<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C2V18">18 </span>Now the followers of John the Immerser and members of the Pharisees regularly fasted. So a small group came to Jesus and asked, “How come John’s followers and the Pharisee party fast regularly, yet your followers don’t?”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C2V19">19 </span>And Jesus answered, “Can the friends of the groom fast when they’re celebrating along with him? No, as long as he’s still there, they won’t be fasting. <span class="V" id="C2V20">20 </span>But in the future, the groom will be taken away from them, and <em>then</em> they’ll be fasting.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C2V21">21 </span>“No one sews a patch of new, unshrunken cloth onto an old garment, because the new patch will tear away from that old fabric and it will end up as a worse tear. <span class="V" id="C2V22">22 </span>And no one puts new wine into old wineskins, because the wine will burst the <span class="RVadded">already stretched</span> wineskins, and then both the wine and the wineskins will be destroyed.

 <span class="V" id="C2V23">23 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Deu 23:25.">[ref]</span>And it so happened that Jesus and his followers passed through some fields of grain on some days of rest. As they went through, they plucked off some heads of grain. <span class="V" id="C2V24">24 </span>And some members of the Pharisee party said, “It’s breaking the law to harvest grain on a rest day!”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C2V25">25 </span>And Jesus replied, “You’ve read yourselves what David did when him and his men were hungry. <span class="V" id="C2V26">26 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Lev 24:9.">[ref]</span>They went into God’s tent and ate the holy bread representing the presence of God.

 <span id="C3"></span><span class="C" id="C3V1">3</span>And again another time, Jesus went to the meeting hall and there was a man there with a curled-up hand. <span class="V" id="C3V2">2 </span>The religious leaders there were watching him closely to see if he would heal the man on the rest day, and then if he did, they would have a case against him. <span class="V" id="C3V3">3 </span>Then Jesus said to the man with the flawed hand, “Stand up there in the middle.” <span class="V" id="C3V4">4 </span>And he asked the leaders, “Is it allowable to do good on the rest day, or only to do evil? To save life, or to kill?” But they didn’t reply.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C3V5">5 </span>After angrily looking around at them, grieving at their complete lack of compassion, he said to the man, “Open up your hand!” <span class="V" id="C3V6">6 </span>The man stretched out his fingers, and his hand became totally normal. But the Pharisees quickly left, and meeting with King Herod’s supporters, they conspired to kill Jesus.</p>

 <span class="V" id="C3V7">7 </span>After that, Jesus withdrew towards the lake with his followers, and a huge crowd of people from the regions of both Galilee and down in Judea, <span class="V" id="C3V8">8 </span>along with others from Jerusalem, Idumea, from across the Jordan River, and from up near Tyre and Sidon.

 <span id="C5"></span><span class="C" id="C5V1">5</span>So they got <span class="RVadded">safely</span> to the region of Gerasenes on the other side of the lake. <span class="V" id="C5V2">2 </span>As Jesus climbed out of the boat, a demon-possessed man came out of the tombs to meet him. <span class="V" id="C5V3">3 </span>He lived in those tombs, and no one could tie him up, not even with chains, <span class="V" id="C5V4">4 </span>because he had often been tied up in the past with shackles and chains but had always pulled the chains apart and smashed the shackles, and no one was able to subdue him. <span class="V" id="C5V5">5 </span>All through the day and night, whether in the tombs or up in the hills, he was yelling out and hurting himself with stones.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C5V6">6 </span>So when he had seen Jesus in the distance, he ran and <span class="RVadded">as a sign of honour</span> fell to the ground in front of him. <span class="V" id="C5V7">7 </span>Then he called out very loudly, “What will happen between us, Jesus, the son of the highest God?

<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C5V9">9 </span>Jesus asked, “What’s your name?”</p>
<p class="p">The man answered, “My name is ‘Thousands’ because there’s many of us,”
 <span class="V" id="C5V10">10 </span>and he begged Jesus not to send them out of the country.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C5V11">11 </span>It just so happened that there was a large herd of pigs being fed on the hill nearby <span class="V" id="C5V12">12 </span>and they begged Jesus again saying, “Send us to the pigs so that we can enter them.” <span class="V" id="C5V13">13 </span>Jesus agreed to that, so the ungodly spirits came out of the man, went into the pigs, and the entire herd of some two thousand pigs rushed down the steep bank into the sea and were drowned.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C5V14">14 </span>The ones who had been feeding them rushed off and spread the news around in the city and the surrounding area. So the people hurried out to see what had happened. <span class="V" id="C5V15">15 </span>When they arrived where Jesus was, they saw the man who had been demon-possessed fully-clothed and sitting there in full control of his senses. They knew it was the man called ‘Thousands’ and they became frightened. <span class="V" id="C5V16">16 </span>Those who had seen it all happen described it all to the people—what had happened both to the demon-possessed man and to the pigs.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C5V17">17 </span>So then the people began asking Jesus to go away from their region.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C5V18">18 </span>As Jesus was climbing back into the boat, the man who had been demon-possessed wanted to go with him.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C5V19">19 </span>But Jesus wouldn’t let him and told him to head back home to his own people, and explain to them what the Master had done for him and how he had been merciful to him.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C5V20">20 </span>So he went away and shared with the people of the Ten Cities region what Jesus had done for him, and they were all amazed.</p>

<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C5V21">21 </span>When Jesus had crossed in the boat to the other side of the lake, a large crowd of people came out to the lake edge to see him. <span class="V" id="C5V22">22 </span>A religious leader named Jairus came out, and when he found Jesus he fell down at his feet <span class="V" id="C5V23">23 </span>and pleaded, “My young daughter is critical and just hanging on for you to come and touch her so that she can be healed and live.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C5V24">24 </span>So Jesus went off with Jairus. The large crowd followed also and many were getting pressed against Jesus.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C5V25">25 </span>Then a woman came who had been losing blood for twelve years <span class="V" id="C5V26">26 </span>and who had endured much under various doctors despite spending everything she had. After all that, she’d ended up even worse, <span class="V" id="C5V27">27 </span>but when she heard about what Jesus had been doing, she worked her way through the crowd to the back of Jesus and touched his clothes, <span class="V" id="C5V28">28 </span>because she had told herself, “If I could even just touch his clothes, I would be healed.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C5V29">29 </span>And immediately the bleeding stopped and she knew that she had been healed. <span class="V" id="C5V30">30 </span>Immediately also, Jesus knew that power had gone out of him, and he turned back towards the crowd and said, “Who touched my clothes?”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C5V31">31 </span>But his followers said, “You can see all the people that were pressing on you so why would you ask who touched you?”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C5V32">32 </span>But Jesus was still looking around to see who had done it. <span class="V" id="C5V33">33 </span>And the woman, scared and shaking because of what was happening, came and fell down in front of Jesus and told him the whole story. <span class="V" id="C5V34">34 </span>Jesus said, “Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace and full health.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C5V35">35 </span>While he was still speaking, messengers came from Jairus’ house to tell him, “Your daughter has died. Why bother the teacher any more?”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C5V36">36 </span>But Jesus overheard them telling this to the leader and told him, “Don’t be afraid—keep believing.” <span class="V" id="C5V37">37 </span>And Jesus didn’t allow anyone to accompany him other than Peter, and James and his brother, John. <span class="V" id="C5V38">38 </span>As they approached Jairus’ house, Jesus saw a big commotion with lots of crying and yelling going on. <span class="V" id="C5V39">39 </span>As he entered, he said, “Why are you all crying in distress? The child hasn’t died—she’s just sleeping!”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C5V40">40 </span>But they just ridiculed Jesus. So he sent them all outside, just taking the father and mother of the child, along with three with him. He went in where the girl was <span class="V" id="C5V41">41 </span>and taking her hand, he said, “Young woman, I tell you: get up!” <span class="V" id="C5V42">42 </span>Immediately she got up and walked around. And everyone marvelled at the amazing thing that had happened. (She was twelve years old.) <span class="V" id="C5V43">43 </span>Jesus repeatedly told them to keep this to themselves, and added that they should give her something to eat.</p>

 <span class="V" id="C6V21">21 </span>However, an opportunity came at Herod’s birthday celebration, when he threw a feast for his top officials and generals and for the leaders in Galilee. <span class="V" id="C6V22">22 </span>The daughter of Herodias came in and danced for them, and the king and his party guests all enjoyed it. So the king said to the young woman, “Just ask me for anything and I’ll give it to you.” <span class="V" id="C6V23">23 </span>And he made an oath, “Even if you asked for half of my kingdom, I’d give it to you!”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C6V24">24 </span>So she went out and asked her mother what she should ask for. Her mother told her that she should ask for John’s head.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C6V25">25 </span>So going back into the party, she said seriously to the king, “I would like the head of John the Immerser on a plate!”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C6V26">26 </span>The king was really upset with that, but because he had made loud oaths in front of all his guests, he couldn’t say no. <span class="V" id="C6V27">27 </span>So he ordered an executioner to go out and return with John’s head. He went off and beheaded him in the prison <span class="V" id="C6V28">28 </span>and brought the head into the party on a plate and gave it to the girl, and she gave it to her mother. <span class="V" id="C6V29">29 </span>When John’s followers heard about this, they came and fetched his body and put it into a tomb.</p>

<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C6V33">33 </span>But people from towns all around had seen them going and recognised who they were, so they ran around the lake on foot and got there ahead of them. <span class="V" id="C6V34">34 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Num 27:17; 1Ki 22:17; 2Ch 18:16; Eze 34:5; Mat 9:36.">[ref]</span>So when Jesus got out of the boat, he saw a big crowd and felt sorry for them because they seemed like sheep without a shepherd, so he started teaching them many things. <span class="V" id="C6V35">35 </span>Then, when it was already getting late, his apprentices came up and said, “This place is pretty isolated and it’s already late. <span class="V" id="C6V36">36 </span>Send these people off now so they can go to the nearby settlements and villages and buy themselves something to eat.”</p>

 <span class="V" id="C9V17">17 </span>One of the people answered, “Teacher, I brought my son here—he has a demon that prevents him from speaking. <span class="V" id="C9V18">18 </span>Whenever it takes hold of him, it attacks him and he starts foaming at the mouth and grating his teeth and his joints lock up.

<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C14V35">35 </span>He went ahead a little way where he knelt on the ground with his head down and prayed—asking if it was possible to avoid what was ahead of him. <span class="V" id="C14V36">36 </span>But he said, “Father, I know that you can do anything.

 <span class="V" id="C14V53">53 </span>The guards led Jesus away to the chief priest’s residence, and all the chief priests and the elders and the religious teachers gathered there also. <span class="V" id="C14V54">54 </span>Peter followed along from a distance and went in as far as the courtyard of the residence where he joined the servants who were sitting around the fire keeping warm. <span class="V" id="C14V55">55 </span>Inside, the chief priests and all the council were trying to establish a case against Jesus so he could be sentenced to death, but they weren’t coming up with anything. <span class="V" id="C14V56">56 </span>Several were making up charges against him, but none of the accusers’ stories agreed with each other.</p>

<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C14V60">60 </span>Nevertheless the chief priest in the middle of the council stood up and asked Jesus, “Aren’t you going to defend yourself? These men are accusing you of these things.”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C14V61">61 </span>But Jesus didn’t say anything. So the chief priest asked again, “Is it true that you’re the chosen one that God promised to send—the son of the blessed <span class="RVadded">God</span>?”</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C14V62">62 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Dan 7:13.">[ref]</span>Jesus replied, “I am. And you will all see humanity’s child sitting in the honoured postion by the powerful God and coming through the clouds in the sky.”</p>

<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C14V68">68 </span>But he denied it, “I don’t know him and I don’t know why you think I would!” And he moved away from the fire.</p>

 <span class="V" id="C15V35">35 </span>Some of the people standing nearby thought he was calling the prophet Elijah. <span class="V" id="C15V36">36 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Psa 69:21.">[ref]</span>One of them ran, and soaked a sponge in some sour wine, then put it on a stick and held it up for Jesus to drink, saying, “Hang on.

<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C15V37">37 </span>But just then Jesus uttered a loud cry and exhaled his last breath.</p>

<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C15V40">40 </span><span class="xref" title="See also Luk 8:2-3.">[ref]</span>Further back, there was also a group of women observing everything.

 <span class="V" id="C15V42">42 </span>As evening came, it was now the Preparation Day, i.e., the day before the Rest Day. <span class="V" id="C15V43">43 </span>Joseph (who’d come from the city of Arimathea and one who was waiting for the coming of God’s kingdom), a prominent council member, steeled himself up and went in to see the governor to get permission to transfer Jesus’ body. <span class="V" id="C15V44">44 </span>Governor Pilate didn’t think he’d be dead yet, so he called an army commander to find out if Jesus had indeed died. <span class="V" id="C15V45">45 </span>As soon as he found out, he gave Joseph permission. <span class="V" id="C15V46">46 </span>So Joseph <span class="RVadded">and his companions</span> went and bought some linen burial cloth and then, removing Jesus’ body from the pole, wrapped it in the cloth and placed it in a burial chamber that had been chiseled into a rockface. Then they rolled a rock across the opening. <span class="V" id="C15V47">47 </span>Others were watching and noted where the body had been laid, including Mary from Magdala and Mary the mother of Joses.</p>

 <span id="C16"></span><span class="C" id="C16V1">16</span>After the Rest Day was over, Mary from Magdala and Mary the mother of James and Salome, went and bought some traditional burial spices that evening to take to the burial chamber and place with the body. <span class="V" id="C16V2">2 </span>Then very early on Sunday morning they went to the chamber, arriving just as the sun was rising. <span class="V" id="C16V3">3 </span>But they realised that they didn’t have anyone with them to roll the rock away that was covering the entrance. <span class="V" id="C16V4">4 </span>However, when they looked they saw that the very large rock had already been rolled away. <span class="V" id="C16V5">5 </span>So they went on into the burial chamber and were toally stunned to find a young man dressed in white, sitting in there on the side.</p>
<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C16V6">6 </span>He assured them, “Don’t be surprised. I know you’re looking for Jesus from Nazareth, the one who was executed on a pole.

<p class="p">
 <span class="V" id="C16V8">8 </span>So they left the chamber and took off running, still stunned and shaking and too scared to stop and to talk to anyone.<p class="rem">It’s not certain whether or not the following longer ending of Mark was actually penned by him, or whether it was appended slightly later.
