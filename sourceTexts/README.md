# Open English Translation (OET) source texts

The open-licensed source texts belong to others.
We are translating from these texts
(or translating and adapting in the case of the OET-LV)
However, we copy (adapted forms of) the Hebrew and Greek source texts into here
so that we can detect and control changes to those source texts that
indicate that we need to update our OET files.
