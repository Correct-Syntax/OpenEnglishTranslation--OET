# Open English Translation (OET) source texts

The open-licensed source texts belong to others.
We are translating from these texts
(or translating and adapting in the case of the OET-LV)
However, we copy (adapted forms of) the Hebrew and Greek source texts into here
so that we can detect and control changes to those source texts that
indicate that we need to update our OET files.

## "Old Testament"

Open Scriptures Hebrew Bible (OSHB)

The [rawOSHB folder](rawOSHB/) contains three files converted from the 39 OSHB
XML files and hopefully containing all of the Scripture data.
(They do not contain any of the attribution or other introductory data --
to see that, go [here](https://github.com/Freely-Given-org/OS-morphhb/blob/master/wlc/Obad.xml) for example.)

## "New Testament"

Center for New Testament Restoration (CNTR) Statistical Restoration (SR) Greek New Testament (GNT)

Center for New Testament Restoration (CNTR) English Verifiable Literal Translation (VLT)
