\v 1 ¶ /The/_beginning ˱of˲_the gospel ˱of˲_\nd Jesus\nd* \nd Christ\nd*, Son ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*.
\v 2 ¶ As ˱it˲_/has_been/_written in - Isaiah the prophet: “behold, ˱I˲_/am/_sending_out the messenger ˱of˲_me before /the/_face ˱of˲_you, who /will_be/_preparing the way ˱of˲_you.”
\v 3 “/The/_voice ˱of˲_/a/_shouting \add one\add* in the desert: ‘Prepare the way ˱of˲_/the/_\nd Lord\nd*, /be/_making the paths ˱of˲_him straight.’”
\v 4 John, the \add one\add* baptizing in the desert Became, and proclaiming /a/_baptism ˱of˲_repentance for forgiveness ˱of˲_sins.
\v 5 And all the Judea region and all ˱of˲_the Jerusalemites /was/_going_out to him, and ˱they˲_/were_being/_baptized by him in the Jordan river, confessing the sins ˱of˲_them.
\v 6 And - John was /having/_dressed_in hairs ˱of˲_/a/_camel, and /a/_=> leather <=_belt around the waist ˱of˲_him, and eating locusts and wild honey.
\v 7 And ˱he˲_/was/_proclaiming saying, the \add one\add* mightier \add than\add* me “/Is/_coming after me, ˱of˲_whom ˱I˲_am not worthy, /having/_bent_down /to/_untie the strap ˱of˲_the sandals ˱of˲_him.
\v 8 I baptized you_all ˱with˲_water, but he /will_be/_baptizing you_all /the/_=> Holy <=_\nd Spirit\nd*.”
\v 9 ¶ And ˱it˲_became in those - days, \nd Jesus\nd* came from Nazareth - ˱of˲_Galilee, and ˱he˲_/was/_baptized in the Jordan by John.
\v 10 And immediately going_up from the water, ˱he˲_saw the heavens /being/_divided, and the \nd Spirit\nd* as /a/_dove coming_down on him.
\v 11 And /a/_voice became out_of the heavens: “You are the - beloved Son ˱of˲_me, ˱I˲_took_pleasure in you.”
\v 12 ¶ And immediately the \nd Spirit\nd* /is/_sending_ him _forth into the desert.
\v 13 And ˱he˲_was in the desert forty days, /being/_tempted by - Satan, and ˱he˲_was with the wild_beasts, and the angels /were/_serving ˱unto˲_him.
\v 14 ¶ And ¶ After - John - /to_be/_given_over, - \nd Jesus\nd* came into - Galilee, proclaiming the gospel - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*
\v 15 saying, - “The time /has_been/_fulfilled and the Kingdom - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd* /has/_neared; /be/_repenting and /be/_believing in the gospel.”
\v 16 ¶ And passing_by by the sea - ˱of˲_Galilee, ˱he˲_saw Simon and Andrew, the brother ˱of˲_Simon, casting \add a_net\add* in the sea, for ˱they˲_were fishermen.
\v 17 And - \nd Jesus\nd* said ˱to˲_them, “Come after me, and ˱I˲_/will_be/_making you_all /to/_become fishermen ˱of˲_people.”
\v 18 And immediately /having/_left their nets, ˱they˲_followed ˱after˲_him.
\v 19 And /having/_advanced little, ˱he˲_saw Jacobus the \add son\add* - ˱of˲_Zebedee, and John the brother ˱of˲_him, also them in the boat preparing the nets.
\v 20 And immediately ˱he˲_called them. And /having/_left Zebedee the father ˱of˲_them in the boat with the hired_hands, ˱they˲_went_away after him.
\v 21 ¶ And ˱they˲_/are/_entering_in into Capernaum. And immediately ˱on˲_the Sabbaths, /having/_come_in into the synagogue, ˱he˲_/was/_teaching.
\v 22 And ˱they˲_/were_being/_astonished at the teaching ˱of˲_him, for ˱he˲_was teaching them as \add one\add* having authority, and not as the scribes.
\v 23 And immediately /a/_man with /a/_=> unclean <=_spirit was in the synagogue ˱of˲_them, and ˱he˲_cried_out
\v 24 saying, “What ˱to˲_us and you, \nd Jesus\nd* Nazarean? ˱You˲_came /to/_destroy us? ˱I˲_/have/_known who you are, the Holy \add One\add* - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*!”
\v 25 And - \nd Jesus\nd* gave_rebuke ˱to˲_him saying, “/Be/_silenced and come_out out_of him!”
\v 26 And the - unclean spirit /having/_convulsed him, and /having/_called ˱with˲_/a/_=> loud <=_voice, ˱it˲_came_out from him.
\v 27 And all /were/_amazed, so_as /to_be/_debating them saying, “What is this? /a/_teaching new, with authority ˱he˲_/is/_commanding even ˱to˲_the - unclean spirits, and ˱they˲_/are/_submitting ˱to˲_him!”
\v 28 And the report ˱of˲_him came_out immediately everywhere into all the surrounding_region - ˱of˲_Galilee.
\v 29 ¶ And immediately /having/_come_out out_of the synagogue, ˱he˲_came into the house ˱of˲_Simon and Andrew, with Jacobus and John.
\v 30 And the mother_in_law ˱of˲_Simon /was/_lying being_feverish, and immediately ˱they˲_/are/_speaking ˱to˲_him about her.
\v 31 And /having/_approached, ˱he˲_raised her, /having/_taken_hold ˱of˲_her hand. And the fever left her, and ˱she˲_/was/_serving ˱unto˲_them.
\v 32 ¶ And /having/_become evening, when the sun set, ˱they˲_/were/_bringing all the \add ones\add* being sickly and the \add ones\add* being_demon_possessed to him.
\v 33 And all the city was /having_been/_gathered_together at the door.
\v 34 And ˱he˲_healed many being sickly ˱of˲_various diseases, and many demons ˱he˲_cast_out, and ˱he˲_/was/_=> not <=_allowing the demons, /to_be/_speaking because ˱they˲_/had/_known him. to_be \nd Messiah\nd*.
\v 35 ¶ And exceedingly early in_the_night, /having/_risen_up ˱he˲_came_out and went_away into /a/_=> desolate <=_place, and_there ˱he˲_/was/_praying.
\v 36 And Simon and the \add ones\add* with him searched_for him,
\v 37 and ˱they˲_found him and ˱they˲_/are/_saying ˱to˲_him, - “All /are/_seeking you!”
\v 38 And ˱he˲_/is/_saying ˱to˲_them, “˱We˲_/may_be/_going elsewhere into the neighboring villages, in_order_that also there ˱I˲_/may/_proclaim, for for this \add reason\add* ˱I˲_came_out.”
\v 39 And ˱he˲_came proclaiming, in the synagogues ˱of˲_them in all - Galilee, and casting_out - demons.
\v 40 ¶ And /a/_leper /is/_coming to him, imploring him saying ˱to˲_him, - “If ˱you˲_/may_be/_willing, ˱you˲_/are/_being_able /to/_cleanse me.”
\v 41 And /having_been/_feeling_compassion, /having/_stretched_out his hand ˱of˲_him, ˱he˲_touched and /is/_saying ˱to˲_him, “˱I˲_/am/_willing, /be/_cleansed.”
\v 42 And immediately the leprosy went_away from him, and ˱he˲_/was/_cleansed.
\v 43 And /having/_admonished ˱to˲_him, immediately sent_ him _forth,
\v 44 and ˱he˲_/is/_saying ˱to˲_him, “/Be/_seeing, ˱you˲_/may/_speak ˱to˲_no_one, but /be/_going, show yourself ˱to˲_the priest, and offer for the cleansing ˱of˲_you which Moses commanded, for /a/_testimony ˱to˲_them.”
\v 45 But he /having/_come_out began /to_be/_proclaiming much and /to_be/_spreading_abroad the word, so_that no_longer him /to_be/_able /to/_come_ openly _in into /the/_city, but ˱he˲_was outside in desolate places, and ˱they˲_/were/_coming to him on_every_side.
\c 2
\v 1 ¶ And /having/_come_in again into Capernaum through days, ˱it˲_/was/_heard that ˱he˲_is in /the/_house.
\v 2 And many /were/_gathered_together, so_that no_longer /to_be/_having_room, not \add even\add* - at the door, and ˱he˲_/was/_speaking the word ˱to˲_them.
\v 3 And ˱they˲_/are/_coming bringing /a/_paralytic to him, /being/_carried by four.
\v 4 And not being_able /to/_bring ˱to˲_him because_of the crowd, ˱they˲_unroofed the roof where ˱he˲_was, and /having/_dug_out \add it\add*, ˱they˲_/are/_lowering the pallet where the paralytic /was/_lying.
\v 5 And - \nd Jesus\nd* /having/_seen the faith ˱of˲_them, ˱he˲_/is/_saying ˱to˲_the paralytic, “Child, the sins ˱of˲_you /have_been/_forgiven.”
\v 6 But some ˱of˲_the scribes were there, sitting and reasoning in the hearts ˱of˲_them,
\v 7 “Why /is/_=> this \add man\add* <=_speaking thus? ˱He˲_/is/_slandering! Who /is/_able /to_be/_forgiving sins, except - one - \nd God\nd*?”
\v 8 And - \nd Jesus\nd* immediately /having/_known ˱in˲_the spirit ˱of˲_him that ˱they˲_/are/_reasoning thus in themselves, ˱he˲_/is/_saying ˱to˲_them, “Why these \add things\add* /to_be/_reasoning in the hearts ˱of˲_you_all?
\v 9 Which is easier, /to/_say ˱to˲_the paralytic, ‘The sins /have_been/_forgiven ˱to˲_you’. or /to/_say, ‘/Be/_raising and take_up the pallet ˱of˲_you and /be/_walking’?
\v 10 But in_order_that ˱you_all˲_/may_have/_known that the Son - ˱of˲_Man /is/_having authority on the earth /to_be/_forgiving sins”, (˱he˲_/is/_saying ˱to˲_the paralytic),
\v 11 “˱To˲_you ˱I˲_/am/_saying, /be/_raising take_up the pallet ˱of˲_you, and /be/_going to the home ˱of˲_you.”
\v 12 And ˱he˲_/was/_raised, and immediately /having/_taken_up the pallet, ˱he˲_came_out before all, so_as all /to_be/_marvelling, and /to_be/_glorifying - \nd God\nd* saying, - ˱we˲_> never <_saw.” “Thus
\v 13 ¶ And ˱he˲_came_out again beside the sea, and all the crowd /was/_coming to him, and ˱he˲_/was/_teaching them.
\v 14 And passing_by ˱he˲_saw Levi the \add son\add* - ˱of˲_Alpheus, sitting at the tax_office, and /is/_saying ˱to˲_him, “/Be/_following ˱after˲_me.” And /having/_risen_up, ˱he˲_followed ˱after˲_him.
\v 15 ¶ And /is/_becoming him /to_be/_reclining in the house ˱of˲_him, and many tax_collectors and sinners /were/_reclining - ˱with˲_\nd Jesus\nd* and the disciples ˱of˲_him, for ˱they˲_were many, and ˱they˲_/were/_following ˱after˲_him.
\v 16 And the scribes ˱of˲_the Pharisees, /having/_seen that ˱he˲_/is/_eating with the sinners and the tax_collectors, ˱they˲_/were/_saying ˱to˲_the disciples ˱of˲_him, - sinners the ˱he˲_/is/_eating with the tax_collectors and?”
\v 17 And /having/_heard, - \nd Jesus\nd* /is/_saying ˱to˲_them, “The \add ones\add* being_strong /are/_=> not <=_having need ˱of˲_/a/_physician, but the \add ones\add* being sickly. ˱I˲_came not /to/_call /the/_righteous, but sinners.”
\v 18 ¶ And the disciples ˱of˲_John and the Pharisees were fasting. And ˱they˲_/are/_coming and ˱they˲_/are/_saying ˱to˲_him, “for_ Why _reason the disciples ˱of˲_John and the disciples ˱of˲_the Pharisees /are/_fasting, but the your disciples /are/_=> not <=_fasting?”
\v 19 And - \nd Jesus\nd* said ˱to˲_them, the sons ˱of˲_the bridal_chamber in which the bridegroom with them is “Not /are/_being_able /to_be/_fasting? As_long_as time ˱they˲_/are/_having the bridegroom with them, /are/_=> not <=_being_able /to_be/_fasting.
\v 20 But days /will_be/_coming whenever the bridegroom /may_be/_taken_away from them, and then ˱they˲_/will_be/_fasting in that - day.
\v 21 ¶ No_one /is/_sewing_on /a/_patch ˱of˲_> unshrunken <_cloth on /a/_=> old <=_garment; and if not the patch /is/_tearing_away from it - new ˱from˲_the old, and /is/_becoming /a/_worse tear.
\v 22 And no_one /is/_putting new wine into old wineskins; and if not the wine /will_be/_bursting the wineskins, and the wine and the wineskins. /is_being/_destroyed But new wine into new wineskins.” Placeable \add is\add*.”
\v 23 ¶ And ˱it˲_became, him on the Sabbaths /to_be/_passing_through through the grainfields, and the disciples ˱of˲_him began /to_be/_making way, plucking the heads_of_grain.
\v 24 And the Pharisees /were/_saying ˱to˲_him, “Behold, why ˱they˲_/are/_doing ˱on˲_the Sabbaths what ˱it˲_/is/_=> not <=_permitting?”
\v 25 And ˱he˲_/is/_saying ˱to˲_them, “˱You_all˲_> never <_read what David did, when ˱he˲_had need and he and the \add ones\add* with him hungered?
\v 26 How ˱he˲_came_in into the house - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd* during Abiathar /the/_chief_priest, and ate the bread ˱of˲_the Presence, which ˱it˲_/is/_=> not <=_permitting /to/_eat, except - the priests, and ˱he˲_gave even ˱to˲_the \add ones\add* being with him?”,
\v 27 And ˱he˲_/was/_saying ˱to˲_them, “The Sabbath became because_of the person, and not the person because_of the Sabbath.
\v 28 So_then the Son - ˱of˲_Man is \nd Lord\nd* also ˱of˲_the Sabbath.”
\c 3
\v 1 ¶ And ˱he˲_came_in again into /the/_synagogue, and /a/_man was there, having the hand /having_been/_withered.
\v 2 And ˱they˲_/were/_watching_ him _closely, whether ˱he˲_/will_be/_healing him ˱on˲_the Sabbaths, in_order_that ˱they˲_/may/_accuse ˱against˲_him.
\v 3 And ˱he˲_/is/_saying ˱to˲_the man - having the withered, hand “/Be/_raising in the midst.”
\v 4 And ˱he˲_/is/_saying ˱to˲_them, “/Is/_˱it˲_permitting ˱on˲_the Sabbaths /to/_do_good or /to/_do_evil, /to/_save life or /to/_kill_off?” But they /were/_keeping_silent.
\v 5 And /having/_looked_around them with anger, grieving at the ˱to˲_hardening ˱of˲_the heart ˱of˲_them, ˱he˲_/is/_saying ˱to˲_the man, “Stretch_out the hand ˱of˲_you.” And ˱he˲_stretched_out \add it\add*, and the hand ˱of˲_him /was/_restored.
\v 6 And the Pharisees /having/_come_out, immediately with the Herodians ˱they˲_produced counsel against him, so_that ˱they˲_/may/_destroy him.
\v 7 ¶ And - \nd Jesus\nd* with the disciples ˱of˲_him, withdrew to the sea; and /a/_great multitude from - Galilee and from - Judea followed,
\v 8 and from Jerusalem, and from - Idumea, and beyond the Jordan, and around Tyre and Sidon, /a/_=> great <=_multitude hearing as_much_as ˱he˲_/was/_doing, came to him.
\v 9 And ˱he˲_told ˱to˲_the disciples ˱of˲_him that /a/_little_boat /may_be/_continuing ˱with˲_him because_of the crowd, in_order_that ˱they˲_/may_ not _be/_crowding him.
\v 10 For ˱he˲_healed many, so_that as_many_as /were/_having afflictions /to_be/_pressing_on ˱on˲_him, in_order_that /may/_touch ˱against˲_him.
\v 11 And the - unclean spirits, whenever ˱they˲_/were/_observing him, ˱they˲_/were/_falling_before ˱to˲_him and /were/_crying_out saying, - “You are the Son - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*.”
\v 12 And ˱he˲_/was/_warning much ˱to˲_them that ˱they˲_/may/_=> not <=_make him manifest.
\v 13 ¶ And ˱he˲_/is/_going_up on the mountain, and /is/_calling_to whom he /was/_wanting, and ˱they˲_went_away to him.
\v 14 And ˱he˲_established twelve, which also ˱he˲_named ambassadors, in_order_that ˱they˲_may_be with him, and in_order_that ˱he˲_/may_be/_sending_ them _out /to_be/_proclaiming
\v 15 and /to_be/_having authority /to_be/_casting_out - demons.
\v 16 And ˱he˲_established the twelve: and /he/_added_on /the/_name Peter - ˱to˲_Simon,
\v 17 and Jacobus the \add son\add* ˱of˲_the Zebedee, and John the brother - ˱of˲_Jacobus, and ˱he˲_added_on ˱to˲_them /the/_names Boanerges, which is “sons ˱of˲_thunder”,
\v 18 and Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and Jacobus the \add son\add* - ˱of˲_Alpheus, and Thaddeus, and Simon the Canaanite,
\v 19 and Judas Iscariot, who also gave_ him _over.
\v 20 ¶ And ˱he˲_/is/_coming to /a/_house, and the crowd /is/_coming_together again, so_that them /to_ not _be/_able /to/_=> not <=_eat bread.
\v 21 And the \add ones\add* with him /having/_heard \add it\add*, ˱they˲_came_out /to/_apprehend him, for ˱they˲_/were/_saying - “˱He˲_flipped_out.”
\v 22 And the scribes, - /having/_come_down from Jerusalem /were/_saying, ˱he˲_/is/_having - “Beelzeboul”, and, - “˱He˲_/is/_casting_out the demons by the ruler ˱of˲_the demons.”
\v 23 And /having/_called_to them, ˱he˲_/was/_saying ˱to˲_them in parables, “How /is/_=> Satan <=_able /to_be/_casting_out Satan?
\v 24 And if /a/_kingdom /may_be/_divided against itself, that - kingdom /is/_=> not <=_able /to_be/_established.
\v 25 And if /a/_house /may_be/_divided against itself, that - house /will_ not _be/_able /to_be/_established.
\v 26 And if - Satan rose_up against himself and /was/_divided, ˱he˲_/is/_=> not <=_able /to/_stand, but /is/_having /an/_end.
\v 27 But no_one /is/_=> not <=_able /having/_come_in into the house ˱of˲_the strong \add man\add* /to/_thoroughly_plunder the goods ˱of˲_him, if not first ˱he˲_/may/_bind the strong \add man\add*, and then ˱he˲_/will_be/_thoroughly_plundering the house ˱of˲_him.
\v 28 ¶ Truly, ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all that all the sins /will_be_being/_forgiven ˱to˲_the sons - ˱of˲_men and as_many_as the slander, - ˱they˲_/may/_slander.
\v 29 But - whoever /may/_slander against the - Holy \nd Spirit\nd*, /is/_=> not <=_having forgiveness to - eternity, but is liable ˱of˲_eternal sin”–
\v 30 because ˱they˲_/were/_saying, “˱He˲_/is/_having /a/_=> unclean <=_spirit.”
\v 31 ¶ And the mother ˱of˲_him and the brothers ˱of˲_him, /are/_coming, and standing outside, ˱they˲_sent_out to him calling him.
\v 32 And /the/_crowd /was/_sitting around him, and, ˱they˲_/are/_saying ˱to˲_him, “Behold, the mother ˱of˲_you and the brothers ˱of˲_you, /are/_seeking you outside.”
\v 33 And answering ˱to˲_them ˱he˲_/is/_saying, “Who is the mother ˱of˲_me, and the brothers ˱of˲_me?”
\v 34 And /having/_looked_around the \add ones\add* around him, sitting around ˱he˲_/is/_saying, “Behold, the mother ˱of˲_me and the brothers ˱of˲_me!
\v 35 For whoever - /may/_do the will - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*, this \add one\add* is /the/_brother ˱of˲_me and /the/_sister and /the/_mother.”
\c 4
\v 1 ¶ And again ˱he˲_began /to_be/_teaching beside the sea. And /a/_=> very_great <=_crowd /is_being/_gathered_together to him, so_that him /having/_boarded into the boat, /to_be/_sitting in the sea, and all the crowd were on the land to the sea.
\v 2 And ˱he˲_/was/_teaching them many \add things\add* in parables, and /was/_saying ˱to˲_them in the teaching ˱of˲_him,
\v 3 “/Be/_hearing! Behold, the \add one\add* sowing came_out /to/_sow.
\v 4 And ˱it˲_became at the \add time\add* /to_be/_sowing, some indeed fell along the road, and the birds came and devoured it.
\v 5 And other fell on the rocky \add place\add*, and where ˱it˲_/was/_=> not <=_having much soil, and immediately sprang_up because_of the /to_ not _be/_having depth ˱of˲_soil;
\v 6 and when the sun rose ˱it˲_/was/_scorched, and because_of the \add depth\add* /to_be/_having no root ˱it˲_/was/_withered.
\v 7 And other fell among the thorns, and the thorns went_up and choked it, and ˱it˲_> not <_gave fruit.
\v 8 And others fell on the - good soil, and ˱it˲_/was/_giving fruit, going_up and /being/_grown, and ˱it˲_/was/_bearing in thirty, and in sixty, and in /a/_hundred.”
\v 9 And ˱he˲_/was/_saying, “Who /is/_having ears /to_be/_hearing, /let_˱him˲_/be_hearing.”
\v 10 ¶ And when ˱he˲_became with only \add them\add*, they with the twelve about him /were/_asking him the parables.
\v 11 And ˱he˲_/was/_saying ˱to˲_them, “˱To˲_you_all the mystery ˱of˲_the Kingdom - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*; /has_been/_given; but ˱to˲_those who \add are\add* outside, all the \add things\add* /is/_becoming in parables,

\v 13 ¶ And ˱he˲_/is/_saying ˱to˲_them, “˱You_all˲_/have/_=> not <=_known - this parable, and how all the parables ˱you_all˲_/will_be/_knowing?
\v 14 The \add one\add* sowing /is/_sowing the word.
\v 15 And these are the \add ones\add* along the road, where the word /is_being/_sown, and whenever ˱they˲_/may/_hear, - Satan immediately /is/_coming, and /is/_carrying the word - /having_been/_sown in them.
\v 16 And these are likewise the \add ones\add* /being/_sown on the rocky \add places\add*, who whenever ˱they˲_/may/_hear the word, /are/_receiving it immediately with joy,

\v 5 And through all night and day in the tombs and in the mountains, ˱he˲_was crying_out and bruising himself ˱with˲_stones.
\v 6 And /having/_seen - \nd Jesus\nd* from afar, ˱he˲_ran and worshipped him,

\v 9 And ˱he˲_/was/_asking him, “What \add is\add* /the/_name ˱of˲_you?” And ˱he˲_/is/_saying ˱to˲_him, “Legion \add is\add* /the/_name ˱to˲_me, because ˱we˲_are many.”
\v 10 And ˱he˲_/was/_imploring him much that ˱he˲_/may/_=> not <=_send_out them out the country.
\v 11 And was there near the mountain, /a/_=> great <=_herd ˱of˲_pigs /being/_fed;

\v 13 And ˱he˲_permitted ˱to˲_them. And the - unclean spirits /having/_come_out, came_in into the pigs, and the herd about two_thousand rushed down the steep_bank into the sea, and ˱they˲_/were_being/_drowned in the sea.
\v 14 And the \add ones\add* feeding them fled, and ˱they˲_reported to the city and to the country. And came_out /to/_see what is the \add thing\add* /having/_become.
\v 15 And ˱they˲_/are/_coming to - \nd Jesus\nd*, and ˱they˲_/are/_observing the \add man\add* being_demon_possessed sitting, /having_been/_clothed and being_sensible, the \add one\add* /having/_had the Legion, and ˱they˲_/were/_afraid.
\v 16 And the \add ones\add* /having/_seen \add it\add* described ˱to˲_them, how ˱it˲_became ˱to˲_the \add one\add* being_demon_possessed, and concerning the pigs.
\v 17 And ˱they˲_began /to_be/_imploring him /to/_go_away from the regions ˱of˲_them.
\v 18 And him boarding into the boat, the \add one\add* /having_been/_demon_possessed /was/_begging him that ˱he˲_may_be with him.
\v 19 And ˱he˲_> not <_allowed him, but ˱he˲_/is/_saying ˱to˲_him, “/Be/_going to the home ˱of˲_you, to - your \add people\add*, and report ˱to˲_them as_much_as the \nd Lord\nd* /has/_done ˱for˲_you, and ˱he˲_showed_mercy ˱to˲_you.”
\v 20 And ˱he˲_went_away and began /to_be/_proclaiming in the Decapolis, as_much_as - \nd Jesus\nd* did ˱for˲_him, and all /were/_marveling.
\v 21 ¶ And - \nd Jesus\nd* /having/_crossed_over in the boat again to the \add side\add* across, /a/_=> great <=_crowd /was/_gathered_together to him, and ˱he˲_was beside the sea.
\v 22 And behold, one ˱of˲_the synagogue_leaders ˱by˲_/the/_name Jairus /is/_coming, and /having/_seen him, /is/_falling at the feet ˱of˲_him,

\v 24 And ˱he˲_went_away with him. ¶ And /a/_=> great <=_crowd /was/_following ˱after˲_him, and ˱they˲_/were/_pressing_on him.
\v 25 And /a/_woman being twelve years with /a/_hemorrhage ˱of˲_blood,
\v 26 and much /having/_suffered under many physicians, and /having/_spent all the \add things\add* by herself, and /having_been/_benefited nothing, but rather /having/_come to the worse,
\v 27 /having/_heard the \add things\add* concerning - \nd Jesus\nd*, /having/_come behind in the crowd, ˱she˲_touched ˱against˲_the garment ˱of˲_him.
\v 28 For ˱she˲_/was/_saying - “If ˱I˲_/may/_touch even_if ˱against˲_the garments ˱of˲_him, ˱I˲_/will_be_being/_healed.”
\v 29 And immediately the flow ˱of˲_the blood ˱of˲_her /was/_dried_up, and ˱she˲_knew ˱in˲_her body that ˱she˲_/has_been/_healed from the affliction.
\v 30 And immediately - \nd Jesus\nd*, /having/_known in himself the power /having/_come_out out_of him, /having_been/_turned_back in the crowd ˱he˲_/was/_saying, “Who touched ˱against˲_the clothes ˱of˲_me?”
\v 31 And the disciples ˱of˲_him /were/_saying ˱to˲_him, “˱You˲_/are/_seeing the crowd pressing_on you, and ˱you˲_/are/_saying, ‘Who touched ˱against˲_me?’”
\v 32 And ˱he˲_/was/_looking_around /to/_see the \add woman\add* /having/_done this.
\v 33 And the woman, /having_been/_afraid and trembling, /having/_known what /has/_become ˱to˲_her, came and fell_before ˱to˲_him, and told all the truth ˱to˲_him.
\v 34 And he said ˱to˲_her, “Daughter, the faith ˱of˲_you /has/_healed you; /be/_going in peace, and be healthy from the affliction ˱of˲_you.”
\v 35 ¶ Still ˱of˲_him speaking, ˱they˲_/are/_coming from the synagogue_leader saying, - “The daughter ˱of˲_you died_off; why ˱you˲_/are/_=> still <=_troubling the teacher?”
\v 36 But - \nd Jesus\nd* /having/_overheard the word /being/_spoken /is/_saying ˱to˲_the /the/_synagogue_leader, “/Be/_=> not <=_fearing, only /be/_believing.”
\v 37 And ˱he˲_> not <_allowed no_one with him /to/_accompany, except - - Peter, and Jacobus, and John the brother ˱of˲_Jacobus.
\v 38 And ˱they˲_/are/_coming to the house ˱of˲_the /the/_synagogue_leader, and ˱he˲_/is/_observing /a/_commotion, and weeping and much screaming.
\v 39 And /having/_come_in ˱he˲_/is/_saying ˱to˲_them, “Why ˱you_all˲_/are_being/_distressed and ˱you_all˲_/are/_weeping? The little_child not died_off, but /is/_sleeping.”
\v 40 And ˱they˲_/were/_ridiculing ˱of˲_him. But he /having/_cast_ all _out, /is/_taking the father ˱of˲_the little_child, and the mother, and the \add ones\add* with him, and ˱he˲_/is/_entering_in where the little_child was.
\v 41 And /having/_taken_hold ˱of˲_the hand ˱of˲_the little_child, ˱he˲_/is/_saying ˱to˲_her, “Talitha, koum!” Which is /being/_translated “- little_girl, ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you, /be/_raising!”
\v 42 And immediately the little_girl rose_up and ˱she˲_/was/_walking, for ˱she˲_was twelve ˱of˲_years. And ˱they˲_marvelled immediately ˱with˲_> great <_amazement.
\v 43 And ˱he˲_> much <_instructed ˱to˲_them that no_one /may/_know this, and ˱he˲_said /to_be/_given ˱to˲_her \add something\add* /to/_eat.

\v 1 ¶ And ˱he˲_came_out from_there, and ˱he˲_/is/_coming into the hometown ˱of˲_him, and the disciples ˱of˲_him /are/_following ˱after˲_him.
\v 2 And ˱of˲_/the/_Sabbath /having/_become, ˱he˲_began /to_be/_teaching in the synagogue; and many hearing /were_being/_astonished saying, “From_where these \add things\add*, ˱to˲_this \add man\add*, and what \add is\add* the wisdom - /having_been/_given ˱to˲_this \add one\add*, and the such miracles becoming by the hands ˱of˲_him?
\v 3 Is not this the carpenter, the son - ˱of˲_Mary, and brother ˱of˲_Jacobus, and Joses, and Judas, and Simon? And are not?” the sisters ˱of˲_him here with us?” And ˱they˲_/were_being/_offended at him.
\v 4 And - \nd Jesus\nd* /was/_saying ˱to˲_them, - “/A/_prophet is not dishonorable, except - in the hometown ˱of˲_him, and among the relatives ˱of˲_him, and in the house ˱of˲_him.”
\v 5 And ˱he˲_/was/_=> not <=_able there /to/_do not_one miracle, except - ˱for˲_/a/_few sick, /having/_laid_on the hands, ˱he˲_healed \add them\add*.
\v 6 And ˱he˲_marvelled because_of the unbelief ˱of˲_them. ¶ And ˱he˲_/was/_going_around the villages, around teaching.
\v 7 And ˱he˲_/is/_calling_to the twelve, and began /to_be/_sending_ them _out two ˱by˲_two, and /was/_giving authority ˱to˲_them ˱over˲_the - unclean spirits.
\v 8 And ˱he˲_commanded ˱to˲_them that ˱they˲_/may_be/_taking_away nothing for journey, except only - /a/_staff, not bread, not /a/_knapsack, not in the belt money,
\v 9 but /having/_tied_on sandals, and ˱you_all˲_/may/_=> not <=_dress_in two tunics.
\v 10 And ˱he˲_/was/_saying ˱to˲_them, “Wherever - ˱you_all˲_/may/_come_in into /a/_house, /be/_remaining there until - ˱you_all˲_/may/_come_out from_there.
\v 11 And whatever - place /may/_=> not <=_receive you_all, nor /may/_˱they˲_hear ˱from˲_you_all, going_out from_there, shake_off the dust which beneath the feet ˱of˲_you_all, for /a/_testimony ˱to˲_them.”
\v 12 And /having/_come_out, ˱they˲_proclaimed that ˱they˲_/may_be/_repenting.
\v 13 And ˱they˲_/were/_casting_out many demons, and ˱they˲_/were/_anointing many sick ˱with˲_olive_oil and ˱they˲_/were/_healing \add them\add*.
\v 14 ¶ And - king Herod heard, for the name ˱of˲_him became manifest, and ˱he˲_/was/_saying, - “John the \add one\add* baptizing /has_been/_raised from /the/_dead, and because_of this the miracles /are/_working in ˱in˲_him.”
\v 15 But others /were/_saying, - “˱He˲_is Elijah”; and others /were/_saying, - “/A/_prophet, like one ˱of˲_the prophets.”
\v 16 But /having/_heard, - Herod /was/_saying, - “John whom I beheaded, this /was/_raised!”
\v 17 For himself - Herod, /having/_sent_out apprehended - John, and bound him in prison because_of Herodias, the wife ˱of˲_Philip, the brother ˱of˲_him, because ˱he˲_married her.
\v 18 For - John /was/_saying - ˱to˲_Herod, - “˱It˲_/is/_=> not <=_permitting ˱for˲_you /to_be/_having the wife ˱of˲_the brother ˱of˲_you.”
\v 19 And - Herodias /was/_resenting him, and /was/_wanting /to/_kill_ him _off, and ˱he˲_/was/_=> not <=_able;

\v 21 And /having/_become /a/_=> opportune <=_day, when Herod ˱on˲_the birthday_celebrations ˱of˲_him made /a/_supper, ˱to˲_the magnates ˱of˲_him, and ˱to˲_the commanders, and ˱to˲_the leaders - ˱of˲_Galilee.
\v 22 And ˱of˲_Herodias the daughter ˱for˲_him, /having/_come_in, and /having/_danced ˱she˲_brought_pleasure - ˱to˲_Herod and the \add ones\add* reclining. And the king said ˱to˲_the little_girl, “Ask me whatever - ˱you˲_/may_be/_wanting, and ˱I˲_/will_be/_giving \add it\add* ˱to˲_you.”
\v 23 And ˱he˲_swore ˱to˲_her, - “Whatever “If ˱you˲_/may/_ask me, ˱I˲_/will_be/_giving ˱to˲_you, up_to half ˱of˲_the kingdom ˱of˲_me.”
\v 24 And /having/_come_out, ˱she˲_said ˱to˲_the mother ˱of˲_her, “What /may/_˱I˲_request?” And she said, “The head ˱of˲_John the \add one\add* baptizing.”
\v 25 And /having/_come_in immediately with earnestness to the king, ˱she˲_requested saying, “˱I˲_/am/_wanting that immediately ˱you˲_/may/_give the head ˱of˲_John the Baptist ˱to˲_me on /a/_platter.”
\v 26 And the king /having/_become very_sorrowful, because_of the oaths and the \add ones\add* reclining ˱he˲_> not <_wanted /to/_reject her.
\v 27 And immediately the king /having/_sent_out /an/_executioner, commanded /to/_bring the head ˱of˲_him. And /having/_gone_away, ˱he˲_beheaded him in the prison,
\v 28 and brought the head ˱of˲_him on /a/_platter, and gave it ˱to˲_the little_girl, and the little_girl gave it ˱to˲_the mother ˱of˲_her.
\v 29 And /having/_heard \add it\add*, the disciples ˱of˲_him came, and took_up the corpse ˱of˲_him, and ˱they˲_laid it in /a/_tomb.
\v 30 ¶ And the ambassadors /are_being/_gathered_together to - \nd Jesus\nd* and ˱they˲_reported ˱to˲_him, all \add things\add* as_much_as ˱they˲_did and as_much_as ˱they˲_taught.
\v 31 And ˱he˲_/is/_saying ˱to˲_them, “Come you_all yourselves by yourselves to /a/_desolate place, and rest /a/_little.” For the \add ones\add* coming and the \add ones\add* going were many, and ˱they˲_/were/_=> not_even <=_having_opportunity. /to/_eat.
\v 32 And ˱they˲_went_away by the boat into /a/_=> desolate <=_place by themselves.
\v 33 And many ˱they˲_saw them going, and recognized \add them\add*, and from all the /the/_cities ˱they˲_ran_together there on_foot, and ˱they˲_went_ahead ˱of˲_them.
\v 34 And /having/_come_out, ˱he˲_saw /a/_great crowd and ˱he˲_/was/_feeling_compassion to them, because ˱they˲_were as sheep not having /a/_shepherd, and ˱he˲_began /to_be/_teaching them many \add things\add*.
\v 35 And /the/_hour already ˱it˲_/having/_become late, the disciples ˱of˲_him /having/_approached ˱to˲_him, /were/_saying, - “The place is desolate, and \add it_is\add* already /an/_=> late <=_hour;

\v 37 But answering he said ˱to˲_them, “You_all give \add something\add* ˱to˲_them /to/_eat.” And ˱they˲_/are/_saying ˱to˲_him, “/Having/_gone_away, /may/_˱we˲_buy two_hundred ˱of˲_denarii loaves, and ˱we˲_/will_be/_giving \add something\add* ˱to˲_them /to/_eat?”
\v 38 And he /is/_saying ˱to˲_them, “How_many loaves /are/_˱you_all˲_having? /Be/_going, see.” And /having/_known ˱they˲_/are/_saying, “Five and two fishes.”
\v 39 And ˱he˲_commanded ˱to˲_them /to/_sit_down all, groups ˱by˲_groups on the green grass.
\v 40 And sat_down groups ˱by˲_groups, by hundred and by fifty.
\v 41 And /having/_taken the five loaves and the two fishes, /having/_looked_up to the sky, ˱he˲_blessed and broke_up the loaves, and /was/_giving ˱to˲_the disciples ˱of˲_him, in_order_that ˱they˲_/may_be/_setting_before ˱to˲_them, and ˱he˲_divided the two fishes ˱to˲_all.
\v 42 And ˱they˲_ate all and /were/_satisfied.
\v 43 And ˱they˲_took_up fragments ˱of˲_twelve baskets fillings, and of the fishes.
\v 44 And the \add ones\add* /having/_eaten the loaves were, five_thousand men.
\v 45 ¶ And immediately ˱he˲_compelled the disciples ˱of˲_him /to/_board into the boat, and /to_be/_going_before to the \add side\add* across to Bethsaida, until he /is/_sending_away the crowd.
\v 46 And /having/_bid_goodbye ˱to˲_them, ˱he˲_went_away into the mountain /to/_pray.
\v 47 ¶ And /having/_become evening, the boat was in /the/_midst ˱of˲_the sea, and only he on the land.
\v 48 And /having/_seen them /being/_tormented in the \add time\add* /to_be/_rowing, for the wind was contrary ˱to˲_them, about /the/_fourth watch ˱of˲_the night, ˱he˲_/is/_coming to them, walking on the sea, and /was/_wanting /to/_pass_by them.
\v 49 And, they /having/_seen him on the sea walking, supposed that ˱he˲_is /a/_ghost, and ˱they˲_cried_out.
\v 50 For all saw him, and /were/_disturbed. And he immediately spoke with them, and /is/_saying ˱to˲_them, “/Be/_having_courage, I am \add he\add*, /be/_=> not <=_fearing.”
\v 51 And ˱he˲_went_up to them into the boat, and the wind died_down. And ˱they˲_/were/_marveling exceedingly in themselves,

\v 53 ¶ And /having/_crossed_over to - land ˱they˲_came to Gennesaret, and /were/_anchored.
\v 54 And ˱of˲_them ˱on˲_/having/_come_out out_of the boat, immediately /having/_recognized him,

\v 56 And wherever - ˱he˲_/was/_entering_in into villages, or into cities, or into fields, in the marketplaces ˱they˲_/were/_laying the \add ones\add* ailing, and ˱they˲_/were/_imploring him that ˱they˲_/may/_touch even_if ˱against˲_the fringe ˱of˲_the garment ˱of˲_him; and as_many_as - touched ˱against˲_him /were_being/_healed.

\v 1 ¶ And the Pharisees and some ˱of˲_the scribes, /having/_come from Jerusalem /are_being/_gathered_together to him,
\v 2 and /having/_seen some ˱of˲_the disciples ˱of˲_him, that ˱they˲_/are/_eating the loaves ˱with˲_unclean hands, this is ˱with˲_unwashed.
\v 3 (For the /the/_Pharisees and all the Jews, /are/_=> not <=_eating if ˱they˲_/may/_=> not <=_wash the hands ˱with˲_/the/_fist, taking_hold_of the tradition ˱of˲_the elders,
\v 4 and from /the/_marketplace ˱they˲_/are/_=> not <=_eating if ˱they˲_/may/_=> not <=_wash, and many other \add things\add* ˱there˲_is which ˱they˲_received /to_be/_taking_hold_of, washings ˱of˲_cups and pitchers and copper_kettles.)
\v 5 And the Pharisees /are/_asking him and the scribes, “for_ Why _reason the disciples ˱of˲_you /are/_=> not <=_walking according_to the tradition ˱of˲_the elders, but ˱they˲_/are/_eating the bread ˱with˲_common hands?”
\v 6 And he answering said ˱to˲_them, “Isaiah rightly prophesied concerning you_all - hypocrites, as ˱it˲_/has_been/_written, - ‘this - people /is/_honoring me ˱with˲_the lips, but the heart ˱of˲_them /is/_being_away far_away from me.
\v 7 And ˱they˲_/are/_worshipping me uselessly, teaching /the/_commandments ˱of˲_humans ˱as˲_teachings.’
\v 8 /Having/_left the commandment - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*, ˱you_all˲_/are/_taking_hold_of the tradition - ˱of˲_humans.”
\v 9 ¶ And ˱he˲_/was/_saying ˱to˲_them, “˱You_all˲_/are/_rejecting well the commandment - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*, in_order_that ˱you_all˲_/may/_keep the tradition ˱of˲_you_all.
\v 10 For Moses said, ‘/be/_honoring the father ˱of˲_you and the mother ˱of˲_you’, and, ‘the \add one\add* speaking_evil father or mother ˱in˲_death /let_be/_dying.’
\v 11 But you_all /are/_saying, ‘If /a/_person /may/_say ˱to˲_the father or the mother, ‘“whatever ˱you˲_/may_be/_benefited - from me “\add It_is\add* korban (that is /a/_gift’,
\v 12 ˱you_all˲_/are/_=> no_longer <=_allowing him /to/_do nothing ˱for˲_the father or the mother,
\v 13 annulling the word - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd* ˱for˲_the tradition ˱of˲_you_all ˱to˲_which ˱you_all˲_gave_over. And many similar such \add things\add* ˱you_all˲_/are/_doing.”
\v 14 ¶ And /having/_called_to again the crowd, ˱he˲_/was/_saying ˱to˲_them, “All /be/_hearing ˱from˲_me and /be/_understanding:
\v 15 ˱there˲_is nothing outside the person entering_in into him, which /is/_able /to/_defile him but the \add things\add* going_out out_of the person, is the \add things\add* defiling the person.”
\v 16
\v 17 ¶ And when ˱he˲_came_in into /the/_house from the crowd, the disciples ˱of˲_him /were/_asking him the parable.
\v 18 And ˱he˲_/is/_saying ˱to˲_them, “Are you_all thus also unintelligent? ˱You_all˲_/are/_=> not <=_understanding that everything entering_in the \add part\add* outside into the person, /is/_=> not <=_able /to/_defile him,
\v 19 because ˱it˲_/is/_=> not <=_entering_in into the heart ˱of˲_him, but into the belly, and ˱it˲_/is/_going_out into the latrine?” (Purifying all the foods.)
\v 20 And ˱he˲_/was/_saying - “The \add thing\add* going_out out_of the person, that /is/_defiling the person.
\v 21 For from inside the heart - ˱of˲_people /are/_going_out the - evil speculations, sexual_immoralities, thefts, murders, adulteries,
\v 22 greediness, wickedness, deceit, wantonness, eyeing evil, slander, pride, foolishness.
\v 23 All these - evil \add things\add* inside /is/_going_out and /is/_defiling the person.”
\v 24 ¶ And from_there /having/_risen_up, ˱he˲_went_away into the regions ˱of˲_Tyre and Sidon. And /having/_come_in into /the/_house, ˱he˲_/was/_wanting no_one /to/_know, but /was/_=> not <=_able /to/_escape_notice.
\v 25 But immediately /a/_woman /having/_heard about him, ˱of˲_whom the little_daughter /was/_having ˱of˲_her /a/_=> unclean <=_spirit /having/_come, fell_before at the feet ˱of˲_him.
\v 26 And the woman was Greek, Syrophoenician - ˱by˲_descent, and ˱she˲_/was/_asking him that ˱he˲_/may/_cast_out the demon out_of the daughter ˱of˲_her.
\v 27 And ˱he˲_/was/_saying ˱to˲_her, “Allow the children /to_be/_satisfied first, for ˱it˲_is not good /to/_take the bread ˱of˲_the children, and /to/_cast \add it\add* ˱to˲_the little_dogs.”
\v 28 And she answered and /is/_saying ˱to˲_him, “Yes, \nd Lord\nd*, even the little_dogs beneath the table /are/_eating of the little_crumbs ˱of˲_the little_children.”
\v 29 And ˱he˲_said ˱to˲_her, “Because_of this - word /be/_going, the demon, /has/_come_out.” out_of the daughter ˱of˲_you.”
\v 30 And /having/_gone_away to the home ˱of˲_her, ˱she˲_found the demon /having/_come_out. and the little_child /having_been/_laid on the bed,
\v 31 ¶ And again /having/_come_out from the regions ˱of˲_Tyre, ˱he˲_came through Sidon to the sea - ˱of˲_Galilee, among /the/_midst ˱of˲_the regions ˱of˲_Decapolis.
\v 32 And ˱they˲_/are/_bringing /a/_deaf and speech_impaired \add man\add* ˱to˲_him, and ˱they˲_/are/_imploring him that ˱he˲_/may/_lay_on his hand. ˱on˲_him.
\v 33 And /having/_taken_ him _back from the crowd by himself, ˱he˲_put the fingers ˱of˲_him to the ears ˱of˲_him, and /having/_spat, touched ˱against˲_the tongue ˱of˲_him,
\v 34 and /having/_looked_up to the sky ˱he˲_groaned, and /is/_saying ˱to˲_him, “Ephphatha”, that is, “/be/_opened_up”.
\v 35 And the ears ˱of˲_him /were/_opened_up, and the bond ˱of˲_the tongue ˱of˲_him /was/_loosed, and ˱he˲_/was/_speaking correctly.
\v 36 And ˱he˲_instructed ˱to˲_them that ˱they˲_/may_be/_telling ˱to˲_no_one. But as_much_as /was/_instructing ˱to˲_them, they /were/_proclaiming \add it\add* more more_abundantly.
\v 37 And ˱they˲_/were_being/_=> exceedingly <=_astonished saying, “˱He˲_/has/_done all \add things\add* well, ˱he˲_/is/_making both the deaf /to_be/_hearing, and /the/_mute /to_be/_speaking.”
\c 8
\v 1 ¶ In those - days again, /the/_crowd ˱of˲_being great, and not having anything ˱they˲_/may/_eat, /having/_called_to the disciples ˱of˲_him, ˱he˲_/is/_saying ˱to˲_them,
\v 2 “˱I˲_/am/_feeling_compassion for the crowd, because ˱they˲_/are/_=> already <=_remaining ˱with˲_me three days, and ˱they˲_/are/_=> not <=_having anything ˱they˲_/may/_eat.
\v 3 And if ˱I˲_/may/_send_ them _away hungry to home ˱of˲_them, ˱they˲_/will_be_being/_exhausted on the way. And some ˱of˲_them /have/_come from afar.”
\v 4 And the disciples ˱of˲_him answered ˱to˲_him, “From_where /will_ anyone _be/_able /to/_satisfy these ˱with˲_loaves here in desert?”
\v 5 And ˱he˲_/was/_asking them, “How_many loaves /are/_˱you_all˲_having?” And they said, “Seven.”
\v 6 And ˱he˲_/is/_commanding ˱to˲_the crowd /to/_sit_down on the ground. And /having/_taken the seven loaves, /having/_given_thanks ˱he˲_broke and ˱he˲_/was/_giving ˱to˲_the disciples ˱of˲_him, in_order_that ˱they˲_/may_be/_setting_before \add them\add*, and ˱they˲_set_before \add it\add* ˱to˲_the crowd.
\v 7 And /were/_having /a/_few little_fishes; and /having/_blessed \add them\add* them, ˱he˲_told also these \add things\add* /to_be/_setting_before \add them\add*.
\v 8 And ˱they˲_ate and /were/_satisfied, and ˱they˲_took_up /the/_excess ˱of˲_fragments seven baskets.
\v 9 And ˱they˲_were they /having/_eaten about four_thousand. And ˱he˲_sent_ them _away.
\v 10 And immediately /having/_boarded into the boat with the disciples ˱of˲_him, ˱he˲_came into the districts ˱of˲_Dalmanutha.
\v 11 ¶ And the Pharisees came_out and, ˱they˲_began /to_be/_debating ˱against˲_him, seeking /a/_sign from the sky from him, testing him.
\v 12 And /having/_sighed_deeply ˱in˲_the spirit ˱of˲_him ˱he˲_/is/_saying, “Why - /is/_=> this generation <=_seeking /a/_sign? Truly, ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all, this /will_ never _be_being/_given - ˱to˲_> /a/_sign <_generation.”
\v 13 And /having/_left them, again /having/_boarded ˱he˲_went_away to the \add side\add* across.
\v 14 ¶ And ˱they˲_forgot /to/_take loaves, and except - one loaf ˱they˲_/were/_=> not <=_having with themselves in the boat.
\v 15 And ˱he˲_/was/_instructing ˱to˲_them saying, “/Be/_seeing, /be/_watching_out for the leaven ˱of˲_the Pharisees and ˱of˲_the leaven ˱of˲_Herod.”
\v 16 And ˱they˲_/were/_reasoning with one_another, Because ˱they˲_/are/_=> not <=_having loaves.
\v 17 And /having/_known \add it\add*, - \nd Jesus\nd* ˱he˲_/is/_saying ˱to˲_them, “Why /are/_˱you_all˲_reasoning because ˱you_all˲_/are/_=> not <=_having loaves? ˱You_all˲_/are/_=> not_yet <=_understanding, nor ˱you_all˲_/are/_understanding? /are/_˱you_all˲_having the heart ˱of˲_you_all /Having_been/_hardened?
\v 18 ‘Having eyes, ˱you_all˲_/are/_=> not <=_seeing? And having ears, ˱you_all˲_/are/_=> not <=_hearing?’ And ˱you_all˲_/are/_=> not <=_remembering?
\v 19 When ˱I˲_broke the five loaves for the five_thousand, how_many baskets full ˱of˲_fragments?” ˱you_all˲_took_up?” ˱They˲_/are/_saying ˱to˲_him, “Twelve.”
\v 20 “When and the seven loaves for the four_thousand, ˱of˲_how_many baskets /the/_fillings ˱of˲_fragments ˱you_all˲_took_up?” and ˱they˲_/are/_saying “Seven.”
\v 21 And ˱he˲_/was/_saying ˱to˲_them, “How ˱you_all˲_/are/_=> not_yet <=_understanding?”
\v 22 ¶ And ˱they˲_/are/_coming to Bethsaida, and ˱they˲_/are/_bringing /a/_blind \add man\add* ˱to˲_him, and ˱they˲_/are/_imploring him that ˱he˲_/may/_touch ˱against˲_him.
\v 23 And /having/_taken_hold ˱of˲_the hand ˱of˲_the blind \add man\add*, ˱he˲_brought_ him _out out ˱of˲_the village, and /having/_spat in the eyes ˱of˲_him, /having/_laid_on the hands ˱on˲_him, ˱he˲_/was/_asking him, “- /are/_˱you˲_seeing anything?”
\v 24 And /having/_looked_up ˱he˲_said, “˱I˲_/am/_seeing the people, because ˱I˲_/am/_seeing \add them\add* walking as trees.”
\v 25 Thereafter again ˱he˲_laid_on the hands on the eyes ˱of˲_him, and ˱he˲_saw_clearly and ˱he˲_restored \add him\add* and ˱he˲_/was/_looking_at all \add things\add* clearly.
\v 26 And ˱he˲_sent_out him to /the/_home ˱of˲_him saying, “˱You˲_/may/_=> not <=_come_in into the village.”
\v 27 ¶ And - \nd Jesus\nd* and the disciples ˱of˲_him came_out into the villages ˱of˲_Caesarea - Philippi. And on the way ˱he˲_/was/_asking the disciples ˱of˲_him saying ˱to˲_them, “Whom /are/_=> the people <=_saying me to_be?”
\v 28 And they spoke ˱to˲_him saying, - “John the Baptist, and others Elijah, but others - one ˱of˲_the prophets.”
\v 29 And he /was/_asking them, “But whom you_all /are/_saying me to_be?” And - Peter answering /is/_saying ˱to˲_him, “You are the \nd Messiah\nd*.”
\v 30 And ˱he˲_warned ˱to˲_them that ˱they˲_/may_be/_telling no_one concerning him.
\v 31 ¶ And ˱he˲_began /to_be/_teaching them that ˱it˲_/is/_fitting the Son - ˱of˲_Man /to/_suffer many \add things\add*, and /to_be/_rejected by the elders and the chief_priests and the scribes, and /to_be/_killed_off, and /to/_rise_up after three days.
\v 32 And ˱he˲_/was/_speaking the word ˱with˲_plainness. And /having/_taken_ him _aside, - Peter began /to_be/_giving_rebuke ˱to˲_him.
\v 33 And he, /having_been/_turned_back and /having/_seen the disciples ˱of˲_him, gave_rebuke - ˱to˲_Peter and /is/_saying, “/Be/_going behind me, Satan, because ˱you˲_/are/_=> not <=_thinking the \add things\add* - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*, but the \add things\add* - ˱of˲_humans.”
\v 34 ¶ And /having/_called_to the crowd with the disciples ˱of˲_him, ˱he˲_said ˱to˲_them, “If anyone /is/_wanting /to_be/_following after me /let/_˱him˲_renounce himself, and /let/_˱him˲_take_up the cross ˱of˲_him, and /let_˱him˲_/be_following ˱after˲_me.
\v 35 For whoever - /may_be/_wanting /to/_save the life ˱of˲_him, /will_be/_losing it, but whoever - /will_be/_losing the life ˱of˲_him on_account me and ˱of˲_the gospel, /will_be/_saving it.
\v 36 For what /is/_˱it˲_benefiting /a/_person, ˱he˲_/may/_gain the world whole and the soul ˱of˲_him /to_be/_lost?
\v 37 For what /will_ /a/_person _be/_giving ˱as˲_/an/_exchange ˱for˲_the soul ˱of˲_him?
\v 38 For whoever - /may_be/_ashamed_of me and - my words in - this - adulterous and sinful generation, the Son - ˱of˲_Man /will_ also _be_being/_ashamed ˱of˲_him whenever ˱he˲_/may/_come in the glory ˱of˲_the Father ˱of˲_him, with the - holy angels.”
\c 9
\v 1 And ˱he˲_/was/_saying ˱to˲_them, “Truly, ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all that are some ˱of˲_the \add ones\add* /having/_stood here, who by_no_means /may/_=> not <=_taste ˱of˲_death, until - ˱they˲_/may/_see the Kingdom - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd* /having/_come with power.”
\v 2 ¶ And after six days, - \nd Jesus\nd* /is/_taking - Peter, and - Jacobus, and - John, and /is/_bringing_up them into /a/_=> high <=_mountain by themselves only. And ˱he˲_/was/_transformed before them,
\v 3 and the clothes ˱of˲_him became shining exceedingly white, such_as /a/_launderer on the earth /is/_=> not <=_able /to/_whiten thus.
\v 4 And Elijah with Moses /was/_seen ˱to˲_them, and ˱they˲_were conversing_with - ˱with˲_\nd Jesus\nd*.
\v 5 And - Peter answering /is/_saying - ˱to˲_\nd Jesus\nd*, “Rabbi, ˱it˲_is good ˱for˲_us to_be here, and ˱we˲_/may/_make three tents, one ˱for˲_you, and one ˱for˲_Moses, and one ˱for˲_Elijah.”
\v 6 For ˱he˲_/had/_=> not <=_known what ˱he˲_/may/_answer; for ˱they˲_became terrified.
\v 7 And /a/_cloud became overshadowing ˱on˲_them, and /a/_voice became: out_of the cloud: “This is the the beloved Son ˱of˲_me, /be/_hearing ˱from˲_him.”
\v 8 And suddenly /having/_looked_around, ˱they˲_> no_longer <_saw no_one, except only - - \nd Jesus\nd* with themselves.
\v 9 ¶ And them coming_down from the mountain, ˱he˲_instructed ˱to˲_them that ˱they˲_/may/_describe ˱to˲_no_one what ˱they˲_saw, except - whenever the Son - ˱of˲_Man /may/_rise_up from /the/_dead.
\v 10 And ˱they˲_took_hold_of the statement to themselves, debating what is the \add meaning\add* of /the/_dead /to/_rise_up.
\v 11 And ˱they˲_/were/_asking him saying, - “The scribes /are/_saying that ˱it˲_/is/_fitting Elijah /to/_come first?”
\v 12 And he /was/_saying ˱to˲_them, “Elijah indeed /having/_come first /is/_restoring all \add things\add*, but how /has_˱it˲_/been_written concerning the Son - ˱of˲_Man, that ˱he˲_/may/_suffer many \add things\add* and /may_be/_scorned?
\v 13 But ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all that Elijah /has/_=> also <=_come, and ˱they˲_did ˱to˲_him as_much_as ˱they˲_/were/_wanting, as ˱it˲_/has_been/_written concerning him.”
\v 14 ¶ And /having/_come to the disciples, ˱he˲_saw /a/_=> great <=_crowd around them, and /the/_scribes debating with ˱with˲_them.
\v 15 And immediately all the crowd /having/_seen him /were/_greatly_amazed, and running_up ˱they˲_/were/_greeting him.
\v 16 And ˱he˲_asked them, “What /are/_˱you_all˲_debating with them?”
\v 17 And one out_of the crowd answered ˱to˲_him, “Teacher, ˱I˲_brought the son ˱of˲_me to you, having /a/_=> mute <=_spirit.
\v 18 And wherever ˱it˲_/may/_grasp - him, ˱it˲_/is/_attacking him, and ˱he˲_/is/_foaming and /is/_gnashing his teeth, and /is_being/_paralyzed. And ˱I˲_told ˱to˲_the disciples ˱of˲_you that ˱they˲_/may/_cast_ it _out, and ˱they˲_> not <_prevailed.”
\v 19 And he answering ˱to˲_them /is/_saying, “O unbelieving generation! Until when ˱I˲_will_be with you_all? Until when ˱I˲_/will_be/_tolerating ˱of˲_you_all? /Be/_bringing him to me.”
\v 20 And ˱they˲_brought him to him. And /having/_seen him, the spirit immediately threw_ him _into_convulsions, and /having/_fallen on the ground, ˱he˲_/was/_rolling foaming.
\v 21 And ˱he˲_asked the father ˱of˲_him, “How_much time ˱it˲_is, until this /has/_become ˱with˲_him?” And he said, “From from_childhood.
\v 22 And often him ˱it˲_cast both into fire and into waters, in_order_that ˱it˲_/may/_destroy him. But if anything ˱you˲_/are/_being_able, give_help ˱to˲_us, /having_been/_feeling_compassion on us.”
\v 23 And - \nd Jesus\nd* said ˱to˲_him, - “If ˱you˲_/are/_being_able? All \add things\add* possible ˱to˲_the \add one\add* believing.”
\v 24 And immediately /having/_cried_out, the father ˱of˲_the little_child /was/_saying, “˱I˲_/am/_believing, /be/_giving_help ˱of˲_me ˱for˲_the unbelief!”
\v 25 And - \nd Jesus\nd* /having/_seen that /a/_crowd /is/_running_together, ˱he˲_gave_rebuke ˱to˲_the - unclean spirit saying ˱to˲_it, “- mute and deaf spirit, I /am/_commanding ˱to˲_you, come_out out_of him, and no_longer ˱you˲_/may/_come_in into him.”
\v 26 And /having/_cried_out, and /having/_convulsed much, ˱it˲_came_out; and ˱he˲_became as_if dead, so_that - many /to_be/_saying that ˱he˲_died_off.
\v 27 And - \nd Jesus\nd* /having/_taken_hold ˱of˲_the hand ˱of˲_him, raised him, and ˱he˲_rose_up.
\v 28 And him /having/_come_in into /a/_house, the disciples ˱of˲_him by themselves /were/_asking him, - “We /were/_=> not <=_able /to/_cast_out it?”
\v 29 And ˱he˲_said ˱to˲_them, “This - kind /is/_able /to/_come_out by nothing, except - by prayer and fasting.”
\v 30 ¶ And_from_there /having/_come_out, ˱they˲_/were/_passing_through through - Galilee, and ˱he˲_/was/_=> not <=_wanting that anyone /may/_know;
\v 31 for ˱he˲_/was/_teaching the disciples ˱of˲_him, and /was/_saying ˱to˲_them, - “The Son - ˱of˲_Man /is_being/_given_over into /the/_hands ˱of˲_men, and ˱they˲_/will_be/_killing_ him _off, and /having_been/_killed_off, after three days ˱he˲_/will_be/_rising_up.”
\v 32 And they /were/_not_knowing ˱of˲_the saying, and ˱they˲_/were/_fearing /to/_ask him.
\v 33 ¶ And ˱they˲_came to Capernaum. And /having/_become in the house, ˱he˲_/was/_asking them, “What /were/_˱you_all˲_reasoning on the way?”
\v 34 And they /were/_keeping_silent, for ˱they˲_/were/_discussing with one_another on the road, who \add was\add* greater.
\v 35 And /having/_sat_down, ˱he˲_called the twelve and /is/_saying ˱to˲_them, “If anyone /is/_wanting to_be first, ˱he˲_will_be last ˱of˲_all and servant ˱of˲_all.”
\v 36 And /having/_taken /a/_little_child, ˱he˲_stood him in /the/_midst ˱of˲_them, and /having/_embraced him, ˱he˲_said ˱to˲_them,
\v 37 “Whoever /may/_receive - one - ˱of˲_such little_children in the name ˱of˲_me, /is/_receiving me; and whoever /may/_receive - me, /is/_=> not <=_receiving me, but the \add one\add* /having/_sent_ me _out.”
\v 38 ¶ - John /was/_saying ˱to˲_him, “Teacher, ˱we˲_saw someone casting_out demons in the name ˱of˲_you, and ˱we˲_/were/_forbidding him, because ˱he˲_/was/_=> not <=_following ˱with˲_us.”
\v 39 And - \nd Jesus\nd* said, “/Be/_=> not <=_forbidding him, for is no_one who /will_be/_doing /a/_miracle in the name ˱of˲_me, /will_be/_able also quickly /to/_speak_evil_of me.
\v 40 For whoever is not against us, is for us.

\v 23 In the resurrection, ˱of˲_which ˱of˲_them will_be_˱she˲ /the/_wife? For the seven had her ˱as˲_/a/_wife.”
\v 24 - \nd Jesus\nd* /Was/_saying ˱to˲_them, “Not /are_˱you_all˲_/being_strayed because_of this, not /having/_known the Scriptures, nor the power - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*?
\v 25 For whenever ˱they˲_/may/_rise_up from /the/_dead, ˱they˲_/are/_=> neither <=_marrying nor /are_being/_betrothed, but ˱they˲_are like angels in the heavens.
\v 26 But concerning the dead, that ˱they˲_/are_being/_raised, not ˱you_all˲_read in the scroll ˱of˲_Moses concerning the thorn_bush, how - \nd God\nd* spoke ˱to˲_him saying, ‘I \add am\add* the \nd God\nd* ˱of˲_Abraham, and \nd God\nd* ˱of˲_Isaac, and the \nd God\nd* ˱of˲_Jacob’?
\v 27 Not is \nd God\nd* ˱of˲_/the/_dead, but ˱of˲_/the/_living. ˱You_all˲_/are_being/_=> much <=_strayed.”
\v 28 ¶ And one ˱of˲_the scribes /having/_approached, /having/_heard ˱of˲_them debating, /having/_seen that ˱he˲_answered well ˱to˲_them, asked him, “Which commandment is?” /the/_first ˱of˲_all?”
\v 29 - \nd Jesus\nd* answered, - “/The/_first is: ‘Israel /be/_hearing, /the/_\nd Lord\nd* the \nd God\nd* ˱of˲_us is One \nd Lord\nd*,
\v 30 and ˱you˲_/will_be/_loving /the/_\nd Lord\nd* the \nd God\nd* ˱of˲_you, with all the heart ˱of˲_you, and with all the soul ˱of˲_you, and with all the mind ˱of˲_you, and with all the strength ˱of˲_you.’
\v 31 /The/_second \add is\add* this: ‘˱you˲_/will_be/_loving the neighbor ˱of˲_you as yourself.’ Another commandment is not greater \add than\add* these.”
\v 32 And the scribe said ˱to˲_him, “Rightly, Teacher, in truth /having/_said, - ‘one ˱he˲_is, and ˱there˲_is not another except him’,
\v 33 and, - ‘/to_be/_loving him with all the heart, and with all the intelligence, and with all the strength’, and, - ‘/to_be/_loving his neighbor as yourself’, is more_important all the whole_burnt_offerings and sacrifices.”
\v 34 And - \nd Jesus\nd*, /having/_seen him, that ˱he˲_answered intelligently, said ˱to˲_him, “˱You˲_are not far from the Kingdom - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*.” And no_one no_longer /was/_daring /to/_ask him.
\v 35 ¶ And - \nd Jesus\nd* answering teaching in the temple /was/_saying, “How /are/_=> the scribes <=_saying that the \nd Messiah\nd*, is /the/_son ˱of˲_David?
\v 36 himself David said by the - holy \nd Spirit\nd*, ‘the \nd Lord\nd* ‘said ˱to˲_the \nd Lord\nd* ˱of˲_me, “/Be/_sitting on /the/_right \add hand\add* ˱of˲_me, until - ˱I˲_/may/_put the enemies ˱of˲_you beneath ˱of˲_the feet ˱of˲_you.”’
\v 37 David himself /is/_calling him, ‘\nd Lord\nd*’, and from_where is_˱he˲ son ˱of˲_him?” And the /a/_great crowd /was/_=> gladly <=_hearing ˱from˲_him.
\v 38 ¶ And in the teaching ˱of˲_him, ˱he˲_/was/_saying, “/Be/_watching_out of the scribes, the \add ones\add* wanting /to_be/_walking in robes, and greetings in the marketplaces,
\v 39 and best_seats in the synagogues, and best_places at the suppers,
\v 40 the \add ones\add* devouring the houses ˱of˲_the widows, and praying long ˱for˲_/a/_under_pretense. These /will_be/_receiving more_excessive judgment.”
\v 41 ¶ And /having/_sat_down in_front_of the treasury, ˱he˲_/was/_observing how the crowd /is/_casting money into the treasury; and many rich /were/_casting much.
\v 42 And /having/_come poor widow one cast two leptons, which is /a/_quadran.
\v 43 And /having/_called_to the disciples ˱of˲_him, ˱he˲_said ˱to˲_them, “Truly, ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all that - this - poor widow, cast more \add than\add* all ˱of˲_the \add ones\add* casting into the treasury.
\v 44 For all cast from the \add wealth\add* abounding ˱to˲_them, but this \add woman\add* ˱she˲_/was/_having cast all out_of the poverty ˱of˲_her as_much_as, all the living ˱of˲_her.”
\c 13
\v 1 ¶ And him going_out out_of the temple, one ˱of˲_the disciples ˱of˲_him /is/_saying ˱to˲_him, “Teacher, behold, what_kind_of stones and what_kind_of buildings!”
\v 2 And - \nd Jesus\nd* said ˱to˲_him, “/Are/_˱you˲_seeing these - great buildings? Stone on stone by_no_means /may_ not _be/_left here, which by_no_means /may_ not _be/_torn_down.”
\v 3 ¶ And ˱of˲_him sitting on the Mount - ˱of˲_Olives in_front_of the temple, Peter, and Jacobus, and John, and Andrew /was/_asking, him by themselves,
\v 4 “Tell ˱to˲_us when these \add things\add* will_be, and what \add is\add* the sign whenever all these \add things\add* /may_be/_going /to_be_being/_completed?”
\v 5 And - \nd Jesus\nd* began /to_be/_saying ˱to˲_them, “/Be/_watching_out, lest anyone /may/_mislead you_all.
\v 6 Many /will_be/_coming in the name ˱of˲_me saying, - ‘I am \add he\add*’, and ˱they˲_/will_be/_misleading many.
\v 7 And whenever ˱you_all˲_/may/_hear ˱of˲_wars and reports ˱of˲_wars, /be_ not _being/_alarmed; ˱it˲_/is/_fitting /to/_become, but \add is\add* not_yet the end.
\v 8 For nation /will_be_being/_raised against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. ˱There˲_will_be earthquakes in places, ˱there˲_will_be famines; these \add are\add* /the/_beginning ˱of˲_birth_pains.
\v 9 ¶ But /be/_watching_out you_all yourselves; ˱they˲_/will_be/_giving_ you_all _over to councils and ˱you_all˲_/will_be_being/_beat in synagogues, and /will_be_being/_stood before governors and kings on_account ˱of˲_me, for /a/_testimony ˱to˲_them.
\v 10 And ˱it˲_/is/_fitting the gospel /to_ first _be/_proclaimed to all the nations.
\v 11 But whenever ˱they˲_/may_be/_bringing you_all giving_over, /be/_=> not <=_worrying_beforehand what ˱you_all˲_/may/_speak, but whatever - /may_be/_given ˱to˲_you_all in that - hour, this /be/_speaking, for you_all are not the \add ones\add* speaking, but the - Holy \nd Spirit\nd*.
\v 12 And brother /will_be/_giving_over brother to death, and father child, and ˱they˲_/will_be/_raising_up children against parents and ˱they˲_/will_be/_putting_ them _to_death.
\v 13 And ˱you_all˲_will_be /being/_hated by all because_of the name ˱of˲_me. But the \add one\add* /having/_endured to /the/_end, this \add one\add* /will_be_being/_saved.
\v 14 ¶ But whenever ˱you_all˲_/may/_see ‘the abomination ˱of˲_the desolation’, /having/_stood where ˱it˲_/is/_=> not <=_fitting, /let_ the \add one\add* reading _be/_understanding, then the \add ones\add* in - Judea, /let_˱them˲_/be_fleeing to the mountains,

\v 17 But woe ˱to˲_the \add women\add* having \add child\add* in womb and ˱to˲_the \add women\add* nursing in those - days!
\v 18 But /be/_praying that ˱it˲_/may/_=> not <=_become ˱in˲_/the/_winter.
\v 19 For - those days will_be tribulation, such_as /has/_=> not <=_become such, from /the/_beginning ˱of˲_creation which - \nd God\nd* created, until the \add time\add* now, and by_no_means /may/_=> not <=_become.
\v 20 And except - /the/_\nd Lord\nd* shortened the days, no any flesh would /was/_saved. But because_of the chosen, whom ˱he˲_chose, ˱he˲_shortened the days.
\v 21 And then if anyone /may/_say ˱to˲_you_all, ‘Behold, here \add is\add* the \nd Messiah\nd*’, or ‘˱Or˲_behold, there’, /be/_=> not <=_believing \add it\add*.
\v 22 For false_messiahs and false_prophets /will_be_being/_raised, and ˱they˲_/will_be/_giving signs and wonders, for that the chosen \add ones\add* if possible /to_be/_wandering_away.
\v 23 But you_all /be/_watching_out; behold, ˱I˲_/have/_previously_spoken all \add things\add* ˱to˲_you_all.
\v 24 ¶ But in those - days, after - that tribulation, ‘the sun /will_be_being/_darkened, and the moon /will_ not _be/_giving the radiance ˱of˲_it’,
\v 25 ‘and the stars will_be falling out_of ˱of˲_the sky’, and the powers - in the heavens /will_be_being/_shaken.
\v 26 And then ˱they˲_/will_be/_seeing ‘the Son - ˱of˲_Man coming in /the/_clouds’, with great power. and glory.
\v 27 And then ˱he˲_/will_be/_sending_out the angels and ˱he˲_/will_be/_gathering_together the chosen \add ones\add* ˱of˲_him, from the four winds, from extremity ˱of˲_/the/_earth to extremity ˱of˲_heaven.
\v 28 ¶ And learn the parable of the fig_tree: whenever the branch ˱of˲_it /may/_become already tender, and /may_be/_sprouting_out the leaves, ˱you_all˲_/are/_knowing that the summer is near.
\v 29 Thus also you_all, whenever ˱you_all˲_/may/_see these \add things\add* becoming, ˱you_all˲_/are/_knowing that ˱it˲_is near at doors.
\v 30 Truly, ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all that by_no_means the this generation /may/_=> not <=_pass_away, until that all these \add things\add* /may/_become.
\v 31 The heaven and the earth /will_be/_passing_away, but the /the/_words ˱of˲_me by_no_means /will_ not _be/_passing_away.
\v 32 ¶ But concerning - that day or - hour, no_one /has/_known, not_even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, except - the Father.
\v 33 /Be/_watching_out, /be/_watching, and /be/_praying, for ˱you_all˲_/have/_=> not <=_known when the time is.
\v 34 Like /a/_man traveling \add it_is\add*, /having/_left the house ˱of˲_him, and /having/_given the authority ˱to˲_the slaves ˱of˲_him, ˱to˲_each the work ˱of˲_him, and ˱to˲_the doorkeeper ˱he˲_commanded that ˱he˲_/may_be/_watching.

\v 1 ¶ And ˱it˲_was the Passover and - Unleavened \add Bread\add* after two days. And the chief_priests and the scribes /were/_seeking, how /having/_apprehended him by deceit, ˱they˲_/may/_kill_off \add him\add*.
\v 2 For ˱they˲_/were/_saying, “Not at the feast, lest will_be /a/_commotion ˱of˲_the people.”
\v 3 ¶ And him being in Bethany, in the house ˱of˲_Simon the leprous, reclining ˱of˲_him, /a/_woman came having /an/_alabaster_flask ˱of˲_ointment, ˱of˲_> genuine expensive <_nard.; /having/_broken the alabaster_flask, ˱she˲_poured_down \add it\add* ˱on˲_the head ˱of˲_him.
\v 4 But some were resenting to themselves, “For why - this destruction ˱of˲_the ointment /has/_become?
\v 5 For this - ointment /was/_able /to_be/_sold ˱for˲_over three_hundred denarii, and /to_be/_given ˱to˲_the poor.” And ˱they˲_/were/_admonishing ˱to˲_her.
\v 6 But - \nd Jesus\nd* said, “Leave her; why /are/_˱you_all˲_bringing_about troubles ˱to˲_her? ˱she˲_did /a/_good work in me.
\v 7 For ˱you_all˲_/are/_=> always <=_having the poor with yourselves, and whenever ˱you_all˲_/may_be/_wanting, ˱you_all˲_/are/_being_able /to/_do well ˱to˲_them, but ˱you_all˲_/are/_=> not always <=_having me.
\v 8 What ˱she˲_had ˱she˲_did, ˱she˲_anticipated /to/_anoint the body ˱of˲_me for my burial.
\v 9 And, truly ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all, wherever the gospel - /may_be/_proclaimed in all the world, what this \add woman\add* did /will_ also, _be_being/_spoken for /a/_memorial ˱of˲_her.”
\v 10 ¶ And Judas Iscariot, - one ˱of˲_the twelve, went_away to the chief_priests, in_order_that ˱he˲_/may/_give_ him _over ˱to˲_them.
\v 11 And they /having/_heard /were/_elated, and ˱they˲_promised /to/_give silver ˱to˲_him. And ˱he˲_/was/_seeking how ˱he˲_/may/_give_ him _over conveniently.
\v 12 ¶ And ˱on˲_the first day - ˱of˲_Unleavened \add Bread\add*, when ˱they˲_/were/_sacrificing the Passover, the disciples ˱of˲_him /are/_saying ˱to˲_him, “Where /are/_˱you˲_wanting /having/_gone_away ˱we˲_/may/_prepare, in_order_that ˱you˲_/may/_eat the Passover?”
\v 13 And ˱he˲_/is/_sending_out two ˱of˲_the disciples ˱of˲_him, and ˱he˲_/is/_saying ˱to˲_them, “/Be/_going into the city, and /a/_man /will_be/_meeting ˱with˲_you_all, bearing /a/_pitcher ˱of˲_water; follow ˱after˲_him.
\v 14 And wherever - ˱he˲_/may/_come_in, say ˱to˲_the /the/_home_owner, - ‘The teacher /is/_saying, “Where is the guest_room ˱of˲_me, where ˱I˲_/may/_eat the Passover with the disciples ˱of˲_me?”’
\v 15 And he /will_be/_showing ˱to˲_you_all /an/_=> large <=_upper_room /having_been/_furnished ready; there prepare ˱for˲_us.”
\v 16 And the disciples came_out, and came into the city, and ˱they˲_found \add it\add* as ˱he˲_said ˱to˲_them, and ˱they˲_prepared the Passover.
\v 17 ¶ And ˱of˲_evening /having/_become, ˱he˲_/is/_coming with the twelve.
\v 18 And them reclining and eating, - \nd Jesus\nd* said, “Truly, ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all that one of you_all /will_be/_giving_ me _over, the \add one\add* eating with me.”
\v 19 ˱They˲_began /to_be_being/_sorrowed, and /to_be/_saying ˱to˲_him one by one, “Surely_not I?”
\v 20 And he said ˱to˲_them, “One ˱of˲_the twelve \add it_is\add*, the \add one\add* dipping_in with me in the bowl.
\v 21 because On_one_hand the /the/_Son - ˱of˲_Man /is/_going, as ˱it˲_/has_been/_written concerning him, on_the_other_hand woe ˱to˲_the man that by whom the Son - ˱of˲_Man /is_being/_given_over; better ˱it˲_was ˱for˲_him if that - man /was/_=> not <=_born.”
\v 22 ¶ And ˱of˲_them eating, /having/_taken bread, /having/_blessed \add it\add*, broke \add it\add* and gave ˱to˲_them, and said, “Take, this is the body ˱of˲_me.”
\v 23 And /having/_taken /the/_cup, /having/_given_thanks, ˱he˲_gave \add it\add* ˱to˲_them, and all drank of it.
\v 24 And ˱he˲_said ˱to˲_them, “This is the blood ˱of˲_the covenant ˱of˲_me, - /being/_poured_out for many.
\v 25 Truly, ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all that by_no_means ˱I˲_/may/_=> not <=_drink of the fruit ˱of˲_the vine, until - that day whenever ˱I˲_/may_be/_drinking it new, in the Kingdom - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*.”
\v 26 ¶ And /having/_sung_hymns, ˱they˲_came_out to the Mount - ˱of˲_Olives.
\v 27 And - \nd Jesus\nd* /is/_saying ˱to˲_them, - “All ˱you_all˲_/will_be_being/_stumbled, because ˱it˲_/has_been/_written, ‘˱I˲_/will_be/_striking the shepherd and the sheep /will_be_being/_scattered.’

\v 29 And - Peter /was/_saying ˱to˲_him, even if all /will_be_being/_stumbled, but not I.”
\v 30 And - \nd Jesus\nd* /is/_saying ˱to˲_him, “Truly, ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you that you today, ˱on˲_this - ˱on˲_night, before /the/_rooster /to/_crow - twice, /will_be/_renouncing me thrice.”
\v 31 But he /was/_saying exceedingly, “If ˱it˲_/may_be/_fitting me /to/_die_together ˱with˲_you, by_no_means ˱I˲_/will_ not _be/_renouncing you.” And all /were/_=> also <=_speaking likewise.
\v 32 ¶ And ˱they˲_/are/_coming to /a/_property, ˱of˲_which the name \add is\add* Gethsemane, and ˱he˲_/is/_saying ˱to˲_the disciples ˱of˲_him, “Sit_down here, until ˱I˲_/may/_pray.”
\v 33 And ˱he˲_/is/_taking - Peter, and - Jacobus, and - John, with him, and began /to_be_being/_greatly_amazed and /to_be/_distressing.
\v 34 And ˱he˲_/is/_saying ˱to˲_them, “The soul ˱of˲_me is very_sorrowful to death; remain here and /be/_watching.”
\v 35 And /having/_gone_ahead /a/_little, ˱he˲_/was/_falling on the ground and ˱he˲_/was/_praying that if possible ˱it˲_is, the hour /may/_pass_by from him.
\v 36 And ˱he˲_/was/_saying, “Abba, - Father, all \add things\add* /are/_possible ˱to˲_you. Take_away - this cup; from me; but not what I /am/_wanting, but what you \add want\add*.”
\v 37 And ˱he˲_/is/_coming and /is/_finding them sleeping, and ˱he˲_/is/_saying - ˱to˲_Peter, “Simon, ˱you˲_/are/_sleeping? Not were_able_˱you˲ /to/_watch one hour?

\v 39 And again /having/_gone_away, ˱he˲_prayed /having/_said the same statement.
\v 40 And /having/_come again, ˱he˲_found them sleeping, for the eyes ˱of˲_them were /being/_weighed_down, and ˱they˲_/had/_=> not <=_known what ˱they˲_/may_be/_answer ˱to˲_him.
\v 41 And ˱he˲_/is/_coming the third \add time\add*, and /is/_saying ˱to˲_them, “/Are/_˱you_all˲_sleeping ˱for˲_the rest and /are/_resting. ˱It˲_/is/_receiving_fully, the hour came. Behold, the Son - ˱of˲_Man /is_being/_given_over into the hands - ˱of˲_sinners.

\v 44 And the \add one\add* giving_ him _over /had/_given /a/_signal ˱to˲_them saying, “Whomever - ˱I˲_/may/_kiss, ˱it˲_is he; apprehend him, and /be/_leading_away securely.”
\v 45 And /having/_come immediately /having/_approached ˱to˲_him, ˱he˲_/is/_saying, “Rabbi”, and ˱he˲_kissed him.
\v 46 And they laid_on the hands ˱of˲_them and apprehended him.
\v 47 But /a/_certain one ˱of˲_the \add ones\add* /having/_stood_by, /having/_drawn the sword, fell the slave ˱of˲_the chief_priest, and ˱he˲_cut_off the ear ˱of˲_him.
\v 48 And - \nd Jesus\nd* answering said ˱to˲_them, ˱you_all˲_came_out with swords and clubs /to/_capture me “As against /a/_robber?
\v 49 In_every day ˱I˲_was with you_all teaching in the temple, and ˱you_all˲_> not <_apprehended me; but \add it_is\add* in_order_that /may_be/_fulfilled the Scriptures.”
\v 50 And /having/_left him, all fled.

\v 54 And - Peter followed ˱after˲_him from afar, as_far_as inside to the courtyard ˱of˲_the chief_priest; and ˱he˲_was sitting_with with the attendants, and warming \add himself\add* at the light \add of_the_fire\add*.
\v 55 And the /the/_chief_priests and all the Sanhedrin /were/_seeking testimony against - \nd Jesus\nd*, in_order that /to/_put_ him _to_death, but ˱they˲_/were/_=> not <=_finding.

\v 59 And neither thus the testimony ˱of˲_them was same.
\v 60 And /having/_stood_up the chief_priest in /the/_midst, asked - \nd Jesus\nd* saying, “Not /are/_˱you˲_answering nothing? What \add is_it\add* these \add men\add* /are/_testifying ˱against˲_you?”
\v 61 But he /was/_keeping_silent, and not answered nothing. Again the chief_priest /was/_asking him, and /is/_saying ˱to˲_him, “You are the \nd Messiah\nd*, the Son the blessed \add one\add*?”
\v 62 And - \nd Jesus\nd* said, “I am. And ˱you_all˲_/will_be/_seeing the Son - ˱of˲_Man ‘on /the/_right \add hand\add* sitting’ ˱of˲_the power, and ‘coming with the clouds ˱of˲_the sky’.”
\v 63 And the chief_priest /having/_torn the clothes ˱of˲_him /is/_saying, “What need anymore /are/_˱we˲_having ˱of˲_witnesses?
\v 64 ˱You_all˲_heard ˱of˲_the slander. What /is/_˱it˲_appearing ˱to˲_you_all?” And the \add ones\add* all condemned him, liable to_be ˱of˲_death.
\v 65 And some began /to_be/_spitting ˱on˲_him, and /to_be/_blindfolding the face ˱of˲_him, and /to_be/_beating him, and /to_be/_saying ˱to˲_him, “Prophesy!” And the attendants received him ˱with˲_slaps.
\v 66 ¶ And - Peter being below in the courtyard, one ˱of˲_the servant_girls ˱of˲_the chief_priest /is/_coming,

\v 69 And the servant_girl /having/_seen him, began again /to_be/_saying ˱to˲_the \add ones\add* /having/_stood_by, - “He is of them.”
\v 70 But again he /was/_disowning \add him\add*. And after /a/_little, again the \add ones\add* /having/_stood_by /were/_saying - ˱to˲_Peter, “Truly ˱you˲_are from them, for ˱you˲_are also /a/_Galilean”,
\v 71 but he began /to_be/_cursing and /to_be/_swearing, - “˱I˲_/have/_=> not <=_known - this man, whom ˱you_all˲_/are/_speaking!”
\v 72 And immediately for /the/_second \add time\add* /a/_rooster crowed. And - Peter /was/_reminded the word as - \nd Jesus\nd* said ˱to˲_him, - “before /the/_rooster /to/_crow thrice ˱you˲_/will_be/_renouncing me”, and /having/_broken_down, ˱he˲_/was/_weeping.
\c 15
\v 1 ¶ And immediately in_the_morning, the chief_priests /having/_established /a/_counsel, with the elders and scribes, and all the Sanhedrin, /having/_bound - \nd Jesus\nd*, ˱they˲_carried_away \add him\add* and ˱they˲_gave_over \add him\add* ˱to˲_Pilate.
\v 2 And - Pilate asked him, “Are you the King ˱of˲_the Jews?” And he answering ˱to˲_him /is/_saying, “You /are/_saying \add it\add*.”
\v 3 And the chief_priests /were/_accusing many \add things\add* ˱against˲_him.
\v 4 And - Pilate again asked him saying, “Not ˱you˲_/are/_answering nothing? Behold, how_many \add things\add* ˱they˲_/are/_accusing ˱against˲_you!”
\v 5 But - \nd Jesus\nd* no_longer answered nothing, so_as - Pilate /to_be/_marveling.

\v 8 And /having/_gone_up, the crowd began /to_be/_requesting as ˱he˲_/was/_doing ˱for˲_them.
\v 9 But - Pilate answered ˱to˲_them saying, “/Are/_˱you_all˲_wanting ˱I˲_/may/_send_away ˱to˲_you_all the King ˱of˲_the Jews?”
\v 10 for ˱He˲_/was/_knowing that the chief_priests /had/_given_ him _over because_of envy.
\v 11 But the chief_priests stirred_up the crowd, in_order_that ˱he˲_/may/_=> rather <=_send_away - Barabbas ˱to˲_them.
\v 12 And - Pilate again answering /was/_saying ˱to˲_them, “Therefore what ˱I˲_/may/_do which ˱you_all˲_/are/_calling the King ˱of˲_the Jews?”
\v 13 And they cried_out again, “Crucify him!”
\v 14 And - Pilate /was/_saying ˱to˲_them, “For what evil ˱he˲_did?” But they exceedingly cried_out, “Crucify him!”
\v 15 And - Pilate wishing /to/_do - much ˱for˲_the crowd, sent_ - Barabbas _away ˱to˲_them, and gave_ - \nd Jesus\nd* _over /having/_flogged \add him\add*, in_order_that ˱he˲_/may_be/_crucified.
\v 16 ¶ And the soldiers led_ him _away within the palace, that is /the/_praetorium, and ˱they˲_/are/_calling_together all the cohort.
\v 17 And ˱they˲_/are/_dressing_ him _in purple, and /having/_twisted_together /a/_thorny crown ˱they˲_/are/_putting_around ˱to˲_him,
\v 18 and ˱they˲_began /to_be/_greeting him, “Hail, King ˱of˲_the Jews!”
\v 19 And ˱they˲_/were/_striking the head ˱of˲_him ˱with˲_/a/_staff, and ˱they˲_/were/_spitting ˱on˲_him, and kneeling the knees, ˱they˲_/were/_worshipping ˱before˲_him.
\v 20 And when ˱they˲_mocked ˱at˲_him, ˱they˲_stripped_ the purple \add garment\add* _off him, and ˱they˲_dressed_ him _in the own clothes ˱of˲_him. And ˱they˲_/are/_leading_ him _out, in_order_that ˱they˲_/may/_crucify him.
\v 21 ¶ And ˱they˲_/are/_compelling /a/_certain \add man\add* passing_by Simon Cyrenian, coming from /the/_country, the father ˱of˲_Alexander and Rufus, in_order_that ˱he˲_/may/_carry the cross ˱of˲_him.
\v 22 And ˱they˲_/are/_bringing him to the Golgotha, place which is /being/_translated, “˱of˲_/the/_Skull Place”.
\v 23 And ˱they˲_/were/_giving ˱to˲_him, wine /having_been/_mixed_with_myrrh, but which ˱he˲_> not <_took.
\v 24 And /having/_crucified him, ˱they˲_/are/_dividing the clothes ˱of˲_him, casting lot for them, ˱and˲_who /may/_take_ what _away.
\v 25 ¶ And ˱it˲_was /the/_=> third <=_hour, and ˱they˲_crucified him.
\v 26 And the inscription ˱of˲_the charge ˱of˲_him /having_been/_inscribed was, “the King ˱of˲_the Jews.”
\v 27 And with him ˱they˲_/are/_crucifying two robbers, one on /the/_right and one on /the/_left ˱of˲_him.
\v 28
\v 29 And the \add ones\add* passing_through /were/_slandering him, shaking the heads ˱of˲_them, and saying, “Aha, you tearing_down the temple and building \add it\add* in three days,
\v 30 save yourself, /having/_come_down from the cross!”
\v 31 Likewise also the chief_priests, mocking to one_another with the scribes /were/_saying, “˱He˲_saved others, ˱he˲_/is/_=> not <=_able /to/_save himself.
\v 32 The \nd Messiah\nd*, the King ˱of˲_Israel /let/_come_down now from the cross, in_order_that ˱we˲_/may/_see and ˱we˲_/may/_believe!” And the \add ones\add* /having_been/_crucified_with with him /were/_deriding him.
\v 33 ¶ And /having/_become /the/_=> sixth <=_hour, darkness became over all the land, until /the/_=> ninth <=_hour.
\v 34 And - ninth hour, - \nd Jesus\nd* shouted ˱with˲_/a/_=> loud <=_voice, “Eloi, Eloi, lema sabachthani?” Which is /being/_translated, “the \nd God\nd* ˱of˲_me, the \nd God\nd* ˱of˲_me, for why ˱you˲_abandoned me?”
\v 35 And some ˱of˲_the \add ones\add* /having/_stood, /having/_heard /were/_saying, “Behold, ˱he˲_/is/_calling Elijah.”
\v 36 And someone /having/_run, and /having/_filled /a/_sponge ˱with˲_wine_vinegar /having/_put_around ˱around˲_/a/_reed, /was/_giving_ him _to_drink saying, “Leave \add it\add*, ˱we˲_/may/_see if Elijah /is/_coming /to/_take_ him _down.”
\v 37 And - \nd Jesus\nd* /having/_left ˱with˲_/a/_=> loud <=_cry, expired.
\v 38 And the curtain ˱of˲_the temple /was/_torn into two, from top to bottom.
\v 39 And the centurion /having/_seen - /having/_stood_by from opposite ˱of˲_him that ˱he˲_expired thus said, “Truly this - man was /the/_Son ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*!”
\v 40 ¶ And were also women observing from afar, among whom both Mary the Magdalene, and Mary the mother ˱of˲_Jacobus the little and ˱of˲_Joses, and Salome,
\v 41 who /were/_following ˱after˲_him when ˱he˲_was in - Galilee and /were/_serving ˱unto˲_him, and many others - /having/_come_up_with ˱to˲_him to Jerusalem.

\v 44 And - Pilate wondered if ˱he˲_/has/_=> already <=_died, and /having/_called_to the centurion, ˱he˲_asked him whether ˱he˲_> already <_died_off.
\v 45 And /having/_known from the centurion, ˱he˲_granted the corpse - ˱to˲_Joseph.
\v 46 And /having/_bought /a/_linen_cloth, /having/_taken_ him _down, ˱he˲_wrapped_in ˱in˲_the linen_cloth, and laid him in /a/_tomb which was /having_been/_hewn out_of /a/_rock, and rolled /a/_stone to the door ˱of˲_the tomb.
\v 47 And - Mary the Magdalene, and Mary the \add mother\add* ˱of˲_Joses, /were/_observing where ˱he˲_/has_been/_laid.

\v 2 And exceedingly early first ˱of˲_the ˱of˲_/the/_week, ˱they˲_/are/_coming to the tomb, the sun /having/_risen.
\v 3 And ˱they˲_/were/_saying to themselves, “Who /will_be/_rolling_away ˱for˲_us the stone out_of the door ˱of˲_the tomb?”
\v 4 And /having/_looked_up ˱they˲_/are/_observing that the stone /has_been/_rolled_away. for ˱it˲_was exceedingly large.
\v 5 And /having/_come_in into the tomb, ˱they˲_saw /a/_young_man sitting on the right, /having/_clothed ˱with˲_/a/_=> white <=_robe, and ˱they˲_/were/_greatly_amazed.
\v 6 And he /is/_saying ˱to˲_them, “/Be_ not _being/_greatly_amazed. ˱you_all˲_/are/_seeking \nd Jesus\nd* the Nazarean, the \add one\add* /having_been/_crucified. ˱He˲_/was/_raised! ˱He˲_is not here; behold, the place where ˱they˲_laid him.
\v 7 But /be/_going, say ˱to˲_the disciples ˱of˲_him and - ˱to˲_Peter, - ‘˱He˲_/is/_going_before you_all into - Galilee; there ˱you_all˲_/will_be/_seeing him, as ˱he˲_said ˱to˲_you_all.’”
\v 8 And /having/_come_out, ˱they˲_fled from the tomb, for trembling and amazement /was/_having them, and spoke nothing ˱to˲_no_one, for ˱they˲_/were/_fearing.
