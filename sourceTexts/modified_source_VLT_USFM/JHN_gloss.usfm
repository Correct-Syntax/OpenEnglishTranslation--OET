\v 1 ¶ In /the/_beginning was the word, and the word was with - \nd God\nd*, and \nd God\nd* was the word.
\v 2 This \add one\add* was in /the/_beginning with - \nd God\nd*.
\v 3 All \add things\add* became through him, and without him not_even one \add thing\add* became that /has/_become.
\v 4 In him was life, and the life was the light - ˱of˲_mankind.
\v 5 And the light in the darkness /is/_shining, and it grasped not the darkness.
\v 6 ¶ Became /a/_man /having_been/_sent_out from \nd God\nd*, John /the/_name ˱to˲_him \add was\add*.
\v 7 This \add one\add* came for /a/_testimony, in_order_that ˱he˲_/may/_testify concerning the light, in_order_that all /may/_believe through him.
\v 8 That \add one\add* was not the light, but in_order_that ˱he˲_/may/_testify concerning the light.
\v 9 ˱It˲_was the - true light, which /is/_enlightening every person, coming into the world.
\v 10 ¶ ˱He˲_was in the world, and the world became through him, and the world knew not him.
\v 11 ˱He˲_came to his own, and his own not received him.
\v 12 But as_many_as received him, ˱he˲_gave ˱to˲_them /the/_right /to/_become children ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*, ˱to˲_the \add ones\add* believing in the name ˱of˲_him,
\v 13 who neither of bloods, nor of will ˱of˲_flesh, nor of will ˱of˲_man, but /were/_become of \nd God\nd*.
\v 14 ¶ And the word became flesh and sheltered among us, and ˱we˲_saw the glory ˱of˲_him, /a/_glory as ˱of˲_/an/_only_begotten with /a/_father, full ˱of˲_grace and truth.
\v 15 John /is/_testifying concerning him, and ˱he˲_/has/_cried_out saying, “This \add one\add* was whom ˱I˲_said, ‘The \add one\add* coming after me, /has/_become before ˱of˲_me, because ˱he˲_was before me.’”
\v 16 Because of the fullness ˱of˲_him, we all received and grace for grace.
\v 17 Because the law /was/_given through Moses, - grace and - truth became through \nd Jesus\nd* \nd Christ\nd*.
\v 18 No_one /has/_=> ever <=_seen \nd God\nd*; /the/_only_begotten \nd God\nd*, the \add one\add* being in the bosom ˱of˲_the Father, that \add one\add* explained \add him\add*.
\v 19 ¶ And this is the testimony - ˱of˲_John, when the Jews sent_out priests and Levites from Jerusalem, in_order_that ˱they˲_/may/_ask “him, “Who are you?”
\v 20 And ˱he˲_confessed and not disowned, but confessed, - “I am not the \nd Messiah\nd*.”
\v 21 And ˱they˲_asked him, what therefore You are Elijah?” And ˱he˲_/is/_saying, “˱I˲_am not.” “Are you the prophet?” And ˱he˲_answered, “No.”
\v 22 Therefore ˱they˲_said ˱to˲_him, “Who ˱you˲_are? In_order_that ˱we˲_/may/_give /an/_answer ˱to˲_the \add ones\add* /having/_sent us. What ˱you˲_/are/_saying about yourself?”
\v 23 ˱He˲_/was/_saying, “I \add am\add* ‘/a/_voice shouting in the desert: “Straighten the way ˱of˲_/the/_\nd Lord\nd*”’, as Isaiah the prophet said.”
\v 24 ¶ And /having_been/_sent_out ˱they˲_were from the Pharisees.
\v 25 And ˱they˲_asked him and ˱they˲_said ˱to˲_him, “Therefore why ˱you˲_/are/_baptizing, if you not are the \nd Messiah\nd*, nor Elijah, nor the prophet?”
\v 26 - John answered ˱to˲_them saying, “I /am/_baptizing with water; ˱in˲_/the/_midst ˱of˲_you_all ˱one˲_/has/_stood whom you_all not /have/_known,
\v 27 the \add one\add* coming after me, ˱of˲_whom not am I worthy, that ˱I˲_/may/_untie the strap ˱of˲_the sandal ˱of˲_him.”
\v 28 These \add things\add* became in Bethany, beyond the Jordan, where - John was baptizing.
\v 29 ¶ ˱On˲_the \add day\add* of_next ˱he˲_/is/_seeing - \nd Jesus\nd* coming to him, and /is/_saying, “Behold, the Lamb - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*, - taking_away the sin ˱of˲_the world.
\v 30 This \add one\add* ˱it˲_is concerning whom I said, ‘After me /is/_coming /a/_man, who /has/_become before me, because ˱he˲_was before me.’
\v 31 And_I /had/_=> not <=_known him, but in_order_that /may_be/_revealed - ˱to˲_Israel because_of this, I came baptizing with water.”
\v 32 And John testified saying, - “˱I˲_/have/_seen the \nd Spirit\nd* coming_down as /a/_dove out_of heaven, and ˱it˲_remained on him.
\v 33 And_I /had/_=> not <=_known him, but the \add one\add* /having/_sent me /to_be/_baptizing with water, that \add one\add* said ˱to˲_me, ‘On whom - ˱you˲_/may/_see the \nd Spirit\nd* coming_down and remaining on him, he is the \add one\add* baptizing with /the/_=> Holy <=_\nd Spirit\nd*.’
\v 34 And_I /have/_seen and /have/_testified that this is the Son - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*.”
\v 35 ¶ ˱On˲_the \add day\add* of_next again - John /had/_stood, and two of the disciples ˱of˲_him.
\v 36 And /having/_focused_in - ˱on˲_\nd Jesus\nd* walking ˱he˲_/is/_saying, “Behold, the Lamb - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*!”
\v 37 And the two disciples ˱of˲_him heard speaking, and ˱they˲_followed - ˱after˲_\nd Jesus\nd*.
\v 38 But - \nd Jesus\nd* /having_been/_turned, and /having/_seen them following, ˱he˲_/is/_saying ˱to˲_them, “What ˱you_all˲_/are/_seeking?” And they said ˱to˲_him, “Rabbi” (which /is_being/_called /being/_translated, “Teacher”), “Where ˱you˲_/are/_remaining?”
\v 39 ˱He˲_/is/_saying ˱to˲_them, “/Be/_coming and ˱you_all˲_/will_be/_seeing.” Therefore ˱they˲_came and saw where ˱he˲_/is/_remaining, and ˱they˲_remained with him - that day; /the/_hour was about /the/_tenth.
\v 40 Andrew the brother ˱of˲_Simon Peter was, one of the two - /having/_heard from John, and /having/_followed ˱after˲_him.
\v 41 This \add one\add* first /is/_finding the his own brother Simon, and /is/_saying ˱to˲_him, “˱We˲_/have/_found the Messiah”, (which is /being/_translated, “/the/_\nd Anointed|Christ\nd*”).
\v 42 ˱he˲_led him to - \nd Jesus\nd*. /Having/_focused_in ˱on˲_him, - \nd Jesus\nd* said, “You are Simon the son ˱of˲_John, you /will_be_being/_called Cephas”, (which /is_being/_translated, “/the/_Stone|Peter”).
\v 43 ¶ ˱On˲_the \add day\add* of_next ˱he˲_wanted /to/_come_out into - Galilee. And ˱he˲_/is/_finding Philip, and \nd Jesus\nd* /is/_saying ˱to˲_him -, “/Be/_following ˱after˲_me.”
\v 44 And - Philip was from Bethsaida, of the city ˱of˲_Andrew and Peter.
\v 45 Philip /is/_finding - Nathanael, and ˱he˲_/is/_saying ˱to˲_him, “˱We˲_/have/_found whom wrote Moses in the law and the prophets, \nd Jesus\nd* son - ˱of˲_Joseph, who \add is\add* from Nazareth.”
\v 46 And Nathanael said ˱to˲_him, “/Is/_able any good to_be out_of Nazareth?” - Philip /is/_saying ˱to˲_him, “/Be/_coming and see.”
\v 47 - \nd Jesus\nd* saw - Nathanael coming to him and ˱he˲_/is/_saying concerning him, “Behold, truly /an/_Israelite in whom is not deceit.”
\v 48 Nathanael /is/_saying ˱to˲_him, “From_where ˱you˲_/are/_knowing me?” \nd Jesus\nd* answered and said ˱to˲_him, “Before the \add time\add* Philip /to/_call you, being under the fig_tree, ˱I˲_saw you.”
\v 49 Nathanael answered ˱to˲_him, “Rabbi, you are the Son - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*, you are King - ˱of˲_Israel.”
\v 50 \nd Jesus\nd* answered and said ˱to˲_him, “Because ˱I˲_said ˱to˲_you that ˱I˲_saw you beneath the fig_tree, ˱you˲_/are/_believing? ˱You˲_/will_be/_seeing greater \add than\add* these \add things\add*.”
\v 51 And ˱he˲_/is/_saying ˱to˲_him, “Truly, truly, ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all, ˱you_all˲_/will_be/_seeing - heaven /having/_opened_up, and the angels - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd* going_up and coming_down on the Son - ˱of˲_Man.”
\c 2
\v 1 ¶ And ˱on˲_the - third day /a/_wedding became in Cana - ˱of˲_Galilee, and the mother - ˱of˲_\nd Jesus\nd* was there.
\v 2 And - \nd Jesus\nd* /was/_=> also <=_invited and the disciples ˱of˲_him to the wedding.
\v 3 And /having/_been_deficient ˱of˲_wine, the mother - ˱of˲_\nd Jesus\nd* /is/_saying to him, “˱They˲_/are/_=> not <=_having wine.”
\v 4 And - \nd Jesus\nd* /is/_saying ˱to˲_her, “What ˱to˲_me and ˱to˲_you, woman? The hour ˱of˲_me /is/_=> not_yet <=_coming.”
\v 5 The mother ˱of˲_him /is/_saying ˱to˲_the servants, “Do whatever anything - ˱he˲_/may_be/_saying ˱to˲_you_all.”
\v 6 And six stone waterpots were lying there according_to the purification ˱of˲_the Jews, having_room_for two or three measures each.
\v 7 /Is/_saying ˱to˲_them - \nd Jesus\nd*, “Fill the waterpots ˱with˲_water.” And ˱they˲_filled them to upward.
\v 8 And ˱he˲_/is/_saying ˱to˲_them, “Draw now and /be/_carrying ˱to˲_the /the/_headwaiter.” And they carried \add it\add*.
\v 9 And when the /the/_headwaiter tasted the water /having_been/_become wine, and /had/_=> not <=_known from_where is, but the servants /had/_known the \add ones\add* /having/_drawn the water, the headwaiter /is/_calling the bridegroom
\v 10 and ˱he˲_/is/_saying ˱to˲_him, “Every person /is/_presenting first the good wine, and the lessor whenever ˱they˲_/may_be/_being_drunk; you /have/_kept the good wine until now.”
\v 11 This beginning ˱of˲_the signs - \nd Jesus\nd* did in Cana - ˱of˲_Galilee, and revealed the glory ˱of˲_him, and the disciples ˱of˲_him believed in him.
\v 12 ¶ After this ˱he˲_came_down to Capernaum, he and the mother ˱of˲_him, and the brothers and the disciples ˱of˲_him, and ˱they˲_remained there not many days.
\v 13 ¶ And the Passover ˱of˲_the Jews was near, and - \nd Jesus\nd* went_up to Jerusalem.
\v 14 And ˱he˲_found in the temple the \add ones\add* selling oxen and sheep and doves, and the money-changers sitting.
\v 15 And /having/_made as /a/_whip of cords, all ˱he˲_cast_out both the sheep and - oxen from the temple, and ˱he˲_poured_out the coins ˱of˲_the moneychangers, and ˱he˲_overturned the tables.
\v 16 And ˱to˲_the \add ones\add* selling - doves ˱he˲_said, “Take_away these \add things\add* from_here, not /be/_making the house ˱of˲_the father ˱of˲_me /a/_house ˱of˲_business.”
\v 17 the disciples ˱of˲_him /Were/_reminded that /having_been/_written ˱it˲_is, “the zeal ˱of˲_the house ˱of˲_you /will_be/_consuming me.”
\v 18 Therefore the Jews answered and said ˱to˲_him, “What sign ˱you˲_/are/_showing ˱to˲_us, that ˱you˲_/are/_doing these \add things\add*?”
\v 19 \nd Jesus\nd* answered and said ˱to˲_them, “Destroy this the temple, and ˱I˲_/will_be/_raising it in three days.”
\v 20 Therefore the Jews said, “This - temple /was/_built ˱for˲_forty and six years, and you /will_be/_raising it in three days?”
\v 21 But that \add one\add* /was/_speaking concerning the temple ˱of˲_the body ˱of˲_him.
\v 22 Therefore when ˱he˲_/was/_raised from /the/_dead, the disciples ˱of˲_him /were/_reminded that ˱he˲_/was/_saying this, and ˱they˲_believed ˱in˲_the Scripture and the word that - \nd Jesus\nd* spoke.
\v 23 ¶ And when ˱he˲_was in - Jerusalem at the Passover at the feast, many believed on the name ˱of˲_him, observing ˱of˲_him the signs which ˱he˲_/was/_doing.
\v 24 But \nd Jesus\nd* himself not /was/_entrusting himself ˱to˲_them, because_of that him /to_be/_knowing all \add men\add*.
\v 25 And that ˱he˲_/was/_having no need that anyone /may/_testify concerning - mankind, for he /was/_knowing what was in the person.
\c 3
\v 1 ¶ And was /a/_man of the Pharisees, Nicodemus /the/_name ˱to˲_him, /a/_ruler ˱of˲_the Jews;
\v 2 this \add one\add* came to him ˱by˲_night, and said ˱to˲_him, “Rabbi, ˱we˲_/have/_known that ˱you˲_/have/_come from \nd God\nd* ˱as˲_/a/_teacher; for no_one /is/_able /to_be/_doing these - signs, what you /are/_doing, if - \nd God\nd* not may_be with him.”
\v 3 \nd Jesus\nd* answered and said ˱to˲_him, “Truly, truly, ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you, if anyone not /may_be/_born again, ˱he˲_/is/_=> not <=_able /to/_see the Kingdom - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*.”
\v 4 Nicodemus /is/_saying to him, “How /is/_=> /a/_person <=_able /to_be/_born, being old? ˱He˲_/is/_=> not <=_able /to/_come_in into the womb ˱of˲_the mother ˱of˲_him secondly and /to_be/_born?”
\v 5 \nd Jesus\nd* answered, “Truly, truly, ˱I˲_/am/_telling ˱to˲_you, if anyone not /may_be/_born of water and ˱of˲_\nd Spirit\nd*, ˱he˲_/is/_=> not <=_able /to/_come_in into the Kingdom - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*.
\v 6 The \add thing\add* /having_been/_born of the flesh, is flesh, and the \add thing\add* /having_been/_born of the \nd Spirit\nd*, is spirit.
\v 7 ˱You˲_/may/_=> not <=_wonder that ˱I˲_said ˱to˲_you, ‘˱It˲_/is/_fitting you_all /to_be/_born again.’
\v 8 The spirit ˱it˲_/is/_blowing where /is/_wanting, and ˱you˲_/are/_hearing the sound ˱of˲_it, but ˱you˲_/have/_=> not <=_known from_where ˱it˲_/is/_coming, and where ˱it˲_/is/_going; thus is everyone - /having_been/_born of the \nd Spirit\nd*.”
\v 9 Nicodemus answered and said ˱to˲_him, “How /is/_=> these \add things\add* <=_able /to/_become?”
\v 10 \nd Jesus\nd* answered and said ˱to˲_him, “You are the teacher - ˱of˲_Israel, and ˱you˲_/are/_=> not <=_knowing these \add things\add*?
\v 11 Truly, truly, ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you that ˱we˲_/are/_speaking what ˱we˲_/have/_known, and ˱we˲_/are/_testifying what ˱we˲_/have/_seen, and ˱you_all˲_/are/_=> not <=_receiving the testimony ˱of˲_us.
\v 12 If ˱I˲_told the earthly \add things\add* ˱to˲_you_all, and ˱you_all˲_/are/_=> not <=_believing, how ˱you_all˲_/will_be/_believing if ˱I˲_/may/_tell ˱to˲_you_all the heavenly \add things\add*?
\v 13 And no_one /has/_gone_up into - heaven, except - the \add one\add* /having/_come_down out_of - heaven– the Son - ˱of˲_Man.
\v 14 And as Moses exalted the serpent in the desert, thus ˱it˲_/is/_fitting the Son - ˱of˲_Man /to_be/_exalted,
\v 15 in_order_that everyone - believing in him /may_be/_having eternal life.
\v 16 ¶ For thus - \nd God\nd* loved the world, so_that ˱he˲_gave the - only_begotten Son, in_order_that everyone - believing in him /may/_=> not <=_perish, but /may_be/_having eternal life.
\v 17 For - \nd God\nd* not sent_out his Son into the world, in_order_that ˱he˲_/may/_judge the world, but in_order_that the world /may_be/_saved through him.
\v 18 The \add one\add* believing in him not /is_being/_judged. But the \add one\add* not believing, /has_been/_=> already <=_judged, because ˱he˲_/has/_=> not <=_believed in the name ˱of˲_the only_begotten Son - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*.
\v 19 And this is the judgment, that - light /has/_come into the world, and - people loved the darkness rather than the light, for the works ˱of˲_them was evil.
\v 20 For everyone - doing evil, /is/_hating the light, and /is/_=> not <=_coming to the light, in_order_that the works ˱of˲_him /may_be/_=> not <=_rebuked.
\v 21 But the \add one\add* practicing the truth, /is/_coming to the light, in_order_that the works ˱of˲_him /may_be/_revealed, that ˱it˲_is /having_been/_worked in \nd God\nd*.”
\v 22 ¶ After these \add things\add* - and \nd Jesus\nd* the disciples ˱of˲_him came into the Judean land, and there ˱he˲_/was/_staying with them and /was/_baptizing.
\v 23 And - John was also baptizing in Aenon near - Salim, because much water was there, and ˱they˲_/were/_arriving and /were_being/_baptized.
\v 24 For - John was not_yet /having_been/_cast into the prison.
\v 25 ¶ Therefore became /a/_debate of the disciples ˱of˲_John with /a/_Jew about purification.
\v 26 And ˱they˲_came to - John and ˱they˲_said ˱to˲_him, “Rabbi, who was with you beyond the Jordan, ˱to˲_whom you /have/_testified, behold, this \add one\add* /is/_baptizing and all /are/_coming to him.”
\v 27 John answered and said, “/A/_person /is/_=> not <=_able /to_be/_receiving, not_even one if not ˱it˲_may_be /having_been/_given ˱to˲_him from - heaven.
\v 28 Yourselves you_all /are/_testifying ˱to˲_me that ˱I˲_said, ‘I am not the \nd Messiah\nd*’, but, - ‘/Having_been/_sent_out ˱I˲_am before that \add one\add*.’
\v 29 The \add one\add* having the bride, is /the/_bridegroom; but the friend ˱of˲_the bridegroom, the \add one\add* /having/_stood and hearing ˱from˲_him, /is/_rejoicing ˱with˲_joy because_of the voice ˱of˲_the bridegroom. Therefore this - my - joy /has_been/_fulfilled.
\v 30 That \add one\add* ˱it˲_/is/_fitting /to_be/_increasing, but me /to_be/_being_made_less.
\v 31 ¶ The \add one\add* coming from_above, is above all. The \add one\add* being from the earth, is from the earth, and /is/_speaking from the earth. The \add one\add* coming from - heaven, is above all.
\v 32 What ˱he˲_/has/_seen and heard, this ˱he˲_/is/_testifying, but no_one /is/_receiving the testimony ˱of˲_him.
\v 33 The \add one\add* /having/_received ˱of˲_him the testimony, ˱he˲_sealed that - \nd God\nd* is true.
\v 34 For whom - \nd God\nd* sent_out, /is/_speaking the words - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*, for ˱he˲_/is/_giving the \nd Spirit\nd* not by measure.
\v 35 The Father /is/_loving the Son, and /has/_given all \add things\add* in the hand ˱of˲_him.
\v 36 The \add one\add* believing in the Son, /is/_having eternal life; but the \add one\add* disbelieving ˱in˲_the Son, not /will_be/_seeing life, but the wrath - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd* /is/_remaining on him.”
\c 4
\v 1 ¶ Therefore when the \nd Lord\nd* knew that the Pharisees heard that \nd Jesus\nd* /is/_making and /is/_baptizing more disciples than John
\v 2 (and_yet_indeed \nd Jesus\nd* himself /was/_=> not <=_baptizing, but the disciples ˱of˲_him),
\v 3 ˱he˲_left - Judea and went_away again into - Galilee.
\v 4 And ˱it˲_/was/_fitting him /to_be/_passing_through through - Samaria.
\v 5 Therefore ˱he˲_/is/_coming to /a/_city - ˱of˲_Samaria /being/_called Sychar, near the property which Jacob gave - ˱to˲_Joseph, the son ˱of˲_him;
\v 6 and well - ˱of˲_Jacob was there. Therefore - \nd Jesus\nd* /having/_wearied from the journey, /was/_sitting thus at the well. /The/_hour was about /the/_sixth.
\v 7 /a/_woman out_of - Samaria /is/_coming /to/_draw water. - \nd Jesus\nd* /is/_saying ˱to˲_her, “Give ˱to˲_me /to/_drink”;
\v 8 for the disciples ˱of˲_him /had/_gone_away into the city, in_order_that ˱they˲_/may/_buy food.
\v 9 Therefore the - Samaritan woman /is/_saying ˱to˲_him, “How you being /a/_Jew, /are/_requesting /to/_drink from me ˱of˲_/a/_woman being Samaritan?” For Jews /are/_=> not <=_having_association_with ˱with˲_Samaritans.
\v 10 \nd Jesus\nd* answered and said ˱to˲_her, “If ˱you˲_/had/_known the gift - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*, and who is - saying ˱to˲_you, ‘Give ˱to˲_me /to/_drink’, you would requested him, and ˱he˲_> would <_gave ˱to˲_you living water.”
\v 11 The woman /is/_saying ˱to˲_him, “Sir, neither ˱you˲_/are/_having bucket and the well is deep; therefore from_where ˱you˲_/are/_having the - living water?
\v 12 You are not greater \add than\add* the father ˱of˲_us Jacob, who /has/_given the well ˱to˲_us, and drank of it himself, and the sons ˱of˲_him, and the livestock ˱of˲_him?”
\v 13 \nd Jesus\nd* answered and said ˱to˲_her, “Everyone - drinking of the this water, /will_be/_thirsting again;
\v 14 but whoever - /may/_drink of the water that I /will_be/_giving ˱to˲_him, by_no_means /will_ not _be/_thirsting, for the age, but the water that ˱I˲_/will_be/_giving ˱to˲_him /will_be/_becoming in him /a/_spring ˱of˲_water, springing_up into eternal life.”
\v 15 The woman /is/_saying to him, “Sir, give this - water ˱to˲_me, in_order_that ˱I˲_/may_ not _be/_thirsting, nor ˱I˲_/am/_passing_through here /to_be/_drawing.”
\v 16 ¶ ˱He˲_/is/_saying ˱to˲_her, “/Be/_going, call the husband ˱of˲_you and come here.”
\v 17 The woman answered and said ˱to˲_him, “˱I˲_/am/_=> not <=_having /a/_husband.” - \nd Jesus\nd* /is/_saying ˱to˲_her, “˱You˲_said rightly, - ‘˱I˲_/am/_=> not <=_having /a/_husband’;
\v 18 for ˱you˲_had five husbands, and now ˱he˲_whom ˱you˲_/are/_having, is not husband ˱of˲_you; this ˱you˲_/have/_spoken true.”
\v 19 The woman /is/_saying ˱to˲_him, “Sir, ˱I˲_/am/_perceiving that you are /a/_prophet.
\v 20 The fathers ˱of˲_us worshipped on - this mountain, and you_all /are/_saying that in Jerusalem is the place where ˱it˲_/is/_fitting /to_be/_worshipping.”
\v 21 - \nd Jesus\nd* /is/_saying ˱to˲_her, “/Be/_believing ˱in˲_me, woman, because /an/_hour /is/_coming, when neither on - this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, /will_˱you_all˲_/be_worshipping ˱before˲_the Father.
\v 22 You_all /are/_worshipping what ˱you_all˲_/have/_=> not <=_known, we /are/_worshipping what ˱we˲_/have/_known, because - salvation is of the Jews.
\v 23 But /an/_hour /is/_coming and now is, when the true worshipers /will_be/_worshipping ˱before˲_the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father also /is/_seeking such, the \add ones\add* worshipping him.
\v 24 - \nd God\nd* \add is\add* \nd Spirit\nd*, and the \add ones\add* worshipping him ˱it˲_/is/_fitting in spirit and truth.” /to_be/_worshipping.”
\v 25 The woman /is/_saying ˱to˲_him, “˱I˲_/have/_known that /the/_Messiah /is/_coming, who \add is\add* /being/_called ‘/the/_\nd Anointed|Christ\nd*’; whenever that \add one\add* /may/_come, ˱he˲_/will_be/_declaring all \add things\add* ˱to˲_us.”
\v 26 - \nd Jesus\nd* /is/_saying ˱to˲_her, “I am \add he\add*, the \add one\add* speaking ˱to˲_you.”
\v 27 ¶ And after this the disciples ˱of˲_him came, and ˱they˲_/were/_marveling that ˱he˲_/was/_speaking with /a/_woman; however no_one said, “What /are/_˱you˲_seeking?” Or, “Why /are/_˱you˲_speaking with her?”
\v 28 Therefore the woman left the waterpot ˱of˲_her, and ˱she˲_went_away into the city, and ˱she˲_/is/_saying ˱to˲_the people,
\v 29 “Come, see /a/_man who told ˱to˲_me all \add things\add* as_much_as ˱I˲_did; surely_not this is the \nd Messiah\nd*?”
\v 30 ˱They˲_came_out out_of the city, and ˱they˲_/were/_coming to him.
\v 31 ¶ In the \add time\add* meanwhile the disciples /were/_asking him saying, “Rabbi, eat.”
\v 32 But he said ˱to˲_them, “I /am/_having food /to/_eat, that you_all /have/_=> not <=_known.”
\v 33 Therefore the disciples /were/_saying to one_another, “Not anyone brought ˱to˲_him \add something\add* /to/_eat?”
\v 34 - \nd Jesus\nd* /is/_saying ˱to˲_them, “My food is that ˱I˲_/may/_do the will ˱of˲_the \add one\add* /having/_sent me, and ˱I˲_/may/_complete the work ˱of˲_him.
\v 35 Not you_all /are/_saying, - ‘Still four_month ˱it˲_is and the harvest /is/_coming’? Behold, ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all, lift_up the eyes ˱of˲_you_all and see the fields, because ˱they˲_are already white toward harvest.
\v 36 The \add one\add* reaping /is/_receiving /a/_reward, and /is/_gathering_together fruit to eternal life, in_order_that the \add one\add* sowing and the \add one\add* reaping /may_be/_rejoicing together.
\v 37 For the statement in this is the true: - ‘Another \add one\add* is - sowing, and another \add one\add* - reaping.’
\v 38 I sent_ you_all _out /to_be/_reaping what you_all /have/_=> not <=_labored; others /have/_labored, and you_all /have/_come_in into the labor ˱of˲_them.”
\v 39 ¶ And many ˱of˲_the Samaritans out_of - ˱of˲_> that <_city, believed on him, because_of the word ˱of˲_the woman testifying, - “˱He˲_told ˱to˲_me all \add things\add* whatever ˱I˲_did.”
\v 40 Therefore when the Samaritans came to him, ˱they˲_/were/_asking him /to/_remain with them, and ˱he˲_remained there two days.
\v 41 And ˱with˲_many more believed, because_of the word ˱of˲_him,
\v 42 ˱to˲_the and women ˱they˲_/were/_saying, - “˱We˲_/are/_believing no_longer because_of - your speech; for ˱we˲_/have/_heard ourselves and ˱we˲_/have/_known that this is truly the Savior ˱of˲_the world.”
\v 43 ¶ And after the two days, ˱he˲_came_out from_there into - Galilee.
\v 44 For himself \nd Jesus\nd* testified that /a/_prophet in his own hometown, /is/_=> not <=_having honor.
\v 45 Therefore When ˱he˲_came into - Galilee, the Galileans received him, /having/_seen all \add things\add* as_much_as ˱he˲_did in Jerusalem at the feast, for they also came to the feast.
\v 46 ¶ Therefore ¶ ˱he˲_came again to - Cana - ˱of˲_Galilee, where ˱he˲_made the water wine. And was /a/_certain royal \add official\add*, ˱of˲_whose - son /was/_ailing in Capernaum.
\v 47 This \add one\add* /having/_heard that \nd Jesus\nd* /is/_coming out_of - Judea into - Galilee, went_away to him, and /was/_asking that ˱he˲_/may/_come_down, and /may/_heal the son ˱of˲_him, for ˱he˲_/was/_going /to_be/_dying_off.
\v 48 Therefore said - \nd Jesus\nd* to him, “If ˱you_all˲_/may/_=> not <=_see signs and wonders, ˱you_all˲_/may/_=> by_no_means not <=_believe.”
\v 49 The royal \add official\add* /is/_saying to him, “Sir, come_down before the little_child ˱of˲_me /to/_die_off.”
\v 50 - \nd Jesus\nd* /is/_saying ˱to˲_him, “/Be/_going, the son ˱of˲_you /is/_living.” The man believed ˱in˲_the word which - \nd Jesus\nd* said ˱to˲_him, and ˱he˲_/was/_going.
\v 51 And already ˱of˲_him coming_down, the slaves ˱of˲_him met ˱with˲_him and reported saying that the boy ˱of˲_him /is/_living.
\v 52 Therefore ˱he˲_inquired the hour from them in which ˱he˲_had better. Therefore ˱they˲_said ˱to˲_him, - “Yesterday the fever left him ˱at˲_/the/_=> seventh <=_hour.”
\v 53 Therefore the father knew that that \add was\add* ˱at˲_the hour at which - \nd Jesus\nd* said ˱to˲_him, “The son ˱of˲_you /is/_living”, and himself and the whole house ˱of˲_him believed.
\v 54 And this \add is\add* again /the/_second sign - \nd Jesus\nd* did, /having/_come out_of - Judea into - Galilee.
\c 5
\v 1 ¶ After these \add things\add* ˱there˲_was /a/_feast ˱of˲_the Jews, and \nd Jesus\nd* went_up to Jerusalem.
\v 2 And ˱there˲_is /a/_pool in - Jerusalem at the Sheep_Gate, - /being/_called Bethsaida In_Hebrew, having five porticos.
\v 3 In these /a/_multitude ˱of˲_the \add ones\add* ailing, blind, lame, paralyzed. /was/_lying,
\v 4
\v 5 And was /a/_certain man there, being thirty eight years in the sicknesses ˱of˲_him.
\v 6 - \nd Jesus\nd* /having/_seen this \add one\add* lying_down, and /having/_known that ˱he˲_/is/_=> already <=_having much time, ˱he˲_/is/_saying ˱to˲_him, “˱You˲_/are/_wanting healthy /to/_become?”
\v 7 The \add one\add* ailing answered ˱to˲_him, “Sir, ˱I˲_/am/_=> not <=_having /a/_person, in_order_that whenever the water /may_be/_disturbed, ˱he˲_/may/_put me into the pool; in but which /am/_coming I, another before me /is/_coming_down.”
\v 8 - \nd Jesus\nd* /is/_saying ˱to˲_him, “/Be/_raising, take_up the pallet ˱of˲_you, and /be/_walking.”
\v 9 And immediately the man became healthy, and took_up the pallet ˱of˲_him, and /was/_walking. ¶ And ˱it˲_was /the/_Sabbath on that - day.
\v 10 Therefore the Jews /were/_saying ˱to˲_the \add one\add* /having_been/_healed, “˱It˲_is /the/_Sabbath, and ˱it˲_/is/_=> not <=_permitting ˱for˲_you /to/_take_up the pallet ˱of˲_you.”
\v 11 but /the/_one answered ˱to˲_them, “The \add one\add* /having/_made me healthy, that \add one\add* said ˱to˲_me, ‘Take_up the pallet ˱of˲_you and /be/_walking.’”
\v 12 ˱They˲_asked him, “Who is the man - /having/_said ˱to˲_you, ‘Take_up and /be/_walking’?”
\v 13 But the \add one\add* /having_been/_healed not /had/_known who ˱he˲_is, - for \nd Jesus\nd* bowed_out, /a/_crowd being in the place.
\v 14 After these \add things\add* - \nd Jesus\nd* /is/_finding him in the temple, and ˱he˲_said ˱to˲_him, “Behold, ˱you˲_/have/_become healthy; /be/_=> no_longer <=_sinning, in_order_that something worse /may/_=> not <=_become ˱to˲_you.”
\v 15 The man went_away, and declared ˱to˲_the Jews that \nd Jesus\nd* is the \add one\add* /having/_made him healthy.
\v 16 And because_of this, the Jews /were/_persecuting - \nd Jesus\nd*, because ˱he˲_/was/_doing these \add things\add* on /a/_Sabbath.
\v 17 But he answered ˱to˲_them, “The Father ˱of˲_me /is/_working until now, and_I /am/_working.”
\v 18 Therefore because_of this, the Jews /were/_=> more <=_seeking him /to/_kill_off, because ˱he˲_/was/_=> not only <=_breaking the Sabbath, but also ˱he˲_/was/_calling \nd God\nd* /his/_own Father -, making himself equal - ˱to˲_\nd God\nd*.
\v 19 ¶ Therefore - \nd Jesus\nd* answered, and /was/_saying ˱to˲_them, “Truly, truly, ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all, the Son /is/_=> not <=_able /to_be/_doing nothing of himself, except - anything /may_be/_seeing the Father doing; for whatever - that \add one\add* /may_be/_doing, these \add things\add* also the Son likewise /is/_doing.
\v 20 For the Father /is/_loving the Son, and /is/_showing all \add things\add* ˱to˲_him which himself /is/_doing, and ˱he˲_/will_be/_showing greater \add than\add* these \add things\add* works ˱to˲_him, in_order_that you_all /may_be/_marveling.
\v 21 For as the Father /is/_raising the dead and /is/_giving_life, thus also the Son, /is/_giving_life whom /is/_willing.
\v 22 For and_not the Father /is/_judging no_one, but /has/_given - all judgment ˱to˲_the Son,
\v 23 in_order_that all /may_be/_honoring the Son, as ˱they˲_/are/_honoring the Father. The \add one\add* not honoring the Son, /is/_=> not <=_honoring the Father, the \add one\add* /having/_sent him.
\v 24 Truly, truly, ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all that the \add one\add* hearing the word ˱of˲_me, and believing ˱in˲_the \add one\add* /having/_sent me, /is/_having eternal life, and /is/_=> not <=_coming into judgment, but /has/_departed out_of - death into - life.
\v 25 ¶ Truly, truly, ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all that /an/_hour /is/_coming and now is, when the dead /will_be/_hearing ˱of˲_the voice ˱of˲_the Son - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*, and the \add ones\add* /having/_heard /will_be/_living.
\v 26 For as the Father /is/_having life in himself, thus also ˱he˲_gave life ˱to˲_the Son /to_be/_having in himself;
\v 27 and ˱he˲_gave authority ˱to˲_him /to_be/_executing judgment, because ˱he˲_is /the/_Son ˱of˲_Man.
\v 28 /Be/_=> not <=_marveling ˱at˲_this, because /an/_hour /is/_coming in which all the \add ones\add* in the tombs /will_be/_hearing ˱of˲_the voice ˱of˲_him,
\v 29 and the \add ones\add* /having/_practiced the good \add things\add* ˱they˲_/will_be/_going_out, to /the/_resurrection ˱of˲_life, and the \add ones\add* the /having/_done evil \add things\add*, to /the/_resurrection ˱of˲_judgment.
\v 30 ¶ I /am/_=> not <=_being_able /to_be/_doing nothing of myself; as ˱I˲_/am/_hearing, ˱I˲_/am/_judging, and - my - judgment is righteous, because ˱I˲_/am/_=> not <=_seeking - my - will, but the will ˱of˲_the \add one\add* /having/_sent me.
\v 31 ¶ If I /may_be/_testifying concerning myself, the testimony ˱of˲_me is not true.
\v 32 Another is the \add one\add* testifying concerning me, and ˱I˲_/have/_known that the testimony which ˱he˲_/is/_testifying concerning me is true.
\v 33 You_all /have/_sent_out to John, and ˱he˲_/has/_testified ˱to˲_the truth.
\v 34 But I /am/_=> not <=_receiving the testimony from human_origin, but these \add things\add* ˱I˲_/am/_saying, in_order_that you_all /may_be/_saved.
\v 35 That \add one\add* was the lamp - /being/_burned and shining, and you_all willed /to_be/_exulted for /a/_hour in the light ˱of˲_him.
\v 36 But I /am/_having the testimony greater \add than\add* - John, for the works that the Father /has/_given ˱to˲_me, in_order_that ˱I˲_/may/_complete them, the same works which ˱I˲_/am/_doing, /is/_testifying concerning me that the Father /has/_sent_ me _out.
\v 37 And the Father /having/_sent me, that \add one\add* /has/_testified concerning me. ˱You_all˲_/have/_=> neither <=_heard /the/_voice ˱of˲_him ever, nor /have/_˱you_all˲_seen appearance ˱of˲_him.
\v 38 And ˱you_all˲_/are/_=> not <=_having the word ˱of˲_him remaining in you_all, because you_all /are/_=> not <=_believing ˱in˲_this \add one\add* that \add one\add* whom ˱he˲_sent_out.
\v 39 ¶ ˱You_all˲_/are/_searching the Scriptures, because you_all /are/_supposing /to_be/_having eternal life in them, and those are the \add ones\add* testifying concerning me;
\v 40 and ˱you_all˲_/are/_=> not <=_willing /to/_come to me, in_order_that ˱you_all˲_/may_be/_having life.
\v 41 ˱I˲_/am/_=> not <=_receiving glory from humans,
\v 42 but ˱I˲_/have/_known that you_all ˱you_all˲_/are/_=> not <=_having the love - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd* in yourselves.
\v 43 I /have/_come in the name ˱of˲_the Father ˱of˲_me, and ˱you_all˲_/are/_=> not <=_receiving me; if another /may/_come in - his own name, ˱you_all˲_/will_be/_receiving that \add one\add*.
\v 44 How /are/_=> you_all <=_being_able /to/_believe, receiving glory from one_another, and ˱you_all˲_/are/_=> not <=_seeking the glory which \add is\add* from the only?
\v 45 Not /be/_supposing that I /will_be/_accusing ˱against˲_you_all before the Father. the \add one\add* accusing ˱against˲_you_all Is Moses, in whom you_all /have/_hoped.
\v 46 For if ˱you_all˲_/were/_believing ˱in˲_Moses, ˱you_all˲_/were/_believing - ˱in˲_me, for that \add one\add* wrote concerning me.
\v 47 But if ˱you_all˲_/are/_=> not <=_believing ˱in˲_the writings ˱of˲_that \add one\add*, how /will_˱you_all˲_/be_believing - ˱in˲_my words?”
\c 6
\v 1 ¶ After these \add things\add*, - \nd Jesus\nd* went_away across the sea - ˱of˲_Galilee - ˱of˲_Tiberias.
\v 2 And /a/_=> great <=_crowd /was/_following ˱after˲_him, because ˱they˲_/were/_observing the signs which ˱he˲_/was/_doing with the \add ones\add* ailing.
\v 3 And \nd Jesus\nd* went_up into the mountain, and ˱he˲_/was/_sitting there with the disciples ˱of˲_him.
\v 4 And the Passover was near, the feast ˱of˲_the Jews.
\v 5 Therefore - \nd Jesus\nd* /having/_lifted_up his eyes, and /having/_seen that /a/_great crowd /is/_coming to him, ˱he˲_/is/_saying to Philip, “From_where /may/_˱we˲_buy loaves, in_order_that /may/_eat these?”
\v 6 for ˱he˲_/was/_saying this testing him, And he /had/_known what ˱he˲_/was/_going /to_be/_doing.
\v 7 Philip answered ˱to˲_him, “˱For˲_two_hundred denarii /are/_=> not <=_sufficing loaves ˱for˲_them, that each /may/_receive little \add thing\add*.”
\v 8 one of the disciples ˱of˲_him, Andrew the brother ˱of˲_Simon Peter /Is/_saying ˱to˲_him,
\v 9 “Here is /a/_little_boy, who /is/_having five loaves ˱of˲_barley and two fish, but what is these for so_many?”
\v 10 - \nd Jesus\nd* Said, “Make the people /to/_sit_down.” And ˱there˲_was grass much in the place. Therefore the men sat_down, the number about five_thousand.
\v 11 therefore - \nd Jesus\nd* Took the loaves, and /having/_given_thanks, ˱he˲_distributed ˱to˲_the \add ones\add* reclining, likewise also of the fish, as_much_as ˱they˲_/were/_wanting.
\v 12 And when ˱they˲_/were/_filled, ˱he˲_/is/_saying ˱to˲_the disciples ˱of˲_him, “Gather_together the fragments being_leftover, in_order_that not anything /may/_lose.”
\v 13 Therefore ˱they˲_gathered_together and ˱they˲_filled twelve baskets ˱of˲_fragments from the five - barley loaves, which ˱they˲_were_leftover ˱to˲_the \add ones\add* /having/_eaten.
\v 14 Therefore the people /having/_seen what signs ˱he˲_did /were/_saying, - “This is truly the prophet who coming into the world.”
\v 15 ¶ Therefore \nd Jesus\nd* /having/_known that ˱they˲_/are/_going /to_be/_coming and /to_be/_snatching him, in_order_that ˱they˲_/may/_make \add him\add* king, ˱he˲_> himself only <_withdrew again to the mountain.
\v 16 ¶ And when ˱it˲_became evening, the disciples ˱of˲_him came_down to the sea,
\v 17 and /having/_boarded into /the/_boat, ˱they˲_/were/_coming across the sea to Capernaum. And darkness already /had/_become, and - \nd Jesus\nd* /had/_=> not_yet <=_come to them.
\v 18 And the sea /was_being/_awoke ˱by˲_/a/_=> great <=_wind blowing.
\v 19 Therefore /having/_rowed about twenty five or thirty stadiums, ˱they˲_/are/_observing - \nd Jesus\nd* walking on the sea, and becoming near the boat, and ˱they˲_/were/_afraid.
\v 20 But he /is/_saying ˱to˲_them, “I am \add he\add*, /be/_=> not <=_fearing.”
\v 21 Therefore ˱they˲_/were/_willing /to/_receive him into the boat, and immediately the boat became at the land to which ˱they˲_/were/_going.
\v 22 ¶ ˱On˲_the_> of_next <_\add day\add* the crowd - /having/_stood across ˱of˲_the sea, saw that no other little_boat was there except - one, and that - \nd Jesus\nd* not entered_with ˱with˲_the disciples ˱of˲_him into the boat, but only the disciples ˱of˲_him went_away;
\v 23 other boats came from Tiberias, near the place where ˱they˲_ate the bread, /having/_=> \nd Lord\nd* the <=_given_thanks.
\v 24 Therefore when the crowd saw that \nd Jesus\nd* is not there, nor the disciples ˱of˲_him, they boarded into the little_boats, and ˱they˲_came to Capernaum seeking - \nd Jesus\nd*.
\v 25 ¶ And /having/_found him across ˱of˲_the sea, ˱they˲_said ˱to˲_him, “Rabbi, when /have/_˱you˲_become here?”
\v 26 - \nd Jesus\nd* answered ˱to˲_them and said, “Truly, truly, ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all, ˱you_all˲_/are/_seeking me, not because ˱you_all˲_saw signs, but because ˱you_all˲_ate of the loaves and /were/_satisfied.
\v 27 /Be/_=> not <=_working ˱for˲_the - perishing food, but the food - remaining to eternal life, which the Son - ˱of˲_Man /will_be/_giving ˱to˲_you_all, for - \nd God\nd* the Father sealed this \add one\add*.”
\v 28 Therefore ˱they˲_said to him, “What /may_˱we˲_/be_doing, in_order_that ˱we˲_/may_be/_doing the works - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*?”
\v 29 - \nd Jesus\nd* Answered and said ˱to˲_them, “This is the work - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*, that ˱you_all˲_/may_be/_believing in whom that \add one\add* sent_out.”
\v 30 Therefore ˱they˲_said ˱to˲_him, “Therefore what sign /are/_doing you, in_order_that ˱we˲_/may/_see and ˱we˲_/may/_believe ˱in˲_you? What /are/_˱you˲_doing?
\v 31 The fathers ˱of˲_us ate the manna in the desert, as is /having_been/_written, ‘˱he˲_gave bread out_of - heaven ˱to˲_them /to/_eat.’”
\v 32 Therefore - \nd Jesus\nd* said ˱to˲_them, “Truly, truly, ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all, Moses /has/_=> not <=_given ˱to˲_you_all the bread out_of - heaven, but the Father ˱of˲_me /is/_giving ˱to˲_you_all the - true bread out_of - heaven.
\v 33 For the bread - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd* is the \add one\add* coming_down out_of - heaven, and giving life ˱to˲_the world.”
\v 34 Therefore ˱they˲_said to him, “Sir, always give this - bread ˱to˲_us.”
\v 35 - \nd Jesus\nd* said ˱to˲_them, “I am the bread - ˱of˲_life; the \add one\add* coming to me, by_no_means /may/_=> not <=_hunger, and the \add one\add* believing in me, by_no_means /will_ not ever _be/_thirsting.
\v 36 But ˱I˲_said ˱to˲_you_all that ˱you_all˲_> both <_/have/_seen me and ˱you_all˲_/are/_=> not <=_believing.
\v 37 Everyone that the Father /is/_giving ˱to˲_me, /will_be/_coming to me, and the \add one\add* coming to me, by_no_means ˱I˲_/may/_=> not <=_cast_out out.
\v 38 Because ˱I˲_/have/_came_down from - heaven, not in_order_that ˱I˲_/may_be/_doing - my - will, but the will ˱of˲_the \add one\add* /having/_sent me.
\v 39 And this is the will ˱of˲_the \add one\add* /having/_sent me, that everything which ˱he˲_/has/_given ˱to˲_me, ˱I˲_/may/_=> not <=_lose of it, but ˱I˲_/will_be/_raising_ it _up ˱on˲_the last day.
\v 40 For this is the will ˱of˲_the Father ˱of˲_me, that everyone - observing the Son and believing in him, /may_be/_having eternal life, and I /will_be/_raising_ him _up ˱on˲_the last day.”
\v 41 therefore the Jews ¶ /Were/_grumbling about him, because ˱he˲_said, “I am the bread the \add one\add* /having/_come_down out_of - heaven.”
\v 42 And ˱they˲_/were/_saying, is this “Not \nd Jesus\nd* the son ˱of˲_Joseph, ˱of˲_whose - father and - mother we /have/_known? How now /is/_˱he˲_saying, - ‘˱I˲_/have/_came_down out_of - heaven’?”
\v 43 \nd Jesus\nd* Answered and said ˱to˲_them, “/Be/_=> not <=_grumbling with one_another.
\v 44 No_one /is/_able /to/_come to me, if not the Father, the \add one\add* /having/_sent me, /may/_draw him, and_I /will_be/_raising_ him _up the last day.
\v 45 ˱It˲_is /having_been/_written in the prophets, ‘and ˱they˲_will_ all _be taught ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*.’ Everyone - /having/_heard from the Father and /having/_learned, /is/_coming to me.
\v 46 Not that anyone /has/_seen the Father, except - the \add one\add* being from - \nd God\nd*, this \add one\add* /has/_seen the Father.
\v 47 Truly, truly, ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all, the \add one\add* believing /is/_having eternal life.
\v 48 I am the bread - ˱of˲_life.
\v 49 The fathers ˱of˲_you_all ate the manna in the desert, and ˱they˲_died_off.
\v 50 This is the bread - coming_down out_of - heaven, in_order_that anyone /may/_eat of it, and /may/_=> not <=_die_off.
\v 51 I am the - living bread - /having/_come_down out_of - heaven; if anyone /may/_eat of this - bread, ˱he˲_/will_be/_living to the age. The even and bread that I /will_be/_giving, is the flesh ˱of˲_me.” for the life ˱of˲_the world.”
\v 52 ¶ Therefore the Jews /were/_quarrelling with one_another saying, “How /is/_=> this \add one\add* <=_able /to/_give ˱to˲_us the flesh ˱of˲_him /to/_eat?”
\v 53 Therefore - \nd Jesus\nd* said ˱to˲_them, “Truly, truly, ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all, if not ˱you_all˲_/may/_eat the flesh ˱of˲_the Son - ˱of˲_Man, and ˱you_all˲_/may/_drink ˱of˲_him the blood, ˱you_all˲_/are/_=> not <=_having life in yourselves.
\v 54 The \add one\add* eating the flesh ˱of˲_me, and drinking the blood ˱of˲_me, /is/_having eternal life, and_I /will_be/_raising_up him ˱at˲_the last day.
\v 55 For the flesh ˱of˲_me is true food, and the blood ˱of˲_me is true drink.
\v 56 The \add one\add* eating the flesh ˱of˲_me, and drinking the blood ˱of˲_me, /is/_remaining in me, and_I in him.
\v 57 As the living Father sent_ me _out, and_I /am/_living because_of the Father, also the \add one\add* eating me, and_that \add one\add* /will_be/_living because_of me.
\v 58 This is the bread - /having/_come_down from heaven, not as the fathers ate and ˱they˲_died_off; the \add one\add* eating this - bread /will_be/_living to the age.”
\v 59 ˱He˲_said these \add things\add* in /the/_synagogue, teaching in Capernaum.
\v 60 ¶ Therefore many of the disciples /having/_heard ˱of˲_him said, this - word is hard; who /is/_able /to_be/_hearing ˱of˲_it?”
\v 61 But - \nd Jesus\nd* /having/_known in himself that the disciples ˱of˲_him /are/_grumbling about this, ˱he˲_said ˱to˲_them, “This /is/_offending you_all?
\v 62 Therefore if ˱you_all˲_/may_be/_observing the Son - ˱of˲_Man, going_up where ˱he˲_was - earlier?
\v 63 The \nd Spirit\nd* is - giving_life, the flesh /is/_=> not <=_benefiting nothing. The words which I /have/_spoken ˱to˲_you_all is spirit and is life.
\v 64 But ˱there˲_are some of you_all who /are/_=> not <=_believing.” For - \nd Jesus\nd* /had/_known from /the/_beginning, who_all are the \add ones\add* not believing, and who is the \add one\add* /going_to/_give_ him _over.
\v 65 And ˱he˲_/was/_saying, “Because_of this ˱I˲_/have/_said ˱to˲_you_all that no_one /is/_able /to/_come to me, if may_be /having_ not _been/_given ˱to˲_him from the Father.”
\v 66 ¶ From this many out_of ˱of˲_the disciples ˱of˲_him went_away to the \add things\add* back, and no_longer /were/_walking with him.
\v 67 Therefore - \nd Jesus\nd* said ˱to˲_the twelve, “You_all also /are/_=> not <=_wanting /to_be/_going_away?”
\v 68 Simon Peter answered ˱to˲_him, “\nd Lord\nd*, to whom /will_˱we˲_/be_going_away? ˱You˲_/are/_having /the/_words eternal ˱of˲_life.
\v 69 And we /have/_believed and ˱we˲_/have/_known that you are the Holy \add One\add* - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*.”
\v 70 - \nd Jesus\nd* answered ˱to˲_them, “Not I chose you_all the twelve, and one of you_all is /a/_devil?”
\v 71 And ˱he˲_/was/_speaking - ˱to˲_Judas ˱of˲_Simon ˱of˲_Iscariot; for this \add one\add* one of the twelve /was/_going /to_be/_giving_ him _over.
\c 7
\v 1 ¶ And after these \add things\add*, - \nd Jesus\nd* /was/_walking in - Galilee, for ˱he˲_/was/_=> not <=_wanting /to_be/_walking in - Judea, because the Jews /were/_seeking /to/_kill_ him _off.
\v 2 And ˱it˲_was near the feast ˱of˲_the Jews the Tabernacles.
\v 3 Therefore the brothers ˱of˲_him said to him, “Depart from_here, and /be/_going into - Judea, in_order_that also the disciples ˱of˲_you /will_be/_observing ˱of˲_you the works that ˱you˲_/are/_doing.
\v 4 For no_one /is/_doing anything in secret and /is/_seeking himself to_be in public.” If ˱you˲_/are/_doing these \add things\add*, reveal yourself ˱to˲_the world.
\v 5 For not_even the brothers ˱of˲_him /were/_believing in him.
\v 6 Therefore - \nd Jesus\nd* /is/_saying ˱to˲_them, “- my - time /is/_=> not_yet <=_coming, but - your - time always is ready.
\v 7 The world /is/_=> not <=_able /to_be/_hating you_all, but ˱it˲_/is/_hating me, because I /am/_testifying concerning it that the works ˱of˲_it is evil.
\v 8 You_all go_up to the feast; I not_yet /am/_going_up to this - feast, because - my time /has_ not_yet _been/_fulfilled.”
\v 9 And /having/_said these \add things\add* ˱to˲_them ˱he˲_remained in - Galilee.
\v 10 ¶ But when the brothers ˱of˲_him went_up to the feast, then he also went_up, not openly, but as in secret.
\v 11 Therefore the Jews /were/_seeking him at the feast, and ˱they˲_/were/_saying, “Where is that \add one\add*?”
\v 12 And ˱there˲_was much grumbling concerning him among the crowds. The \add ones\add* on_one_hand /were/_saying, - “˱He˲_is good”, on_the_other_hand others /were/_saying, “No, but ˱he˲_/is/_deceiving the crowd.”
\v 13 No_one however /was/_speaking ˱in˲_public concerning him, because_of the fear ˱of˲_the Jews.
\v 14 ¶ But now being_middle ˱of˲_the feast, \nd Jesus\nd* went_up into the temple and /was/_teaching.
\v 15 Therefore the Jews /were/_marveling saying, “How /has/_=> this \add one\add* <=_known letters, not /having/_learned?”
\v 16 Therefore \nd Jesus\nd* answered ˱to˲_them and said, “- my teaching not is mine, but ˱of˲_the \add one\add* /having/_sent me.
\v 17 If anyone /may_be/_wanting /to_be/_practicing the will ˱of˲_him, ˱he˲_/will_be/_knowing concerning the teaching, whether ˱it˲_is from - \nd God\nd*, or I /am/_speaking from myself.
\v 18 The \add one\add* speaking from himself, /is/_seeking the his own glory; but the \add one\add* seeking the glory ˱of˲_the \add one\add* /having/_sent him, this \add one\add* is true, and unrighteousness is not in him.
\v 19 /has/_=> ¶ not Moses <=_given ˱to˲_you_all the law, and no_one of you_all /is/_practicing the law? Why ˱you_all˲_/are/_seeking /to/_kill_ me _off?”
\v 20 The crowd answered, “˱You˲_/are/_having /a/_demon; who /is/_seeking /to/_kill_ you _off?”
\v 21 \nd Jesus\nd* answered and said ˱to˲_them, “˱I˲_did one work and ˱you_all˲_> all <_/are/_marveling.
\v 22 Because_of this Moses /has/_given ˱to˲_you_all - circumcision (not that is of - Moses, but of the fathers), and on /the/_Sabbath ˱you_all˲_/are/_circumcising /a/_man.
\v 23 If /a/_man /is/_receiving circumcision on /the/_Sabbath, in_order_that the law ˱of˲_Moses /may_ not _be/_broken, ˱you_all˲_/are/_angry ˱with˲_me because ˱I˲_made /a/_man whole healthy on /the/_Sabbath?
\v 24 /Be/_=> not <=_judging according_to appearance, but /be/_judging - righteous judgment.”
\v 25 ¶ Therefore some of ˱of˲_the Jerusalemites /were/_saying, “Is not this whom ˱they˲_/are/_seeking /to/_kill_off?
\v 26 And behold, ˱he˲_/is/_speaking ˱in˲_public, and /are/_saying nothing ˱to˲_him. Perhaps the rulers knew that this truly is the \nd Messiah\nd*?
\v 27 But ˱we˲_/have/_known this \add one\add* from_where ˱he˲_is. But the \nd Messiah\nd* whenever ˱he˲_/may_be/_coming, no_one /is/_knowing from_where ˱he˲_is.”
\v 28 Therefore \nd Jesus\nd* cried_out in the temple teaching, and saying, “˱You_all˲_/have/_known also_me, and ˱you_all˲_/have/_known from_where ˱I˲_am; and ˱I˲_/have/_=> not <=_come of myself, but the \add one\add* /having/_sent me is true, whom you_all /have/_=> not <=_known.
\v 29 I /have/_known him, because ˱I˲_am from him, and_that \add one\add* sent_ me _out.”
\v 30 Therefore ˱they˲_/were/_seeking /to/_arrest him, but no_one laid_on his hand on him, because the hour ˱of˲_him /had/_=> not_yet <=_come.
\v 31 The but many of crowd believed in him, and ˱they˲_/were/_saying, “Whenever the \nd Messiah\nd*, /may/_come, /will_ not _be/_doing more signs \add than\add* which this \add man\add* did?”
\v 32 the Pharisees heard ˱of˲_the crowd grumbling concerning him these \add things\add*, and sent_out the chief_priests and the Pharisees attendants, in_order_that ˱they˲_/may/_arrest him.
\v 33 Therefore - \nd Jesus\nd* said, “˱I˲_am still /a/_little time with you_all, and ˱I˲_/am/_going to the \add one\add* /having/_sent me.
\v 34 ˱You_all˲_/will_be/_seeking me, and ˱you_all˲_/will_ not _be/_finding, me and where am I you_all, /are/_=> not <=_being_able /to/_come.”
\v 35 Therefore the Jews said to themselves, “Where /is/_=> this \add one\add* <=_going /to_be/_going, that we /will_ not _be/_finding him? ˱He˲_/is/_=> not <=_going /to_be/_going to the dispersion ˱of˲_the Greeks, and /to_be/_teaching the Greeks?
\v 36 What is - this word that ˱he˲_said, ‘˱You_all˲_/will_be/_seeking me, and ˱you_all˲_/will_ not _be/_finding, me and where am I, you_all /are/_=> not <=_being_able /to/_come’?”
\v 37 ¶ And at the - great last day ˱of˲_the feast - \nd Jesus\nd* /had/_stood, and cried_out saying, “If anyone /may_be/_thirsting, /let_˱him˲_/be_coming to me and /let_˱him˲_/be_drinking.
\v 38 The \add one\add* believing in me, as the Scripture said, ‘Rivers ˱of˲_> living <_water /will_be/_flowing out_of the belly ˱of˲_him.’”
\v 39 But ˱he˲_said this concerning the \nd Spirit\nd*, ˱of˲_whom ˱they˲_/were/_going /to_be/_receiving, the \add ones\add* /having/_believed on him; for /the/_\nd Spirit\nd* was not_yet, because \nd Jesus\nd* /was/_glorified not_yet.
\v 40 Therefore the ¶ Of crowd, /having/_heard - ˱of˲_> these <_words, ˱they˲_/were/_saying, “This is truly the prophet”.
\v 41 Others /were/_saying, “This is the \nd Messiah\nd*.” But they /were/_saying, “For the \nd Messiah\nd* /is/_=> not <=_coming out_of - Galilee?
\v 42 Not the Scripture said that the \nd Messiah\nd* /is/_coming out_of the seed ˱of˲_David, and from Bethlehem, the village where David was?”
\v 43 Therefore /a/_division became in the crowd because_of him.
\v 44 And some of them /were/_wanting /to/_arrest him, but no_one laid their hands on him.
\v 45 ¶ Therefore ¶ the attendants came to the chief_priests and Pharisees, and those said ˱to˲_them, “For_reason why ˱you_all˲_> not <_brought him?”
\v 46 the attendants answered, “/A/_person never spoke thus.”
\v 47 Therefore the Pharisees answered ˱to˲_them, “Not you_all /have_been/_deceived also?
\v 48 Not anyone of the rulers believed in him, or of the Pharisees?
\v 49 But - this crowd, - not knowing the law, are accursed.”
\v 50 Nicodemus the \add one\add* /having/_come to him earlier, being one of them /Is/_saying, to them,
\v 51 “Not the law ˱of˲_us /is/_judging the person, if not first /may/_hear from him, and /may/_know what ˱he˲_/is/_doing?”
\v 52 ˱They˲_answered and said ˱to˲_him, “Are not you from - Galilee also? Search and see that /a/_prophet /is_ not _being/_raised out_of - Galilee.”

\v 12 ¶ Therefore - \nd Jesus\nd* spoke ˱to˲_them again saying, “I am the light ˱of˲_the world; the \add one\add* following me by_no_means /may/_=> not <=_walk in the darkness, but /will_be/_having the light - ˱of˲_life.”
\v 13 Therefore the Pharisees said ˱to˲_him, “You /are/_testifying about yourself; the testimony ˱of˲_you is not true.”
\v 14 \nd Jesus\nd* answered, and said ˱to˲_them, “Even_if I /may_be/_testifying about myself, the testimony ˱of˲_me, is true, because ˱I˲_/have/_known from_where ˱I˲_came and where ˱I˲_/am/_going. But you_all /have/_=> not <=_known from_where ˱I˲_/am/_coming or where ˱I˲_/am/_going.
\v 15 You_all /are/_judging according_to the flesh, I /am/_=> not <=_judging no_one.
\v 16 but Even if I ˱I˲_/may_be/_judging, - my - judgment is true, because ˱I˲_am not /the/_only \add one\add*, but I and the Father /having/_sent me.
\v 17 The also /has_been/_written in and - your law, that the testimony ˱of˲_two men is true.
\v 18 I am the \add one\add* testifying about myself, and the Father /having/_sent me /is/_testifying about me.”
\v 19 Therefore ˱they˲_/were/_saying ˱to˲_him, “Where is the father ˱of˲_you?” \nd Jesus\nd* answered, “˱You_all˲_/have/_known neither me, nor the Father ˱of˲_me. If ˱you_all˲_/had/_known me, ˱you_all˲_> would <_/had/_known also the Father ˱of˲_me.”
\v 20 ˱He˲_spoke these - words in the treasury, teaching in the temple; and no_one arrested him, because the hour ˱of˲_him /had/_=> not_yet <=_come.
\v 21 ¶ Therefore ¶ ˱he˲_said again ˱to˲_them, “I /am/_going_away and ˱you_all˲_/will_be/_seeking me, and ˱you_all˲_/will_be/_dying_off in the sin ˱of˲_you_all; you_all /are/_=> not <=_being_able /to/_come where I /am/_going.”
\v 22 Therefore /were/_saying the Jews, “Surely_not ˱he˲_/will_be/_killing_off himself, that ˱he˲_/is/_saying, ‘Where I /am/_going you_all, not /are/_being_able /to/_come’?”
\v 23 And ˱he˲_/was/_saying ˱to˲_them, “You_all are from the \add things\add* below, I am from the \add things\add* above; you_all are of this - world, I am not of - this world.
\v 24 Therefore ˱I˲_said ˱to˲_you_all that ˱you_all˲_/will_be/_dying_off in the sins ˱of˲_you_all; for if ˱you_all˲_/may/_=> not <=_believe that I am \add he\add*, ˱you_all˲_/will_be/_dying_off in the sins ˱of˲_you_all.”
\v 25 Therefore ˱they˲_/were/_saying ˱to˲_him, “Who are you?” \nd Jesus\nd* said ˱to˲_them, “˱From˲_the beginning what something ˱I˲_/am/_speaking also ˱to˲_you_all?
\v 26 ˱I˲_/am/_having /to_be/_speaking And /to_be/_judging many \add things\add* concerning you_all; but the \add one\add* /having/_sent me is true, and_ what _I heard from him, ˱I˲_/am/_speaking these \add things\add* to the world.”
\v 27 ˱They˲_> not <_knew that ˱he˲_/was/_speaking ˱to˲_them ˱about˲_the Father.
\v 28 Therefore - \nd Jesus\nd* said ˱to˲_them, - “Whenever ˱you_all˲_/may/_exalt the Son - ˱of˲_Man, then ˱you_all˲_/will_be/_knowing that I am \add he\add*, and ˱I˲_/am/_doing nothing from myself, but as the Father taught me, ˱I˲_/am/_speaking these \add things\add*.
\v 29 And the \add one\add* /having/_sent me, is with me;, ˱he˲_> not <_left me alone, because I /am/_=> always <=_doing the \add things\add* pleasing ˱to˲_him.”
\v 30 Speaking ˱of˲_him these \add things\add*, many believed on him.
\v 31 ¶ Therefore - \nd Jesus\nd* /was/_saying to the Jews /having/_believed ˱in˲_him, “If you_all /may/_remain in - my - word, ˱you_all˲_are truly disciples ˱of˲_me.
\v 32 And ˱you_all˲_/will_be/_knowing the truth, and the truth /will_be/_freeing you_all.”
\v 33 ˱They˲_answered to him, “˱We˲_are seed ˱of˲_Abraham, and ˱we˲_/have/_served ˱to˲_no_one ever; how /are/_=> you <=_saying, - ‘˱You_all˲_/will_be/_becoming free’?”
\v 34 \nd Jesus\nd* answered ˱to˲_them, “Truly, truly, ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all that everyone - practicing - sin, is /a/_slave - ˱of˲_sin.
\v 35 And the slave /is/_=> not <=_remaining in the house to the age, the Son /is/_remaining to the age.
\v 36 Therefore if the Son /may/_free you_all, ˱you_all˲_will_be really free.
\v 37 ˱I˲_/have/_known that ˱you_all˲_are seed ˱of˲_Abraham, but ˱you_all˲_/are/_seeking /to/_kill_ me _off, because - my - word /is/_=> not <=_having_room in you_all.
\v 38 ˱I˲_/am/_speaking what I /have/_seen with the Father; therefore also you_all ˱you_all˲_/are/_doing what ˱you_all˲_heard with your father.”
\v 39 ¶ ˱They˲_answered and said ˱to˲_him, “The father ˱of˲_us is Abraham.” - \nd Jesus\nd* /is/_saying ˱to˲_them, “If ˱you_all˲_are children - ˱of˲_Abraham, ˱you_all˲_/were/_doing the works - ˱of˲_Abraham.
\v 40 But now ˱you_all˲_/are/_seeking /to/_kill_ me _off, /a/_man who ˱I˲_/have/_spoken the truth ˱to˲_you_all, that ˱I˲_heard from - \nd God\nd*; this Abraham did not.
\v 41 You_all /are/_doing the works ˱of˲_the father ˱of˲_you_all.” therefore ˱they˲_said ˱to˲_him, “We /have_ not _been/_born of sexual_immorality; ˱we˲_/are/_having one Father, - \nd God\nd*.”
\v 42 - \nd Jesus\nd* said ˱to˲_them, “If - \nd God\nd* was /the/_Father ˱of˲_you_all, ˱you_all˲_> would <_/were/_loving me, for I came_out from - \nd God\nd* and /am/_coming; for and_not ˱I˲_/have/_come of myself, but that \add one\add* sent_ me _out.
\v 43 for_ Why _reason ˱you_all˲_/are/_=> not <=_knowing - my - speech? Because ˱you_all˲_/are/_=> not <=_being_able /to_be/_hearing - my - word.
\v 44 You_all are of the father the devil, and ˱you_all˲_/are/_wanting /to_be/_doing the desires ˱of˲_the father ˱of˲_you_all. That \add one\add* was /a/_murderer from /the/_beginning, and /was/_=> not <=_standing in the truth, because truth is not in him.

\v 45 But I because ˱I˲_/am/_speaking the truth, ˱you_all˲_/are/_=> not <=_believing ˱in˲_me!
\v 46 Which of you_all /is/_rebuking me concerning sin? If ˱I˲_/am/_speaking /the/_truth, for_ why _reason you_all /are/_=> not <=_believing ˱in˲_me?
\v 47 The \add one\add* being of - \nd God\nd*, /is/_hearing the words - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*; because_of this you_all /are/_=> not <=_hearing, because ˱you_all˲_are not of - \nd God\nd*.”
\v 48 ¶ The Jews answered and said ˱to˲_him, /are/_=> “we not rightly <=_saying that you are /a/_Samaritan, and ˱you˲_/are/_having /a/_demon?”
\v 49 \nd Jesus\nd* answered, “I /am/_=> not <=_having /a/_demon, but ˱I˲_/am/_honoring the Father ˱of˲_me, and you_all /are/_dishonoring me.
\v 50 But I /am/_=> not <=_seeking the glory ˱of˲_me; ˱he˲_is the \add one\add* seeking and judging.
\v 51 Truly, truly, ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all, if anyone /may/_keep - my word, by_no_means ˱he˲_/may/_=> not <=_observe death to the age.”
\v 52 The Jews said ˱to˲_him, “Now ˱we˲_/have/_known that ˱you˲_/are/_having /a/_demon. Abraham died_off and the prophets, and you /are/_saying, ‘If anyone /may/_keep the word ˱of˲_me, by_no_means ˱he˲_/may/_=> not <=_taste ˱of˲_death to the age.’
\v 53 You are not greater \add than\add* Abraham the father ˱of˲_us, who died_off? Also the prophets died_off! Whom ˱you˲_/are/_making yourself?”
\v 54 \nd Jesus\nd* answered, “If I /may/_glorify myself, the glory ˱of˲_me is nothing; the Father ˱of˲_me is the \add one\add* glorifying me, ˱of˲_whom you_all /are/_saying, - ‘˱He˲_is \nd God\nd* ˱of˲_us’,
\v 55 and ˱you_all˲_/have/_=> not <=_known him, but I /have/_known him, and_if ˱I˲_/may/_say that ˱I˲_/have/_=> not <=_known him, ˱I˲_will_be /a/_liar similar ˱to˲_you_all. But ˱I˲_/have/_known him, and ˱I˲_/am/_keeping the word ˱of˲_him.
\v 56 Abraham the father ˱of˲_you_all exulted, that ˱he˲_/may/_see - my - day, and ˱he˲_saw \add it\add* and /was/_elated.”
\v 57 Therefore the Jews said to him, ˱you˲_/are/_=> not_yet <=_having fifty years, and ˱you˲_/have/_seen?” Abraham
\v 58 \nd Jesus\nd* said ˱to˲_them, “Truly, truly, ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all, before Abraham /to/_become, I am.”
\v 59 Therefore ˱they˲_took_up stones, in_order_that ˱they˲_/may/_cast at him; But \nd Jesus\nd* /was/_hidden, and came_out out_of the temple.
\c 9
\v 1 ¶ And passing_by, ˱he˲_saw /a/_man blind from birth.
\v 2 And the disciples ˱of˲_him asked him saying, “Rabbi, who sinned, this \add man\add* or the parents ˱of˲_him, in_order_that ˱he˲_/may_be/_born blind?”
\v 3 \nd Jesus\nd* answered, “Neither this \add man\add* sinned, nor the parents ˱of˲_him, but in_order_that the works - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd* /may_be/_revealed in him.
\v 4 ˱it˲_/is/_fitting Us /to_be/_working the works ˱of˲_the \add one\add* /having/_sent us, until ˱it˲_is day; night /is/_coming, when no_one /is/_able /to_be/_working.
\v 5 Whenever ˱I˲_may_be in the world, ˱I˲_am /the/_light ˱of˲_the world.”
\v 6 /Having/_said these \add things\add*, ˱he˲_spat on_the_ground and made clay of the spittle, and ˱he˲_spread_on the clay ˱of˲_him to his eyes.
\v 7 And ˱he˲_said ˱to˲_him, “/Be/_going, wash in the pool - ˱of˲_Siloam” (which /is_being/_translated, “/having_been/_sent_out”). Therefore ˱he˲_went_away and washed, and came seeing.
\v 8 Therefore the neighbors and the \add ones\add* observing him - earlier, that ˱he˲_was /a/_beggar, /were/_saying, “Is this not the \add one\add* sitting and begging?”
\v 9 Others /were/_saying, - “This ˱he˲_is”, others /were/_saying, “No, but ˱he˲_is similar ˱to˲_him.” That \add one\add* /was/_saying, - “I am \add he\add*.”
\v 10 Therefore ˱they˲_/were/_saying ˱to˲_him, “How /were/_=> the eyes ˱of˲_you <=_opened_up?”
\v 11 That \add one\add* answered, man - /being/_called \nd Jesus\nd* made clay, and spread_on the eyes ˱of˲_me, and said ˱to˲_me, - ‘/Be/_going to - Siloam and wash.’ /Having/_gone_away therefore and /having/_washed, ˱I˲_received_sight.”
\v 12 And ˱they˲_said ˱to˲_him, “Where is that \add one\add*?” ˱He˲_/is/_saying, “˱I˲_/have/_=> not <=_known.”
\v 13 ¶ ˱They˲_/are/_bringing him to the Pharisees, the once blind \add man\add*.
\v 14 And ˱it˲_was /the/_Sabbath in which day - \nd Jesus\nd* made the clay, and opened_up the eyes ˱of˲_him.
\v 15 Therefore again the Pharisees ˱they˲_/were/_asking him also how ˱he˲_received_sight. And he said ˱to˲_them, “˱He˲_put_on clay on the eyes ˱of˲_me, and ˱I˲_washed, and ˱I˲_/am/_seeing.”
\v 16 Therefore some of the Pharisees /were/_saying, this \add one\add* - man is “not from \nd God\nd*, because ˱he˲_/is/_=> not <=_keeping the Sabbath.” Others /were/_saying, “How /is/_=> sinful /a/_man <=_able /to_be/_doing such signs?” And was /a/_division among them.
\v 17 Therefore ˱they˲_/are/_saying again ˱to˲_the blind \add man\add*, “What /are/_=> you <=_saying about him, because ˱he˲_opened_up the eyes ˱of˲_you?” And he said, - “˱He˲_is /a/_prophet.”
\v 18 ¶ Therefore the Jews not believed him concerning that ˱he˲_was blind and received_sight, until ˱they˲_called the parents ˱of˲_him ˱of˲_which - /having/_received_sight.
\v 19 And ˱they˲_asked them saying, “This is the son ˱of˲_you_all, whom you_all /are/_saying that ˱he˲_/was/_born blind? Therefore how ˱he˲_/is/_seeing now?”
\v 20 Therefore the parents ˱of˲_him answered and said, “˱We˲_/have/_known that this is the son ˱of˲_us, and that ˱he˲_/was/_born blind.
\v 21 But how ˱he˲_/is/_seeing now, ˱we˲_/have/_=> not <=_known, or who opened_up the eyes ˱of˲_him, we /have/_=> not <=_known; ask him, he ˱he˲_/is/_having age, he /will_be/_speaking about himself.”
\v 22 The Parents ˱of˲_him said these \add things\add*, because ˱they˲_/were/_fearing the Jews, for already the Jews /had/_decided that if anyone /may/_confess him /the/_\nd Messiah\nd*, ˱he˲_/may/_become excommunicated.
\v 23 Because_of this the parents ˱of˲_him said, - “/Is/_having age, ask.” him.”
\v 24 ¶ Therefore ˱they˲_called the man who was blind out_of /a/_second \add time\add*, and ˱they˲_said ˱to˲_him, “Give glory - ˱to˲_\nd God\nd*; we /have/_known that this - man is /a/_sinner.”
\v 25 Therefore that \add one\add* answered, “Whether is /a/_sinner ˱I˲_/have/_=> not <=_known. One \add thing\add* ˱I˲_/have/_known, that being blind, now ˱I˲_/am/_seeing.”
\v 26 Therefore ˱they˲_said ˱to˲_him, “What ˱he˲_did ˱to˲_you? How ˱he˲_opened_up the eyes ˱of˲_you?”
\v 27 ˱He˲_answered ˱to˲_them, “˱I˲_told ˱to˲_you_all already, and ˱you_all˲_> not <_heard. Why again /are/_˱you_all˲_wanting /to_be/_hearing? /are/_=> you_all not <=_wanting also /to/_become disciples ˱of˲_him?”
\v 28 And ˱they˲_insulted him, and said, “You are /a/_disciple, ˱of˲_that \add one\add*, but we are disciples - ˱of˲_Moses.
\v 29 We /have/_known that - \nd God\nd* /has/_spoken ˱to˲_Moses, but ˱we˲_/have/_=> not <=_known this \add man\add* from_where ˱he˲_is.”
\v 30 the man answered and said ˱to˲_them, for in this - is /a/_marvelous \add thing\add*, that you_all /have/_=> not <=_known from_where ˱he˲_is, and_yet ˱he˲_opened_up the eyes ˱of˲_me.
\v 31 ˱We˲_/have/_known that - \nd God\nd* /is/_=> not <=_hearing ˱from˲_sinners, but if any may_be God-fearing, and /may_be/_doing the will ˱of˲_him, ˱he˲_/is/_hearing ˱from˲_this \add one\add*.
\v 32 Out_of the age ˱it˲_/was/_=> not <=_heard that anyone opened_up /the/_eyes ˱of˲_> /having_been/_born <_blind.
\v 33 Except - this \add man\add* was from \nd God\nd*, ˱he˲_/was/_=> not <=_able /to_be/_doing nothing.”
\v 34 ˱They˲_answered and said ˱to˲_him, “You /were/_born wholly in sins, and you /are/_teaching us?” And ˱they˲_cast_out him out.
\v 35 \nd Jesus\nd* heard that ˱they˲_cast_out him out, and /having/_found him said, “/Are/_=> you <=_believing in the Son - ˱of˲_Man?”
\v 36 That \add one\add* answered, “And ˱he˲_/was/_saying who is_˱he˲,” “sir, in_order_that ˱I˲_/may/_believe in him?”
\v 37 - \nd Jesus\nd* Said ˱to˲_him, “˱You˲_/have/_=> both <=_seen him, and the \add one\add* speaking with you is that \add one\add*.”
\v 38 And he /was/_saying, “˱I˲_/am/_believing, \nd Lord\nd*”; and ˱he˲_worshipped ˱before˲_him.
\v 39 And - \nd Jesus\nd* said, I came into - this world for judgment, in_order_that the \add ones\add* not seeing, /may_be/_seeing, and the \add ones\add* seeing, /may/_become blind.”
\v 40 The Pharisees heard of these \add things\add* the \add ones\add* being with him, and ˱they˲_said ˱to˲_him, “Also are we not blind?”
\v 41 \nd Jesus\nd* said ˱to˲_them, “If ˱you_all˲_were blind, ˱you_all˲_/were/_=> not <=_having - sin; but now ˱you_all˲_/are/_saying, - ‘˱We˲_/are/_seeing’, the sin ˱of˲_you_all /is/_remaining.
\c 10
\v 1 ¶ Truly, truly, ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all, the \add one\add* not coming_in by the door, to the field ˱of˲_the sheep, but going_up another_way, that \add one\add* is /a/_thief and /a/_robber.
\v 2 But the \add one\add* coming_in by the door, is shepherd ˱of˲_the sheep.
\v 3 ˱To˲_this \add one\add* the doorkeeper /is/_opening_up, and the sheep /is/_hearing ˱of˲_the voice ˱of˲_him, and ˱he˲_/is/_calling his own sheep by name, and /is/_leading_ them _out.
\v 4 Whenever ˱he˲_/may/_send_forth all his own, ˱he˲_/is/_going before them, and the sheep /is/_following ˱after˲_him, because ˱they˲_/have/_known the voice ˱of˲_him.
\v 5 And by_no_means ˱they˲_/may/_=> not <=_follow ˱after˲_/a/_stranger, but ˱they˲_/will_be/_fleeing from him, because ˱they˲_/have/_=> not <=_known the voice - ˱of˲_strangers.”
\v 6 - \nd Jesus\nd* spoke this - allegory ˱to˲_them, but those not knew what_all ˱it˲_was, which ˱he˲_/was/_speaking ˱to˲_them.
\v 7 ¶ Therefore - \nd Jesus\nd* said ˱to˲_them again, “Truly, truly, ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all that I am the door ˱of˲_the sheep.
\v 8 All as_much_as came before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep not heard ˱from˲_them.
\v 9 I am the door; if anyone /may/_come_in by me ˱he˲_/will_be_being/_saved, and /will_be/_coming_in, and /will_be/_coming_out, and /will_be/_finding pasture.
\v 10 The thief /is/_=> not <=_coming, except - in_order_that ˱he˲_/may/_steal, and /may/_sacrifice, and /may/_destroy. I came, in_order_that ˱they˲_/may_be/_having life, and ˱they˲_/may_be/_having \add it\add* abundantly.
\v 11 ¶ I am the - good shepherd. The - good shepherd /is/_laying the life ˱of˲_him for the sheep.
\v 12 The hired_hand even not being /the/_shepherd, ˱of˲_whose sheep is not his own, /is/_observing the wolf coming, and /is/_leaving the sheep and /is/_fleeing, and the wolf /is/_snatching and /is/_scattering them,
\v 13 because ˱he˲_is /a/_hired_hand and /is/_=> not <=_caring ˱to˲_him about the sheep.
\v 14 I am the - good shepherd, and ˱I˲_/am/_knowing - mine, and mine /are/_knowing me -.
\v 15 As the Father /is/_knowing me, and_I /am/_knowing the Father, and ˱I˲_/am/_giving the life ˱of˲_me for the sheep.
\v 16 And ˱I˲_/am/_having other sheep, which is not of this - field; ˱it˲_/is/_fitting me /to/_bring also_those, and ˱they˲_/will_be/_hearing ˱of˲_the voice ˱of˲_me, and ˱they˲_/will_be/_becoming one flock ˱with˲_one, shepherd.
\v 17 Because_of this, the Father /is/_loving me, because I /am/_laying the life ˱of˲_me, in_order_that again ˱I˲_/may/_take it.
\v 18 No_one took_up it from me, but I /am/_laying it of myself. ˱I˲_/am/_having authority /to/_lay it, and ˱I˲_/am/_having authority again /to/_take it. ˱I˲_received this - commandment from the Father ˱of˲_me.”
\v 19 ¶ /A/_division again became among the Jews, because_of - these words.
\v 20 and many of them /were/_saying, “˱He˲_/is/_having /a/_demon, and ˱he˲_/is/_raving_mad; why /are/_˱you_all˲_hearing ˱from˲_him?”
\v 21 Others /were/_saying, “These - sayings is not ˱of˲_being_demon_possessed \add one\add*. /A/_demon /is/_=> not <=_able /to/_open_up /the/_eyes ˱of˲_/the/_blind?”
\v 22 ¶ Then the feast_of_dedication became at - Jerusalem. ˱It˲_was winter,
\v 23 and - \nd Jesus\nd* /was/_walking in the temple, in the portico - ˱of˲_Solomon.
\v 24 Therefore the Jews surrounded him, and ˱they˲_/were/_saying ˱to˲_him, “Until when ˱you˲_/are/_holding_in_suspense the soul ˱of˲_us? If you are the \nd Messiah\nd*, tell ˱to˲_us ˱with˲_plainness.”
\v 25 - \nd Jesus\nd* answered ˱to˲_them, “˱I˲_told ˱to˲_you_all and ˱you_all˲_/are/_=> not <=_believing. The works that I /am/_doing in the name ˱of˲_the Father ˱of˲_me, these \add things\add* /is/_testifying concerning me,
\v 26 but you_all /are/_=> not <=_believing, because ˱you_all˲_are not of - ˱of˲_my - sheep.
\v 27 - my - sheep /are/_hearing ˱of˲_the voice ˱of˲_me, and_I ˱I˲_/am/_knowing them, and ˱they˲_/are/_following ˱after˲_me,
\v 28 and_I /am/_giving eternal life ˱to˲_them, and by_no_means ˱they˲_/may/_=> not <=_perish, for the age, and anyone /will_be/_=> not <=_snatching them out_of the hand ˱of˲_me.
\v 29 The Father ˱of˲_me who /has/_given \add them\add* ˱to˲_me, is greater \add than\add* all, and no_one /is/_able /to_be/_snatching out_of the hand ˱of˲_the Father.
\v 30 I and the Father one are.”
\v 31 ¶ The Jews bore again stones, in_order_that ˱they˲_/may/_stone him.
\v 32 - \nd Jesus\nd* answered ˱to˲_them, “˱I˲_showed many good works ˱to˲_you_all from the Father; ˱of˲_me because_of which work ˱of˲_them, /are/_˱you_all˲_stoning me?”
\v 33 The Jews answered ˱to˲_him, “˱We˲_/are/_=> not <=_stoning you for /a/_good work, but for slander, and because you, /a/_human being, /are/_making yourself \nd God\nd*.”
\v 34 - \nd Jesus\nd* answered ˱to˲_them, “Is_˱it˲ not /having_been/_written in the law ˱of˲_you_all, - ‘I said, “˱You_all˲_are gods”’?
\v 35 If ˱he˲_called those ‘gods’, to whom the word - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd* became (and not /is/_able /to_be/_broken the Scripture),
\v 36 /are/_=> you_all <=_saying whom the Father sanctified and sent_out into the world, - ‘˱You˲_/are/_slandering’, because ˱I˲_said, ‘˱I˲_am /the/_Son - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*’?
\v 37 If ˱I˲_/am/_=> not <=_doing the works ˱of˲_the Father ˱of˲_me, /be/_=> not <=_believing ˱in˲_me;
\v 38 but if ˱I˲_/am/_doing, even_if ˱in˲_me ˱you_all˲_/may_be/_=> not <=_believing, /be/_believing ˱in˲_the works, in_order_that ˱you_all˲_/may/_know and ˱you_all˲_/may_be/_knowing that the Father in me \add is\add*, and_I \add am\add* in the Father.”
\v 39 Therefore ˱they˲_/were/_seeking again /to/_arrest him, but ˱he˲_came_out out_of the hand ˱of˲_them.
\v 40 ¶ And ˱he˲_went_away again beyond the Jordan, to the place where was John - before baptizing, and ˱he˲_remained there.
\v 41 And many came to him, and ˱they˲_/were/_saying, - “John on_one_hand did not_one sign, on_the_other_hand all \add things\add* as_much_as John said concerning this \add man\add* was true.”
\v 42 And many believed in him there.
\c 11
\v 1 ¶ And /a/_certain \add man\add* was ailing, Lazarus of Bethany of the village ˱of˲_Mary, and Martha the sister ˱of˲_her.
\v 2 And Mary was the \add woman\add* /having/_anointed the \nd Lord\nd* ˱with˲_ointment, and /having/_wiped_off the feet ˱of˲_him ˱with˲_the hairs ˱of˲_her, whose - brother Lazarus /was/_ailing.
\v 3 Therefore the sisters sent_out to him saying, “\nd Lord\nd*, behold, ˱he˲_whom ˱you˲_/are/_loving /is/_ailing.”
\v 4 But /having/_heard - \nd Jesus\nd* said, “This - sickness not is to death, but for the glory - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*, in_order_that the Son - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd* /may_be/_glorified by it.”
\v 5 And - \nd Jesus\nd* /was/_loving - Martha, and the sister ˱of˲_her, and - Lazarus.
\v 6 Therefore when ˱he˲_heard that ˱he˲_/is/_ailing, then indeed ˱he˲_remained in /the/_place which ˱he˲_was two days.
\v 7 Then after this ˱he˲_/is/_saying ˱to˲_the disciples, “˱We˲_/may_be/_going into - Judea again.”
\v 8 The Disciples /are/_saying ˱to˲_him, “Rabbi, the Jews /were/_seeking now /to/_stone you, and ˱you˲_/are/_going there again?”
\v 9 \nd Jesus\nd* answered are not Twelve, hours ˱of˲_the day? If anyone /may_be/_walking in the day, ˱he˲_/is/_=> not <=_stumbling, because ˱he˲_/is/_seeing the light - ˱of˲_> this <_world.
\v 10 But if anyone /may_be/_walking in the night, ˱he˲_/is/_stumbling, because the light is not in him.”
\v 11 ˱He˲_said these \add things\add*, and after this ˱he˲_/is/_saying ˱to˲_them, “Lazarus the /the/_friend ˱of˲_us /has_been/_fallen_asleep, but ˱I˲_/am/_going, in_order_that ˱I˲_/may/_awaken him.”
\v 12 Therefore the disciples said ˱to˲_him, “\nd Lord\nd*, if ˱he˲_/has_been/_fallen_asleep ˱he˲_/will_be_being/_healed.”
\v 13 But - \nd Jesus\nd* /had/_spoken about the death ˱of˲_him. But those supposed that ˱he˲_/is/_speaking about the sleep - ˱of˲_sleep.
\v 14 Therefore then - \nd Jesus\nd* said ˱to˲_them ˱with˲_plainness, “Lazarus died_off,
\v 15 and ˱I˲_/am/_rejoicing because_of you_all, that not ˱I˲_was there in_order_that ˱you_all˲_/may/_believe; but ˱we˲_/may_be/_going to him.”
\v 16 Therefore Thomas - /being/_called Didymus said, ˱to˲_the fellow-disciples, “/May_be/_=> we <=_going also, in_order_that ˱we˲_/may/_die_off with him.”
\v 17 ¶ Therefore ¶ /having/_come - \nd Jesus\nd* found him, having already four days. in the tomb.
\v 18 And Bethany was near - Jerusalem, from about fifteen stadiums.
\v 19 And many of the Jews /had/_come to - Martha and Mary, in_order_that ˱they˲_/may/_console them concerning their brother.
\v 20 Therefore - Martha when, ˱she˲_heard that \nd Jesus\nd* /is/_coming, met ˱with˲_him; But Mary /was/_sitting in the house.
\v 21 Therefore - Martha said to - \nd Jesus\nd*, “\nd Lord\nd*, if ˱you˲_were here, the brother ˱of˲_me would not died_off.
\v 22 also now ˱I˲_/have/_known that as_much_as - ˱you˲_/may/_request - \nd God\nd*, - \nd God\nd* /will_be/_giving ˱to˲_you.”
\v 23 - \nd Jesus\nd* /is/_saying ˱to˲_her, the brother ˱of˲_you “/Will_be/_rising_up.”
\v 24 Martha /is/_saying ˱to˲_him, “˱I˲_/have/_known that ˱he˲_/will_be/_rising_up in the resurrection at the last day.”
\v 25 - \nd Jesus\nd* said ˱to˲_her, “I am the resurrection and the life; the \add one\add* believing in me, even_if ˱he˲_/may/_die_off, /will_be/_living,
\v 26 and everyone - living and believing in me, by_no_means /may/_=> not <=_die_off to the age. /Are/_˱you˲_believing this?”
\v 27 ˱She˲_/is/_saying ˱to˲_him, “Yes, \nd Lord\nd*; I /have/_believed that you are the \nd Messiah\nd*, the Son - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*, the \add one\add* coming into the world.”
\v 28 ¶ And /having/_said this ˱she˲_went_away, and called Mary, the sister ˱of˲_her secretly, /having/_said, “The teacher /is/_coming, and ˱he˲_/is/_calling you.”
\v 29 And that \add woman\add* when ˱she˲_heard, ˱she˲_/was/_raised quickly and /was/_coming to him.
\v 30 And - \nd Jesus\nd* /had/_=> not_yet <=_come into the village, but was still at the place where - Martha met ˱with˲_him.
\v 31 Therefore the Jews - being with her in the house and consoling her, /having/_seen that - Mary quickly ˱she˲_rose_up and came_out, ˱they˲_followed ˱after˲_her, /having/_supposed that ˱she˲_/is/_going to the tomb, in_order_that ˱she˲_/may/_weep there.
\v 32 Therefore - Mary, when ˱she˲_came where \nd Jesus\nd* was, /having/_seen him, fell ˱of˲_him at his feet, saying ˱to˲_him, \nd Lord\nd*, if ˱you˲_were here, the brother - ˱of˲_me not died_off.
\v 33 Therefore \nd Jesus\nd* when ˱he˲_saw her weeping, and the \add ones\add* Jews /having/_come_together ˱to˲_her weeping, ˱he˲_groaned ˱in˲_the spirit and disturbed himself.
\v 34 And ˱he˲_said, “Where /have/_˱you_all˲_laid him?” ˱They˲_/are/_saying ˱to˲_him, “\nd Lord\nd*, /be/_coming and see.”
\v 35 - \nd Jesus\nd* wept.
\v 36 Therefore the Jews /were/_saying, “Behold, how ˱he˲_/was/_loving him!”
\v 37 But some of them said, “This \add man\add* the \add one\add* /having/_opened_up the eyes ˱of˲_the blind \add man\add* /was/_=> not <=_able, /to/_=> also <=_make that this \add one\add* /may/_=> not <=_die_off?”
\v 38 ¶ Therefore \nd Jesus\nd* again groaning in himself, /is/_coming to the tomb. And ˱it˲_was /a/_cave, and /a/_stone /was/_laying_on against it.
\v 39 - \nd Jesus\nd* /is/_saying, “Take_away the stone.” Martha the /the/_sister ˱of˲_the \add one\add* /having/_died /is/_saying ˱to˲_him, “\nd Lord\nd*, ˱he˲_/is/_=> already <=_stinking, for ˱it˲_is /the/_fourth \add day\add*.”
\v 40 - \nd Jesus\nd* /is/_saying ˱to˲_her, “Not ˱I˲_said ˱to˲_you that if ˱you˲_/may/_believe, ˱you˲_/will_be/_seeing the glory - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*?”
\v 41 Therefore ˱they˲_took_away the stone. And - \nd Jesus\nd* lifted_up his eyes upward, and said, “Father, ˱I˲_/am/_giving_thanks ˱to˲_you that ˱you˲_heard ˱from˲_me.
\v 42 And I /had/_known that always ˱you˲_/are/_hearing ˱from˲_me, but because_of the crowd - /having/_stood_around, ˱I˲_said \add it\add*, in_order_that ˱they˲_/may/_believe that you sent_ me _out.”
\v 43 And /having/_said these \add things\add*, ˱with˲_/a/_=> loud <=_voice ˱he˲_cried_out, “Lazarus, come out.”
\v 44 the \add one\add* /having/_died Came_out, his feet and his hands /having_been/_bound ˱with˲_linen_strips, and the face ˱of˲_him /had_been/_bound_about. ˱with˲_/a/_handkerchief. - \nd Jesus\nd* /is/_saying ˱to˲_them, “Release him and allow him /to_be/_going.”
\v 45 Therefore many of the Jews, - /having/_come to - Mary, and /having/_seen what ˱he˲_did, ˱they˲_believed in him.
\v 46 But some of them went_away to the Pharisees, and told ˱to˲_them what \nd Jesus\nd* did.
\v 47 Therefore the chief_priests and the Pharisees gathered_together /the/_Sanhedrin, and ˱they˲_/were/_saying, “What /are/_˱we˲_doing, because this - man /is/_doing many signs?
\v 48 If ˱we˲_/may/_allow him thus, all /will_be/_believing in him, and the Romans /will_be/_coming, and ˱they˲_/will_be/_taking_away ˱of˲_us both the place and the nation.”
\v 49 But /a/_=> one <=_certain of them, Caiaphas being chief_priest - year that, said ˱to˲_them, “You_all /have/_=> not <=_known nothing!
\v 50 Nor ˱you_all˲_/are/_reckoning that ˱it˲_/is/_benefitting ˱for˲_you_all that one man /may/_die_off for the people, and not all the nation /may/_perish.”
\v 51 And ˱he˲_said this not from himself, but being chief_priest - that year, ˱he˲_prophesied that \nd Jesus\nd* /was/_going /to_be/_dying_off for the nation,
\v 52 and not only for the nation, but in_order_that also the children - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*, the \add ones\add* /having_been/_scattered /may/_gather_together into one.
\v 53 Therefore from that - day, ˱they˲_counselled that ˱they˲_/may/_kill_ him _off.
\v 54 therefore ¶ - \nd Jesus\nd* no_longer /was/_walking ˱in˲_public among the Jews, but went_away from_there into the region near the desert, to /a/_city /being/_called Ephraim, and_there ˱he˲_remained with the disciples.
\v 55 ¶ And the Passover ˱of˲_the Jews was near, and many went_up to Jerusalem out_of the region before the Passover, in_order_that ˱they˲_/may/_purify themselves.
\v 56 Therefore ˱they˲_/were/_seeking - \nd Jesus\nd*, and ˱they˲_/were/_saying with one_another /having/_stood in the temple, “What ˱it˲_/is/_supposing ˱to˲_you_all? That by_no_means ˱he˲_/may/_=> not <=_come to the feast?”
\v 57 And /had/_given the chief_priests and the Pharisees commandments, that if anyone /may/_know where ˱he˲_is, ˱he˲_/may/_divulge \add it\add*, so_that ˱they˲_/may/_arrest him.
\c 12
\v 1 ¶ Therefore - Six days before the Passover \nd Jesus\nd*, came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, whom \nd Jesus\nd* raised from /the/_dead.
\v 2 Therefore ˱they˲_made /a/_supper ˱for˲_him there, and - Martha /was/_serving, and - Lazarus was one of the \add ones\add* reclining with him.
\v 3 Therefore - Mary /having/_taken /a/_pound ˱of˲_ointment ˱of˲_> precious genuine <_nard, anointed the feet - ˱of˲_\nd Jesus\nd*, and wiped_off the feet ˱of˲_him ˱with˲_the hairs ˱of˲_her; and the house /was/_filled with the aroma ˱of˲_the ointment.
\v 4 But Judas - Iscariot, one ˱of˲_the disciples ˱of˲_him, the \add one\add* going /to_be/_giving_ him _over, /is/_saying,
\v 5 “for_ Why _reason this - ointment /was/_=> not <=_sold ˱for˲_three_hundred denarii, and /was/_given ˱to˲_/the/_poor?”
\v 6 But ˱he˲_said this, not that /was/_caring ˱to˲_him for the poor, but because ˱he˲_was /a/_thief, and having the moneybag /was/_bearing the \add money\add* /being/_cast \add in\add*.
\v 7 Therefore - \nd Jesus\nd* said, “Allow her, in_order_that ˱she˲_/may/_keep it for the day ˱of˲_the burial ˱of˲_me.
\v 8 For ˱you_all˲_/are/_=> always <=_having the poor with yourselves, but ˱you_all˲_/are/_=> not always <=_having me.”
\v 9 ¶ Therefore - /a/_=> great <=_crowd of the Jews knew that ˱he˲_is there, and ˱they˲_came, not only because_of - \nd Jesus\nd*, but in_order_that ˱they˲_/may/_=> also <=_see - Lazarus, whom ˱he˲_raised from /the/_dead.
\v 10 But the chief_priests counselled that ˱they˲_/may/_kill_off - Lazarus also,
\v 11 because many ˱of˲_the Jews /were/_going_away because_of him, and ˱they˲_/were/_believing in - \nd Jesus\nd*.
\v 12 ¶ ˱On˲_the \add day\add* of_next the great crowd, the \add one\add* /having/_come to the feast, /having/_heard that - \nd Jesus\nd* /is/_coming into Jerusalem,
\v 13 ˱they˲_took - palm_branches ˱of˲_the palm_trees and came_out in meeting ˱to˲_him, and ˱they˲_/were/_crying_out, “‘Hosanna! /Having_been/_blessed \add is\add* the \add one\add* coming in /the/_name ˱of˲_/the/_\nd Lord\nd*’, and the King - ˱of˲_Israel!”
\v 14 And - \nd Jesus\nd* /having/_found /a/_little_donkey, sat_down on it, as is /having_been/_written,
\v 15 “/be/_=> not <=_fearing, daughter ˱of˲_Zion; behold, the king ˱of˲_you /is/_coming, sitting on /a/_colt ˱of˲_/a/_donkey.”
\v 16 The Disciples ˱of˲_him not knew these \add things\add* ˱from˲_the first, but when \nd Jesus\nd* /was/_glorified, then ˱they˲_/were/_reminded that these \add things\add* was /having_been/_written concerning him, and ˱they˲_did these \add things\add* ˱to˲_him.
\v 17 Therefore the crowd /was/_testifying - being with him, when ˱he˲_called - Lazarus out_of the tomb, and raised him from /the/_dead.
\v 18 Because_of this the crowd also met ˱with˲_him, because ˱they˲_heard ˱about˲_him /to_have/_done - this sign.
\v 19 Therefore the Pharisees said to themselves, “˱You_all˲_/are/_observing that ˱you_all˲_/are/_=> not <=_benefiting nothing; behold, the world went_away after him.”
\v 20 ¶ And Greeks were some of the \add ones\add* going_up, in_order_that ˱they˲_/may/_worship at the feast;
\v 21 therefore these approached ˱to˲_Philip, who from Bethsaida - ˱of˲_Galilee, and ˱they˲_/were/_asking him saying, “Sir, ˱we˲_/are/_wanting /to/_see - \nd Jesus\nd*.”
\v 22 - Philip /is/_coming and ˱he˲_/is/_telling - ˱to˲_Andrew, Andrew and Philip /is/_coming and ˱they˲_/are/_telling - ˱to˲_\nd Jesus\nd*.
\v 23 And - \nd Jesus\nd* /is/_answering ˱to˲_them saying, “The hour /has/_come, in_order_that the Son - ˱of˲_Man /may_be/_glorified.
\v 24 Truly, truly, ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all, if the seed - ˱of˲_wheat /may/_=> not <=_die_off /having/_fallen into the ground, only it /is/_remaining; but if ˱it˲_/may/_die_off, ˱it˲_/is/_bearing much fruit.
\v 25 The \add one\add* loving the life ˱of˲_him, /is/_losing it, and the \add one\add* hating the life ˱of˲_him in - this world, /will_be/_keeping it to eternal life.
\v 26 If anyone /may_be/_serving ˱unto˲_me, ˱him˲_/let_be/_following ˱after˲_me, and where am I, there also - - my servant will_be. If anyone /may_be/_serving ˱unto˲_me, the Father /will_be/_honoring him.
\v 27 ¶ Now the soul ˱of˲_me /has_been/_disturbed, and what /may/_˱I˲_say, ‘Father, save me from - this hour’? But because_of this, ˱I˲_came to - this hour.
\v 28 Father, glorify the name ˱of˲_you.” Therefore /a/_voice came out_of - heaven: “Both ˱I˲_glorified \add it\add*, and ˱I˲_/will_be/_glorifying \add it\add* again.”
\v 29 Therefore the crowd - /having/_stood and /having/_heard, /was/_saying thunder /to_have/_become. Others /were/_saying, “/An/_angel /has/_spoken ˱to˲_him.”
\v 30 \nd Jesus\nd* answered and said, this - voice /has/_become not because_of me, but because_of you_all.
\v 31 Now is /the/_judgment - ˱of˲_> this <_world, now the ruler - ˱of˲_> this <_world /will_be_being/_cast_out out.
\v 32 And_I if /may_be/_exalted from the earth, ˱I˲_/will_be/_drawing all to myself.”
\v 33 But ˱he˲_/was/_saying this, signifying ˱by˲_what death ˱he˲_/was/_going /to_be/_dying_off.
\v 34 Therefore the crowd answered ˱to˲_him, “We heard out_of the law that the \nd Messiah\nd* /is/_remaining to the age, and how /are/_saying you that ˱it˲_/is/_fitting the Son - ˱of˲_Man /to_be/_exalted? Who is this - Son - ˱of˲_Man?”
\v 35 Therefore - \nd Jesus\nd* said ˱to˲_them, “The light is with you_all still /a/_little time. /be/_walking while ˱you_all˲_/are/_having the light, in_order_that you_all /may/_=> not <=_grasp darkness, and the \add one\add* walking in the darkness, /has/_=> not <=_known where ˱he˲_/is/_going.
\v 36 While ˱you_all˲_/are/_having the light, /be/_believing in the light, in_order_that ˱you_all˲_/may/_become sons ˱of˲_light.” \nd Jesus\nd* spoke these \add things\add*, and /having/_gone_away, /was/_hidden from them.
\v 37 But /having/_done so_many signs ˱of˲_him before them, ˱they˲_/were/_=> not <=_believing in him,
\v 38 in_order_that the word ˱of˲_Isaiah the prophet /may_be/_fulfilled that ˱he˲_said, “\nd Lord\nd*, who believed ˱in˲_the report ˱of˲_us? And ˱to˲_whom /was/_revealed the arm ˱of˲_/the/_\nd Lord\nd*?”
\v 39 Because_of this ˱they˲_/were/_=> not <=_able /to_be/_believing, because again Isaiah said,
\v 40 “˱he˲_/has/_blinded the eyes ˱of˲_them and ˱he˲_maimed the heart ˱of˲_them, in_order_that ˱they˲_/may/_=> not <=_see ˱with˲_their eyes and ˱they˲_/may/_understand ˱with˲_their heart, and ˱they˲_/may_be/_turned and ˱I˲_/will_be/_healing them.”
\v 41 Isaiah said these \add things\add*, because ˱he˲_saw the glory ˱of˲_him, and spoke concerning him.
\v 42 Likewise however even many from ˱of˲_the rulers believed in him, but because_of the Pharisees ˱they˲_/were/_=> not <=_confessing, in_order_that ˱they˲_> not <_/may/_become excommunicated.
\v 43 For ˱they˲_loved the glory - ˱of˲_humans more than the glory - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*.
\v 44 and \nd Jesus\nd* cried_out and said, “The \add one\add* believing in me, /is/_=> not <=_believing in me, but in the \add one\add* /having/_sent me,
\v 45 and the \add one\add* observing me, /is/_observing the \add one\add* /having/_sent me.
\v 46 I /have/_come into the world ˱as˲_/a/_light, in_order_that everyone - believing in me, in the darkness /may/_=> not <=_remain.
\v 47 And if anyone /may/_hear ˱of˲_the words ˱of˲_me, and not /may/_keep \add them\add*, I /am/_=> not <=_judging him, for ˱I˲_came not, in_order_that ˱I˲_/may/_judge the world, but in_order_that ˱I˲_/may/_save the world.
\v 48 The \add one\add* rejecting me and not receiving the words ˱of˲_me, /is/_having the \add one\add* judging him; the word which ˱I˲_spoke, that /will_be/_judging him at the last day.
\v 49 Because I spoke not from myself, but the Father himself /having/_sent me ˱to˲_me /has/_given /a/_commandment– what ˱I˲_/may/_say, and what ˱I˲_/may/_speak.
\v 50 And ˱I˲_/have/_known that the commandment ˱of˲_him is eternal life. Therefore what I /am/_speaking, as the Father /has/_said ˱to˲_me, thus ˱I˲_/am/_speaking.”
\c 13
\v 1 ¶ And before the feast ˱of˲_the Passover, - \nd Jesus\nd* /having/_known that the hour ˱of˲_him came, that ˱he˲_/may/_depart out_of - this world to the Father, /having/_loved his own who \add were\add* in the world, ˱he˲_loved them to /the/_end.
\v 2 And becoming, supper, the devil already /having/_put into the heart Judas ˱of˲_Simon Iscariot that /may/_give_ him _over,
\v 3 /having/_known that the Father /has/_given all \add things\add* ˱to˲_him, into his hands, and that ˱he˲_came_out from \nd God\nd* and ˱he˲_/is/_going to - \nd God\nd*,
\v 4 ˱he˲_/is_being/_raised from the supper and /is/_laying \add aside\add* his clothes, and /having/_taken /a/_linen_towel ˱he˲_girded himself.
\v 5 Thereafter ˱he˲_/is/_putting water into the wash_basin, and began /to_be/_washing the feet ˱of˲_the disciples, and /to_be/_wiping_off \add them\add* ˱with˲_the linen_towel ˱with˲_which ˱he˲_was /having_been/_girded.
\v 6 Therefore ˱he˲_/is/_coming to Simon Peter. ˱He˲_/is/_saying ˱to˲_him, “\nd Lord\nd*, /are/_=> you <=_washing the feet ˱of˲_me?”
\v 7 \nd Jesus\nd* answered and said ˱to˲_him, “What I /am/_doing, you ˱you˲_/have/_=> not <=_known now, but ˱you˲_/will_be/_knowing after these \add things\add*.”
\v 8 Peter /is/_saying ˱to˲_him, “By_no_means ˱you˲_/may/_=> not <=_wash the feet ˱of˲_me to the age.” \nd Jesus\nd* answered ˱to˲_him, “If ˱I˲_/may/_=> not <=_wash you, /are/_=> not <=_having part with me.”
\v 9 Simon Peter /is/_saying ˱to˲_him, “\nd Lord\nd*, not only the feet ˱of˲_me, but also my hands and my head.”
\v 10 - \nd Jesus\nd* /is/_saying ˱to˲_him, “The \add one\add* /having_been/_washed /is/_=> not <=_having need, except /to/_wash - the feet, but ˱he˲_is all clean; and you_all are clean, but not all.”
\v 11 For ˱he˲_/had/_known the \add one\add* giving_ him _over; because_of this ˱he˲_said, - “˱You_all˲_are not all clean.”
\v 12 ¶ Therefore when ˱he˲_washed the feet ˱of˲_them, took the clothes ˱of˲_him, and sat_down, again ˱he˲_said ˱to˲_them, “/Are/_˱you_all˲_knowing what ˱I˲_/have/_done ˱to˲_you_all?
\v 13 You_all /are/_calling me - ‘Teacher’ and, - ‘\nd Lord\nd*’, and ˱you_all˲_/are/_saying rightly, for ˱I˲_am.
\v 14 Therefore if I the \nd Lord\nd* and the Teacher washed the feet ˱of˲_you_all, you_all also /are/_ought /to_be/_washing the feet ˱of˲_one_another.
\v 15 For ˱I˲_/have/_given ˱to˲_you_all /an/_example that as I did ˱to˲_you_all, you_all also /may_be/_doing.
\v 16 Truly, truly, ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all, is not /a/_slave greater \add than\add* the master ˱of˲_him, nor /an/_ambassador greater \add than\add* the \add one\add* /having/_sent him.
\v 17 If ˱you_all˲_/have/_known these \add things\add*, ˱you_all˲_are blessed if ˱you_all˲_/may_be/_doing them.
\v 18 ˱I˲_/am/_speaking not about all ˱of˲_you_all. I /have/_known whom_all ˱I˲_chose, but in_order_that the Scripture /may_be/_fulfilled, ‘the \add one\add* eating the bread with me, lifted_up the heel ˱of˲_him against me.’
\v 19 From now ˱I˲_/am/_telling ˱to˲_you_all before the \add time\add* /to/_become, in_order_that ˱you_all˲_/may/_believe whenever ˱it˲_/may/_become that I am \add he\add*.
\v 20 Truly, truly, ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all, the \add one\add* receiving - anyone ˱I˲_/may/_send, /is/_receiving me, and the \add one\add* receiving me, /is/_receiving the \add one\add* /having/_sent me.”
\v 21 ¶ /Having/_said these \add things\add*, - \nd Jesus\nd* /was/_disturbed - ˱in˲_spirit and testified and said, “Truly, truly, ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all that one of you_all /will_be/_giving_ me _over.”
\v 22 Therefore the disciples /were/_looking among one_another, perplexing about whom ˱he˲_/is/_speaking.
\v 23 And one out_of the disciples whom - \nd Jesus\nd* /was/_loving was reclining in the bosom ˱of˲_him - ˱of˲_\nd Jesus\nd*.
\v 24 Therefore Simon Peter /is/_nodding ˱to˲_this \add one\add*, /to/_inquire who - ˱it˲_might_be about whom ˱he˲_/is/_speaking.
\v 25 therefore that \add one\add* /Having/_leaned_back thus on the chest - ˱of˲_\nd Jesus\nd*, /is/_saying ˱to˲_him, “\nd Lord\nd*, who is_˱it˲?”
\v 26 \nd Jesus\nd* /is/_answering, “That \add one\add* is ˱to˲_whom I, /having/_dipped the piece_of_bread /will_be/_handing_out \add it\add*.” And /having/_dipped the piece_of_bread, ˱he˲_/is/_giving ˱to˲_Judas ˱of˲_Simon Iscariot.
\v 27 And after the piece_of_bread, then - Satan came_in into that \add one\add*. Therefore - \nd Jesus\nd* /is/_saying ˱to˲_him, “What ˱you˲_/are/_doing, do more_quickly.”
\v 28 And no_one ˱of˲_the \add ones\add* reclining knew, to what ˱he˲_said this ˱to˲_him.
\v 29 For some /were/_supposing, from Judas /was/_having the moneybag, that - \nd Jesus\nd* /is/_saying ˱to˲_him, “Buy ˱of˲_what \add things\add* ˱we˲_/are/_having need for the feast”, or in_order_that something /may/_give ˱to˲_the poor.
\v 30 Therefore /having/_received the piece_of_bread, that \add one\add* came_out immediately. And ˱it˲_was night.
\v 31 ¶ Therefore when ˱he˲_came_out, \nd Jesus\nd* /is/_saying, “Now the Son - ˱of˲_Man /was/_glorified, and - \nd God\nd* /was/_glorified in him.
\v 32 Also - \nd God\nd* /will_be/_glorifying him in himself, and immediately /will_be/_glorifying him.
\v 33 Little_children, ˱I˲_am still /a/_little \add time\add* with you_all. ˱You_all˲_/will_be/_seeking me, and as ˱I˲_said ˱to˲_the Jews, - ‘Where I /am/_going, you_all /are/_=> not <=_being_able /to/_come’, now ˱I˲_/am/_=> also <=_saying ˱to˲_you_all.
\v 34 ˱I˲_/am/_giving ˱to˲_you_all /a/_=> new <=_commandment, that ˱you_all˲_/may_be/_loving one_another, as ˱I˲_loved you_all, that also you_all /may_be/_loving one_another.
\v 35 By this all /will_be/_knowing that ˱you_all˲_are my disciples, if ˱you_all˲_/may_be/_having love among one_another.”
\v 36 ¶ Simon Peter /is/_saying ˱to˲_him, “\nd Lord\nd*, where ˱you˲_/are/_going?” \nd Jesus\nd* answered ˱to˲_him, “Where ˱I˲_/am/_going, ˱you˲_/are/_=> not <=_being_able /to/_follow ˱after˲_me now, but ˱you˲_/will_be/_following later.”
\v 37 - Peter /is/_saying ˱to˲_him, “\nd Lord\nd*, for_ why _reason ˱I˲_/am/_=> not <=_being_able /to/_follow ˱after˲_you now? ˱I˲_/will_be/_laying \add down\add* the life ˱of˲_me for you.”
\v 38 \nd Jesus\nd* /Is/_answering, “/Will_˱you˲_/be_laying the life ˱of˲_you for me? Truly, truly, ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you, by_no_means /the/_rooster /may/_=> not <=_crow, until ˱of˲_which ˱you˲_/will_be/_disowning me thrice.
\c 14
\v 1 ¶ Not /let_be_being/_disturbed the heart ˱of˲_you_all; ˱you˲_/are/_believing in - \nd God\nd*, also ˱you˲_/are/_believing in me.
\v 2 Many dwellings are in the house ˱of˲_the Father ˱of˲_me; and if not, ˱I˲_> would <_told ˱to˲_you_all, because ˱I˲_/am/_going /to/_prepare /a/_place ˱for˲_you_all.
\v 3 And if ˱I˲_/may_be/_gone and ˱I˲_/may/_prepare you_all /a/_place ˱I˲_/am/_coming again and ˱I˲_/will_be/_receiving you_all to myself, in_order_that where am I, you_all may_be also.
\v 4 And ˱you_all˲_/have/_known the way where I /am/_going.”
\v 5 Thomas /is/_saying ˱to˲_him, “\nd Lord\nd*, ˱we˲_/have/_=> not <=_known where ˱you˲_/are/_going; how /are/_˱we˲_being_able /to_have/_known the way?”
\v 6 \nd Jesus\nd* /is/_saying ˱to˲_him, “I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No_one /is/_coming to the Father, except - by me.
\v 7 If ˱you_all˲_/had/_known me, ˱you_all˲_> also <_/will_be/_knowing the Father ˱of˲_me, and from now ˱you_all˲_/are/_knowing him and ˱you_all˲_/have/_seen him.”
\v 8 Philip /is/_saying ˱to˲_him, “\nd Lord\nd*, show the Father ˱to˲_us, and ˱it˲_/is/_sufficing ˱for˲_us.”

\v 17 Therefore the disciples of ˱of˲_him said to one_another, “What is this that ˱he˲_/is/_saying ˱to˲_us, ‘/A/_little \add time\add* and ˱you_all˲_/are/_=> not <=_observing me, and again /a/_little \add time\add* and ˱you_all˲_/will_be/_seeing me; and Because ˱I˲_/am/_going to the Father’?”

\v 26 And ˱I˲_made_known ˱to˲_them the name ˱of˲_you, and ˱I˲_/will_be/_making_known \add it\add*, in_order_that the love which ˱you˲_loved me, may_be in them, and_I in them.”
\c 18
\v 1 ¶ /Having/_said these \add things\add*, \nd Jesus\nd* came_out with the disciples ˱of˲_him beyond the winter_stream ˱of˲_the Kedron, where was /a/_garden, into which he and the disciples ˱of˲_him came_in.
\v 2 And Judas who giving_ him _over /had/_=> also <=_known, the place, because often \nd Jesus\nd* /was/_gathered_together There with the disciples ˱of˲_him.
\v 3 therefore - Judas /having/_received the cohort, and attendants from the chief_priests and Pharisees, /is/_coming there with lanterns, and torches, and weapons.
\v 4 \nd Jesus\nd* and /having/_known all the \add things\add* coming on him, /having/_come_out ˱he˲_said ˱to˲_them, “Whom /are/_˱you_all˲_seeking?”
\v 5 ˱They˲_answered ˱to˲_him, “\nd Jesus\nd* the Nazarene.” \nd Jesus\nd* ˱he˲_/is/_saying ˱to˲_them, “I am \add he\add*.” and also Judas, who giving_ him _over /had/_stood, with them.
\v 6 Therefore when ˱he˲_said ˱to˲_them, “I am \add he\add*”, ˱they˲_went_away back to the \add things\add* and ˱they˲_fell on_the_ground.
\v 7 Therefore again ˱he˲_asked them, “Whom /are/_˱you_all˲_seeking?” And they said, “\nd Jesus\nd* the Nazarene.”
\v 8 Answered \nd Jesus\nd*, “˱I˲_told ˱to˲_you_all that I am \add he\add*. Therefore if ˱you_all˲_/are/_seeking me, allow these /to_be/_going_away”;
\v 9 in_order_that the word /may_be/_fulfilled that ˱he˲_said, - “whom ˱you˲_/have/_given ˱to˲_me, ˱I˲_> not <_lost no_one of them.”
\v 10 Therefore Simon Peter having /a/_sword, drew it and struck the slave ˱of˲_the chief_priest, and cut_off the - right ear ˱of˲_him. And was Malchus /the/_name ˱to˲_the slave.
\v 11 Therefore - \nd Jesus\nd* said - ˱to˲_Peter, “Put the sword into the sheath; the cup which the Father /has/_given ˱to˲_me, by_no_means ˱I˲_/may/_=> not <=_drink it?”
\v 12 ¶ Therefore the cohort, and the commander, and the attendants ˱of˲_the Jews, captured - \nd Jesus\nd* and bound him.
\v 13 And ˱they˲_led \add him\add* to Annas first, for ˱he˲_was father_in_law - ˱of˲_Caiaphas, who was chief_priest - ˱of˲_> that <_year.
\v 14 And Caiaphas was the \add one\add* /having/_counselled ˱to˲_the Jews that ˱it˲_/is/_benefitting ˱for˲_one man /to/_die_off for the people.
\v 15 ¶ And Simon Peter and /the/_other disciple /was/_following. - ˱with˲_\nd Jesus\nd*. And - that disciple was known ˱to˲_the chief_priest, and ˱he˲_entered_with - ˱with˲_\nd Jesus\nd* into the courtyard ˱of˲_the chief_priest.
\v 16 But - Peter /had/_stood at the door outside. Therefore the - other disciple came_out which was known ˱of˲_the chief_priest, and ˱he˲_spoke ˱to˲_the doorkeeper and brought_in - Peter.
\v 17 The servant_girl the doorkeeper /is/_saying therefore, - ˱to˲_Peter, “Are you not also of the disciples - ˱of˲_> this <_man?” That \add one\add* ˱he˲_/is/_saying, “˱I˲_am not.”
\v 18 And the slaves and the attendants /had/_stood, /having/_made /a/_charcoal_fire, because ˱it˲_was cold, and ˱they˲_/were/_warming \add themselves\add*; and - Peter was also with them /having/_stood and warming \add himself\add*.
\v 19 ¶ Therefore the chief_priest asked - \nd Jesus\nd* concerning the disciples ˱of˲_him, and concerning the teaching ˱of˲_him.
\v 20 \nd Jesus\nd* answered ˱to˲_him, “I /have/_spoken ˱with˲_plainness ˱to˲_the world; I always taught in /the/_synagogue and in the temple, where all the Jews /are/_coming_together, and ˱I˲_spoke nothing in secret.
\v 21 Why /are/_˱you˲_asking me? Ask the \add ones\add* /having/_heard what ˱I˲_spoke ˱to˲_them; behold, these /have/_known what I said.”
\v 22 And these \add things\add* ˱of˲_him /having/_said, one ˱of˲_the \add ones\add* attendants /having/_stood_by gave /a/_slap - ˱to˲_\nd Jesus\nd* /having/_said, “/Are/_˱you˲_answering thus ˱to˲_the chief_priest?”
\v 23 \nd Jesus\nd* answered ˱to˲_him, “If ˱I˲_spoke wrongly, testify concerning the evil; but if rightly, why /are/_˱you˲_beating me?”
\v 24 Therefore - Annas sent_ him _out, /having_been/_bound to Caiaphas the chief_priest.
\v 25 ¶ And Simon Peter was /having/_stood and warming \add himself\add*. Therefore ˱they˲_said ˱to˲_him, “Are not you also of the disciples ˱of˲_him?” That \add one\add* ˱he˲_disowned and said, “˱I˲_am not.”
\v 26 one of the slaves ˱of˲_the chief_priest, being /a/_relative ˱of˲_whom Peter cut_off his ear /Is/_saying, “Not I saw you in the garden with him?”
\v 27 Therefore again Peter disowned, and immediately /a/_rooster crowed.
\v 28 ¶ Therefore ˱they˲_/are/_leading - \nd Jesus\nd* from - Caiaphas into the praetorium; and ˱it˲_was early. And they not came_in into the praetorium, in_order_that ˱they˲_/may_ not _be/_defiled, but ˱they˲_/may/_eat the Passover.
\v 29 Therefore - Pilate came_out outside to them and /is/_saying, “What accusation /are/_˱you_all˲_bringing against this - man?”
\v 30 ˱They˲_answered and said ˱to˲_him, “Except - this \add one\add* was doing evil, ˱we˲_> would not <_gave_over him ˱to˲_you
\v 31 Therefore Pilate said ˱to˲_them, “You_all take him, and judge according_to the law ˱of˲_you_all, him.” The Jews said ˱to˲_him, /is/_=> not <=_permitting “˱To˲_us /to/_kill_off no_one”;
\v 32 in_order_that the word - ˱of˲_\nd Jesus\nd* /may_be/_fulfilled, that ˱he˲_spoke, signifying ˱by˲_what death ˱he˲_/was/_going /to_be/_dying_off.
\v 33 ¶ Therefore - Pilate came_in again into the praetorium, and ˱he˲_called - \nd Jesus\nd* and said ˱to˲_him, “Are you the king ˱of˲_the Jews?”
\v 34 \nd Jesus\nd* answered “/Are/_=> you <=_saying this of yourself, or others said \add it\add* ˱to˲_you concerning me?”
\v 35 - Pilate answered, “Surely_not am I /a/_Jew? - Your - nation and the chief_priests gave_ you _over ˱to˲_me. What did_˱you˲?”
\v 36 \nd Jesus\nd* answered, “- my - kingdom is not of - world this; if - my - kingdom was of this - world, - my - attendants would /were/_fighting, in_order_that ˱I˲_/may_ not _be/_given_over ˱to˲_the Jews. But now - my - kingdom is not from_here.”
\v 37 Therefore - Pilate said ˱to˲_him, “Are you not_then /a/_king?” - \nd Jesus\nd* answered, “You /are/_saying that I am /a/_king. for this ˱I˲_/have_been/_born, and for this ˱I˲_/have/_come into the world, in_order_that ˱I˲_/may/_testify ˱to˲_the truth. Everyone - being of the truth, /is/_hearing ˱of˲_the voice ˱of˲_me.”
\v 38 - Pilate /is/_saying ˱to˲_him, “What is truth?” ¶ And /having/_said this, ˱he˲_came_out again to the Jews, and /is/_saying ˱to˲_them, “I /am/_finding not_one Guilt in him.
\v 39 But ˱it˲_is /a/_custom ˱with˲_you_all, that ˱I˲_/may/_send_away one ˱to˲_you_all at the Passover; therefore /are/_˱you_all˲_wishing ˱I˲_/may/_send_away ˱to˲_you_all the King ˱of˲_the Jews?”
\v 40 Therefore ˱they˲_cried_out again saying, “Not this \add one\add*, but - Barabbas!” And - Barabbas was /a/_robber.
\c 19
\v 1 ¶ Therefore - Pilate then took - \nd Jesus\nd* and flogged \add him\add*.
\v 2 And the soldiers /having/_twisted_together /a/_crown of thorns, ˱they˲_put_on \add it\add* ˱on˲_the head ˱of˲_him, and ˱they˲_clothed him ˱in˲_/a/_=> purple <=_robe,
\v 3 and ˱they˲_/were/_coming to him and ˱they˲_/were/_saying, “Hail, the King ˱of˲_the Jews!” And ˱they˲_/were/_giving slaps ˱to˲_him.
\v 4 And - Pilate came_out again outside, and /is/_saying ˱to˲_them, “Behold, ˱I˲_/am/_bringing him out ˱to˲_you_all, in_order_that ˱you_all˲_/may/_know that ˱I˲_/am/_=> not <=_finding guilt in him.”
\v 5 Therefore - \nd Jesus\nd* came_out outside, wearing the thorny crown and the purple robe. And ˱he˲_/is/_saying ˱to˲_them, “Behold, the man!”
\v 6 Therefore when the chief_priests and the attendants saw him, ˱they˲_cried_out saying, “Crucify! Crucify!” - Pilate /is/_saying ˱to˲_them, “You_all take him and crucify \add him\add*, for I /am/_=> not <=_finding guilt in him.”
\v 7 The Jews answered, “We /are/_having /a/_law, and according_to the law ˱he˲_ought /to/_die_off, because ˱he˲_made himself /the/_Son ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*.”
\v 8 ¶ Therefore when - Pilate heard this - word, ˱he˲_/was/_=> more <=_afraid.
\v 9 And ˱he˲_came_in into the praetorium again, and /is/_saying - ˱to˲_\nd Jesus\nd*, “From_where are you?” But - \nd Jesus\nd* not gave /an/_answer ˱to˲_him.
\v 10 Therefore - Pilate /is/_saying ˱to˲_him, ˱you˲_/are/_=> not <=_speaking “˱To˲_me? ˱You˲_/have/_=> not <=_known that ˱I˲_/am/_having authority /to/_send_ you _away, and ˱I˲_/am/_having authority /to/_crucify you?”
\v 11 \nd Jesus\nd* answered ˱to˲_him, “˱You˲_/were/_=> not <=_having authority against me not_one, except - was /having_been/_given ˱to˲_you from_above. Because_of this the \add one\add* /having/_given_ me _over ˱to˲_you, /is/_having greater sin.”
\v 12 Out_of this - Pilate /was/_seeking /to/_send_away him. But the Jews cried_out saying, “If ˱you˲_/may/_send_away this \add man\add*, ˱you˲_are not /a/_friend - ˱of˲_Caesar. Everyone making himself - /a/_king, /is/_speaking_against - ˱against˲_Caesar.”
\v 13 ¶ Therefore - Pilate, /having/_heard - ˱of˲_words these, brought outside - \nd Jesus\nd*, and ˱he˲_sat_down on /the/_tribunal, at /a/_place /being/_called /the/_Stone_Pavement, But in_Hebrew, Gabbatha.
\v 14 And ˱it˲_was /the/_Preparation \add day\add* ˱of˲_the Passover, /the/_hour was about /the/_sixth. And ˱he˲_/is/_saying ˱to˲_the Jews, “Behold, the king ˱of˲_you_all!”
\v 15 And they cried_out, “Take_away! Take_away! Crucify him!” - Pilate /is/_saying ˱to˲_them, “/May/_˱I˲_crucify the king ˱of˲_you_all?” The Chief_priests answered, “˱We˲_/are/_=> not <=_having /a/_king, except - Caesar.”
\v 16 Therefore then ˱he˲_gave_ him _over, ˱to˲_them, in_order_that ˱he˲_/may_be/_crucified. ¶ ˱They˲_took And - \nd Jesus\nd*; led_ him _away
\v 17 And bearing the cross ˱to˲_himself, ˱he˲_came_out to the \add place\add* /being/_called, “Place ˱of˲_/the/_Skull”, which /is_being/_called In_Hebrew, Golgotha,
\v 18 where ˱they˲_crucified him, and with him two others, on_this_side and on_that_side, and - \nd Jesus\nd* ˱in˲_/the/_middle.
\v 19 And - Pilate wrote also /a/_title, and put on the cross. And ˱it˲_was /having_been/_written, “\nd Jesus\nd* the Nazarene, the King ˱of˲_the Jews.”
\v 20 Therefore this - title many ˱of˲_the Jews read, because the place was near ˱of˲_the city, where - \nd Jesus\nd* /was/_crucified; and ˱it˲_was /having_been/_written In_Hebrew, In_Latin, In_Greek.
\v 21 Therefore the chief_priests ˱of˲_the Jews /were/_saying - ˱to˲_Pilate, “/Be/_=> not <=_writing, ‘The King ˱of˲_the Jews’, but that that \add one\add* said, ‘˱I˲_am King.’” ˱of˲_the Jews.’”
\v 22 - Pilate answered, “What ˱I˲_/have/_written, ˱I˲_/have/_written.”
\v 23 Therefore the soldiers when ˱they˲_crucified - \nd Jesus\nd*, took the clothes ˱of˲_him, and ˱they˲_made four parts, /a/_part ˱to˲_each soldier, and the tunic. And the tunic was seamless, from the_> top <_\add parts\add* woven through all.
\v 24 Therefore ˱they˲_said to one_another, “˱We˲_/may/_=> not <=_tear it, but ˱we˲_/may/_choose_by_lot for it, whose ˱it˲_will_be”; in_order_that the Scripture /may_be/_fulfilled - saying, “˱they˲_divided the clothes ˱of˲_me ˱to˲_themselves, and ˱they˲_cast /a/_lot for the clothing ˱of˲_me.” The therefore on_one_hand soldiers did these \add things\add*.
\v 25 On_the_other_hand the mother ˱of˲_him /had/_stood by the cross - ˱of˲_\nd Jesus\nd*, and the sister ˱of˲_the mother ˱of˲_him, Mary the \add wife\add* - ˱of˲_Clopas, and Mary the Magdalene.
\v 26 \nd Jesus\nd* therefore /having/_seen his mother, and the disciple /having/_stood_by whom ˱he˲_/was/_loving, /is/_saying ˱to˲_the mother, “Woman, behold, the son ˱of˲_you.”
\v 27 Thereafter ˱he˲_/is/_saying ˱to˲_the disciple, “Behold, the mother ˱of˲_you.” And from that - hour took the disciple her to his own.
\v 28 ¶ After this /having/_known - \nd Jesus\nd* that all \add things\add* now /has_been/_accomplished, in_order_that the Scripture /may_be/_completed, ˱he˲_/is/_saying, “˱I˲_/am/_thirsting.”
\v 29 /A/_vessel /was/_lying full ˱of˲_wine_vinegar; therefore /a/_sponge full ˱of˲_the wine_vinegar /having/_put_around ˱around˲_/a/_hyssop \add stalk\add*, ˱they˲_brought ˱over˲_it ˱to˲_his mouth.
\v 30 Therefore when - \nd Jesus\nd* took the wine_vinegar, ˱he˲_said, “˱It˲_/has_been/_finished!” And /having/_bowed the head, ˱he˲_gave_over his spirit.
\v 31 ¶ Therefore the Jews, because ˱it˲_was /the/_Preparation \add day\add*, in_order_that the bodies /may/_=> not <=_remain on the cross on the Sabbath (for ˱it˲_was great day ˱of˲_that - Sabbath), ˱they˲_asked - Pilate that the legs ˱of˲_them /may_be/_broken, and ˱they˲_/may_be/_taken_away.
\v 32 Therefore the soldiers came, and ˱they˲_broke the legs ˱of˲_the first on_one_hand, and ˱of˲_the other - /having_been/_crucified_with ˱with˲_him;
\v 33 on_the_other_hand /having/_come to - \nd Jesus\nd*, when ˱they˲_saw him /having/_died already, ˱they˲_> not <_broke the legs ˱of˲_him.
\v 34 But one ˱of˲_the soldiers pierced the side ˱of˲_him ˱with˲_/a/_spear, and immediately blood and water came_out.
\v 35 And the \add one\add* /having/_seen /has/_testified, and the testimony ˱of˲_him is true, and that \add one\add* /has/_known that ˱he˲_/is/_speaking true, in_order_that also you_all ˱you_all˲_/may_be/_believing.
\v 36 For these \add things\add* became, in_order_that the Scripture /may_be/_fulfilled, “bone ˱of˲_him /will_ not _be_being/_broken.”
\v 37 And again another Scripture /is/_saying, “˱they˲_/will_be/_looking on whom ˱they˲_pierced.”
\v 38 ¶ And after these \add things\add*, Joseph - from Arimathea being /a/_disciple - ˱of˲_\nd Jesus\nd*, but /having_been/_hidden because_of the fear ˱of˲_the Jews asked - Pilate, that ˱he˲_/may/_take_away the body - ˱of˲_\nd Jesus\nd*; and - Pilate permitted \add it\add*. Therefore came and ˱they˲_took_ him. _away.
\v 39 And Nicodemus also came, the \add one\add* /having/_come to him ˱at˲_the first ˱by˲_night, bringing /a/_wrapping ˱of˲_myrrh and aloe, about /a/_hundred pounds.
\v 40 Therefore ˱they˲_took the body - ˱of˲_\nd Jesus\nd*, and ˱they˲_bound it ˱in˲_linen_cloths with the spices, as /the/_custom ˱of˲_the Jews is /to_be/_burying.
\v 41 And ˱there˲_was /a/_garden in the place where ˱he˲_/was/_crucified, and in the garden /a/_=> new <=_tomb, in which not_yet no_one was /having_been/_laid.
\v 42 Therefore because_of the Preparation \add day\add* ˱of˲_the Jews, because near was the tomb, ˱they˲_laid - \nd Jesus\nd* there.
\c 20
\v 1 ¶ And ˱on˲_the first \add day\add* ˱of˲_the week, Mary the Magdalene /is/_coming early, to the tomb still being darkness, and /is/_seeing the stone /having_been/_taken_away from the tomb.
\v 2 Therefore ˱she˲_/is/_running and /is/_coming to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple whom /was/_loving - \nd Jesus\nd*, and ˱she˲_/is/_saying ˱to˲_them, “˱They˲_took_away the \nd Lord\nd* out_of the tomb, and ˱we˲_/have/_=> not <=_known where ˱they˲_laid him.”
\v 3 Therefore - Peter and the other disciple came_out, and ˱they˲_/were/_coming to the tomb.
\v 4 And the two /were/_running together, and the other disciple ran_ahead more_quickly \add than\add* - Peter, and came to the tomb first.
\v 5 And /having/_stooped_down, ˱he˲_/is/_seeing lying \add there\add* the linen_cloths, however ˱he˲_> not <_came_in.
\v 6 Therefore Simon Peter /is/_=> also <=_coming following ˱after˲_him, and came_in into the tomb, and /is/_observing the linen_cloths lying \add there\add*,
\v 7 and the handkerchief, which was on the head ˱of˲_him, lying \add there\add* not with the linen_cloths, but separately /having_been/_wrapped in one place.
\v 8 Therefore then the other disciple also came_in, - /having/_come first to the tomb, and ˱he˲_saw and believed;
\v 9 for ˱they˲_/had/_=> not_yet <=_known the Scripture that ˱it˲_/is/_fitting him /to/_rise_up from /the/_dead.
\v 10 Therefore the disciples ˱they˲_went_away again to themselves.
\v 11 ¶ But ¶ Mary /had/_stood at the tomb outside weeping. Therefore as ˱she˲_/was/_weeping, ˱she˲_stooped_down into the tomb,
\v 12 and /is/_observing two angels in white sitting, one at the head, and one at the feet, where the body - ˱of˲_\nd Jesus\nd* /was/_lying.
\v 13 And those /are/_saying ˱to˲_her, “Woman, why /are/_˱you˲_weeping?” ˱She˲_/is/_saying ˱to˲_them, “Because ˱they˲_took_away the \nd Lord\nd* ˱of˲_me, and ˱I˲_/have/_=> not <=_known where ˱they˲_laid him.”
\v 14 /Having/_said these \add things\add*, ˱she˲_/was/_turned back to the \add things\add*, and /is/_observing - \nd Jesus\nd* /having/_stood, and /had/_=> not <=_known that ˱it˲_is \nd Jesus\nd*.
\v 15 \nd Jesus\nd* /is/_saying ˱to˲_her, “Woman, why /are/_˱you˲_weeping? Whom /are/_˱you˲_seeking?” That \add woman\add* supposing that ˱he˲_is the gardener, /is/_saying ˱to˲_him, “Sir, if you bore him, tell ˱to˲_me where ˱you˲_laid him, and_I /will_be/_taking_ him _away.”
\v 16 - \nd Jesus\nd* /is/_saying ˱to˲_her, “Mary!” that \add woman\add* /Having_been/_turned /is/_saying ˱to˲_him In_Hebrew, “Rabboni” (that /is_being/_called, “Teacher”).
\v 17 - \nd Jesus\nd* /is/_saying ˱to˲_her, “/Be/_=> not <=_touching ˱against˲_me, for ˱I˲_/have/_=> not_yet <=_gone_up to the Father; but /be/_going to the brothers ˱of˲_me, and say ˱to˲_them, ‘˱I˲_/am/_going_up to the Father ˱of˲_me, and /the/_Father ˱of˲_you_all, and \nd God\nd* ˱of˲_me, and \nd God\nd* ˱of˲_you_all.’”
\v 18 Mary the Magdalene /Is/_coming announcing ˱to˲_the disciples, - “˱I˲_/have/_seen the \nd Lord\nd*”, and ˱he˲_said these \add things\add* ˱to˲_her.
\v 19 ¶ Therefore being evening - ˱on˲_> that <_day - first ˱of˲_/the/_week, and the doors /having_been/_shut where the disciples were because_of the fear ˱of˲_the Jews, - \nd Jesus\nd* came and stood in the midst, and /is/_saying ˱to˲_them, “Peace ˱to˲_you_all.”
\v 20 And /having/_said this, ˱he˲_showed his hands and his side ˱to˲_them. Therefore the disciples /were/_elated, /having/_seen the \nd Lord\nd*.
\v 21 Therefore - \nd Jesus\nd* ˱he˲_said ˱to˲_them again, “Peace ˱to˲_you_all; as the Father /has/_sent_ me _out, also_I /am/_sending you_all.”
\v 22 And /having/_said this, ˱he˲_breathed_on \add them\add* and /is/_saying ˱to˲_them, “Receive Holy /the/_\nd Spirit\nd*.
\v 23 If ˱of˲_any ˱you_all˲_/may/_forgive the sins, ˱they˲_/have_been/_forgiven ˱to˲_them; if ˱of˲_any ˱you_all˲_/may_be/_restraining, ˱they˲_/have_been/_restrained.”
\v 24 ¶ But Thomas, one of the twelve, the \add one\add* /being/_called Didymus, was not with them when \nd Jesus\nd* came.
\v 25 Therefore the other disciples /were/_saying ˱to˲_him, “˱We˲_/have/_seen the \nd Lord\nd*.” But he said ˱to˲_them, “If ˱I˲_/may_ not _/_see the mark ˱of˲_the nails in the hands ˱of˲_him, and ˱I˲_/may/_put the finger ˱of˲_me into the mark ˱of˲_the nails, and ˱I˲_/may/_put the hand ˱of˲_me into the side ˱of˲_him, by_no_means ˱I˲_/will_ not _be/_believing.”
\v 26 ¶ And after eight days the disciples ˱of˲_him were again inside, and Thomas with them. - \nd Jesus\nd* /Is/_coming, the doors /having_been/_shut, and stood in the midst, and said, “Peace ˱to˲_you_all.”
\v 27 Thereafter ˱he˲_/is/_saying - ˱to˲_Thomas, “/Be/_bringing the finger ˱of˲_you here, and see the hands ˱of˲_me, and /be/_bringing the hand ˱of˲_you, and put \add it\add* into the side ˱of˲_me, and /be/_=> not <=_becoming unbelieving, but believing.”
\v 28 Thomas answered and said ˱to˲_him, “The \nd Lord\nd* ˱of˲_me and the \nd God\nd* ˱of˲_me!”
\v 29 \nd Jesus\nd* /is/_saying ˱to˲_him, “Because ˱you˲_/have/_seen me, /have/_believed; blessed \add are\add* the \add ones\add* not /having/_seen, and_yet /having/_believed.”
\v 30 ¶ Many therefore on_one_hand other signs - \nd Jesus\nd* also did before ˱of˲_the disciples ˱of˲_him, which is not /having_been/_written in the this scroll.
\v 31 On_the_other_hand these \add things\add* /has_been/_written, in_order_that ˱you_all˲_/may_be/_believing that \nd Jesus\nd* is the \nd Messiah\nd*, the Son - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*, and in_order_that believing, ˱you_all˲_/may_be/_having life in the name ˱of˲_him.
\c 21
\v 1 ¶ After these \add things\add*, \nd Jesus\nd* revealed himself again ˱to˲_the disciples at the sea - ˱of˲_Tiberias; and ˱he˲_revealed \add himself\add* thus:
\v 2 Simon Peter, and Thomas - /being/_called Didymus, and Nathanael the \add one\add* from Cana - ˱of˲_Galilee, and the \add sons\add* - ˱of˲_Zebedee, and two others of the disciples ˱of˲_him. were together.
\v 3 Simon Peter /is/_saying ˱to˲_them, “˱I˲_/am/_going /to_be/_fishing.” ˱They˲_/are/_saying ˱to˲_him, “We /are/_=> also <=_coming with you.” ˱They˲_came_out and ˱they˲_boarded into the boat, and at that - night ˱they˲_caught nothing.
\v 4 ¶ But in_the_morning already becoming, \nd Jesus\nd* stood on the shore; however the disciples /had/_=> not <=_known that ˱it˲_is \nd Jesus\nd*.
\v 5 therefore \nd Jesus\nd* /is/_saying ˱to˲_them, “Little_children, ˱you_all˲_/are/_=> not <=_having any fish?” ˱They˲_answered ˱to˲_him, “No.”
\v 6 And he said ˱to˲_them, “Cast the net to the right side ˱of˲_the boat, and ˱you_all˲_/will_be/_finding \add them\add*.” Therefore ˱they˲_cast, and /was/_=> no_longer <=_able /to/_drag it because_of the multitude ˱of˲_the fishes.
\v 7 Therefore - disciple that whom - \nd Jesus\nd* /was/_loving /is/_saying - ˱to˲_Peter, “˱It˲_is the \nd Lord\nd*.” Therefore Simon Peter /having/_heard that ˱it˲_is the \nd Lord\nd*, girded his outer_garment, for ˱he˲_was naked, and cast himself into the sea.
\v 8 And the other disciples ˱in˲_the little_boat came, for ˱they˲_were not far from the land, but from about two_hundred cubits dragging the net ˱with˲_the fishes.
\v 9 ¶ Therefore when ˱they˲_got_out on the land, ˱they˲_/are/_seeing /a/_charcoal_fire lying, and fish laying_on \add it\add*, and bread.
\v 10 - \nd Jesus\nd* /is/_saying ˱to˲_them, “Bring from the fish which ˱you_all˲_caught now.”
\v 11 Therefore Simon Peter went_up, and dragged the net to - land full ˱of˲_> large <_fishes /a/_hundred fifty three; but being so_many, the net /was/_=> not <=_torn.
\v 12 - \nd Jesus\nd* /is/_saying ˱to˲_them, “Come, eat_breakfast.” But no_one ˱of˲_the disciples /was/_daring /to/_question him, who are “You?” /Having/_known that ˱it˲_is the \nd Lord\nd*.
\v 13 \nd Jesus\nd* /is/_coming, and /is/_taking the bread and /is/_giving ˱to˲_them, and the fish likewise.
\v 14 This now /the/_third \add time\add* \nd Jesus\nd* /was/_revealed ˱to˲_the disciples, /having_been/_raised from /the/_dead.
\v 15 ¶ Therefore when ˱they˲_ate_lunch, - \nd Jesus\nd* /is/_saying - ˱to˲_Simon Peter, “Simon \add son\add* ˱of˲_John, /are/_˱you˲_loving me more \add than\add* these?” ˱He˲_/is/_saying ˱to˲_him, “Yes, \nd Lord\nd*, you /have/_known that ˱I˲_/am/_loving you.” ˱He˲_/is/_saying ˱to˲_him, “/Be/_feeding the lambs ˱of˲_me.”
\v 16 ˱He˲_/is/_saying ˱to˲_him again secondly, “Simon \add son\add* ˱of˲_John, /are/_˱you˲_loving me?” ˱He˲_/is/_saying ˱to˲_him, “Yes, \nd Lord\nd*, you /have/_known that ˱I˲_/am/_loving you.” ˱He˲_/is/_saying ˱to˲_him, “/Be/_shepherding the sheep ˱of˲_me.”
\v 17 ˱He˲_/is/_saying ˱to˲_him the third \add time\add*, “Simon \add son\add* ˱of˲_John, /are/_˱you˲_loving me?” - Peter /was/_sorrowed because ˱he˲_said ˱to˲_him the third \add time\add*, “/Are/_˱you˲_loving me?” And ˱he˲_/is/_saying ˱to˲_him, “\nd Lord\nd*, you /have/_known all \add things\add*, you /are/_knowing that ˱I˲_/am/_loving you.” \nd Jesus\nd* /is/_saying ˱to˲_him, “/Be/_feeding the sheep ˱of˲_me.”
\v 18 Truly, truly, ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you, when ˱you˲_were younger, ˱you˲_/were/_girding yourself, and ˱you˲_/were/_walking where ˱you˲_/were/_wanting; but whenever ˱you˲_/may/_age, ˱you˲_/will_be/_stretching_out the hands ˱of˲_you, and others /will_be/_girding you, and /will_be/_bringing where ˱you˲_/are/_=> not <=_wanting.
\v 19 And ˱he˲_said this, signifying ˱by˲_what death ˱he˲_/will_be/_glorifying - \nd God\nd*. And /having/_said this, ˱he˲_/is/_saying ˱to˲_him, “/Be/_following ˱after˲_me.”
\v 20 ¶ /Having_been/_turned_back, - Peter /is/_seeing the disciple whom - \nd Jesus\nd* /was/_loving who also sat_down at the supper on the chest ˱of˲_him following, and said, ˱to˲_him, “\nd Lord\nd*, who is, the \add one\add* giving_ you _over?”
\v 21 Therefore /having/_seen this \add one\add*, - Peter /is/_saying - ˱to˲_\nd Jesus\nd*, “\nd Lord\nd*, and what \add about\add* this \add one\add*?”
\v 22 - \nd Jesus\nd* /is/_saying ˱to˲_him, “If ˱I˲_/may_be/_wanting him /to_be/_remaining until ˱I˲_/am/_coming, what \add is_it\add* to you? You /be/_following ˱after˲_me!”
\v 23 Therefore this - statement came_out among the brothers, that - that disciple /is/_dying_off. Not but - \nd Jesus\nd* not said ˱to˲_him that ˱He˲_/is/_=> not <=_dying_off, but \add only\add*, “If ˱I˲_/may_be/_wanting him /to_be/_remaining until ˱I˲_/am/_coming, what \add is_it\add* to you?”
\v 24 ¶ This \add one\add* is the disciple - testifying concerning these \add things\add*, and the \add one\add* /having/_written these \add things\add*, and ˱we˲_/have/_known that the testimony ˱of˲_him is true.
\v 25 And is also many other \add things\add* that - \nd Jesus\nd* did, which if in_every one /may_be_being/_written, ˱I˲_/am/_supposing not_even the world itself /going_to_be/_having_room ˱for˲_the scrolls /being/_written.
