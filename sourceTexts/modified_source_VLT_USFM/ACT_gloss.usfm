\v 1 ¶ Indeed the first account ˱I˲_made concerning all \add things\add*, O Theophilus, ˱of˲_which \nd Jesus\nd* began both /to_be/_doing and /to_be/_teaching,
\v 2 until which day /having/_commanded by /the/_=> Holy <=_\nd Spirit\nd* ˱to˲_the ambassadors, whom ˱he˲_chose, ˱he˲_/was/_taken_up;
\v 3 ˱to˲_whom also after the \add time\add* him /to/_suffer ˱he˲_presented himself living, with many proofs through forty days, appearing ˱to˲_them, and speaking the \add things\add* concerning the Kingdom - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*.
\v 4 And assembling_together, ˱he˲_commanded ˱to˲_them, “From Jerusalem not /to_be_being/_departed, but /to_be/_awaiting the promise ˱of˲_the Father, which ˱you_all˲_heard ˱from˲_me.
\v 5 Because John on_one_hand baptized ˱with˲_water, on_the_other_hand you_all /will_be_being/_baptized with /the/_=> Holy <=_\nd Spirit\nd*, after many not these days.”
\v 6 ¶ Therefore indeed the \add ones\add* /having/_come_together, /were/_asking him saying, “\nd Lord\nd*, - at - this time, /are/_˱you˲_restoring the kingdom - ˱to˲_Israel?”
\v 7 And ˱he˲_said to them, “˱It˲_is not ˱of˲_you_all /to/_know times or seasons, which the Father set by his own authority.
\v 8 But ˱you_all˲_/will_be/_receiving power, /having/_=> The Holy \nd Spirit\nd* <=_come_over on you_all, and ˱you_all˲_will_be witnesses ˱for˲_me, in both Jerusalem, and in all - Judea, and Samaria, and to /the/_last \add part\add* ˱of˲_the earth.”
\v 9 And /having/_said these \add things\add*, seeing them, ˱he˲_/was/_lifted_up and /a/_cloud took_ him _up from the eyes ˱of˲_them.
\v 10 And as ˱they˲_were looking_intently into the sky, him going, also behold two men in white clothing, /had/_stood_by ˱to˲_them,
\v 11 who also said, “Men, Galileans, why ˱you_all˲_/have/_stood looking at the sky? This - \nd Jesus\nd* - /having_been/_taken_up from you_all into - heaven, thus /will_be/_coming which manner ˱you_all˲_saw him going into - heaven.”
\v 12 ¶ Then ˱they˲_returned to Jerusalem from /the/_mountain - /being/_called ˱of˲_Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, having journey ˱of˲_/a/_Sabbath.
\v 13 And when ˱they˲_came_in, into the upper_room, ˱they˲_went_up where ˱they˲_were staying, - jointly Peter and John and Jacobus and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, Jacobus ˱of˲_Alpheus, and Simon the Zealot, and Judas ˱of˲_Jacobus.
\v 14 These all were persevering - ˱in˲_prayer with_one_accord, with /the/_women and Mary the mother - ˱of˲_\nd Jesus\nd*, and the brothers ˱of˲_him.
\v 15 ¶ And in - these days, Peter /having/_stood_up in /the/_midst ˱of˲_the brothers said (and /the/_crowd ˱of˲_names with the same was about /a/_hundred twenty),
\v 16 “Men, brothers, ˱it˲_/was/_fitting the Scripture /to_be/_fulfilled, which the - Holy \nd Spirit\nd* previously_said by /the/_mouth ˱of˲_David concerning Judas, the \add one\add* /having/_become guide ˱to˲_the \add ones\add* /having/_captured \nd Jesus\nd*.
\v 17 Because ˱he˲_was /having_been/_numbered with us, and obtained - /a/_lot - ˱of˲_> this <_service.”
\v 18 (Therefore indeed this \add man\add* acquired /a/_field out_of /the/_reward - ˱of˲_unrighteousness, and /having/_become headlong, ˱he˲_burst_open ˱in˲_/the/_middle, and all the intestines ˱of˲_him /was/_poured_out.
\v 19 And ˱it˲_became known ˱to˲_all the \add ones\add* dwelling_in Jerusalem, so_that that - field /to_be/_called ˱in˲_their language ˱of˲_them, Akeldamach, this is, “Field ˱of˲_Blood”.)
\v 20 “For ˱it˲_/has_been/_written in scroll ˱of˲_Psalms, the /the/_homestead ˱of˲_him ‘/let_be/_become desolate, and let_ not _be the \add one\add* dwelling in it’, and, ‘/let/_=> another <=_take the overseeing ˱of˲_him.’
\v 21 Therefore ˱it˲_/is/_fitting ˱of˲_the men /having/_come_together ˱with˲_us, at all /the/_time that the \nd Lord\nd* \nd Jesus\nd* came_in and came_out with us,
\v 22 /having/_begun from the baptism ˱of˲_John until the day ˱in˲_which ˱he˲_/was/_taken_up from us, /a/_witness ˱of˲_the resurrection ˱of˲_him with us, /to/_become one ˱of˲_these.”
\v 23 And ˱they˲_set two, Joseph - /being/_called Barsabbas, who /was/_called Justus, and Matthias.
\v 24 And /having/_prayed, ˱they˲_said, “You \nd Lord\nd*, heart_knower ˱of˲_all, reveal which one ˱you˲_chose of these - two,
\v 25 /to/_take the this place - ˱of˲_service and commission, from which Judas broke_from, /to_be/_gone to his - own place.”
\v 26 And ˱they˲_gave lots ˱to˲_them, and the lot fell on Matthias, and ˱he˲_/was/_chosen_together_with with the eleven ambassadors.
\c 2
\v 1 ¶ And at the \add time\add* the day - ˱of˲_Pentecost /to_be_being/_fulfilled, ˱they˲_were all together in the same \add place\add*.
\v 2 And suddenly /a/_sound became out_of - heaven, as /being/_carried ˱of˲_/a/_=> forceful <=_wind, and ˱it˲_filled all the house where ˱they˲_were sitting.
\v 3 And dividing tongues as_if ˱of˲_fire /were/_seen ˱to˲_them, and sat_down on each one ˱of˲_them.
\v 4 And ˱they˲_/were/_=> all <=_filled ˱with˲_/the/_=> Holy <=_\nd Spirit\nd*, and ˱they˲_began /to_be/_speaking ˱with˲_other tongues, as the \nd Spirit\nd* /was/_giving ˱to˲_them /to_be/_speaking_out.
\v 5 ¶ And Jews were dwelling in Jerusalem, devout men from every nation ˱of˲_the \add nations\add* under - heaven.
\v 6 And - ˱of˲_> this <_sound /having/_become, the multitude came_together and /was/_confounded, because each one heard speaking ˱of˲_them ˱in˲_his. own language.
\v 7 And ˱they˲_/were/_amazed and ˱they˲_/were/_marveling saying, “Behold are not, all these who \add are\add* speaking Galileans?
\v 8 And how /are/_=> we <=_hearing each ˱in˲_the own language ˱of˲_us, in which ˱we˲_/were/_born?
\v 9 Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the \add ones\add* dwelling_in - Mesopotamia, Judea and jointly Cappadocia, Pontus and - Asia,
\v 10 Phrygia and jointly Pamphylia, Egypt, and the parts - ˱of˲_Libya - along Cyrene, and the \add ones\add* Romans visiting,
\v 11 both Jews and converts, Cretans and Arabs– ˱we˲_/are/_hearing them speaking, the great \add things\add* - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd* - ˱in˲_our tongues.”
\v 12 And all /were/_marveling and /were/_thoroughly_perplexed, another saying to another, “What /is/_wanting this to_be?”
\v 13 But others mocking /were/_saying, - “˱They˲_are /having_been/_filled ˱of˲_sweet_wine.”
\v 14 ¶ But - Peter /having_been/_stood with the eleven, lifted_up the voice ˱of˲_him and spoke_out ˱to˲_them: “Men, Judeans, and all you_all dwelling_in Jerusalem, let_ this _be known ˱to˲_you_all and give_ear ˱to˲_the words ˱of˲_me.
\v 15 For these /are/_=> not <=_being_drunk as you_all /are/_supposing, for ˱it˲_is /the/_=> third <=_hour, ˱of˲_the day,
\v 16 but this is the \add word\add* /having_been/_spoken by the prophet Joel:
\v 17 ‘and ˱it˲_will_be with these \add things\add* in the last days’, - \nd God\nd* /is/_saying, ‘˱I˲_/will_be/_pouring_out of the \nd Spirit\nd* ˱of˲_me on all flesh, and the sons ˱of˲_you_all /will_be/_prophesying, and the daughters ˱of˲_you_all, and the young_men ˱of˲_you_all /will_be/_seeing visions, and the elders ˱of˲_you_all ˱in˲_dreams /will_be_being/_dreamt;
\v 18 and surely ˱I˲_/will_be/_pouring_out of the \nd Spirit\nd* ˱of˲_me on the slaves ˱of˲_me, and on the handmaidens ˱of˲_me, in - those days, and ˱they˲_/will_be/_prophesying.
\v 19 And ˱I˲_/will_be/_giving wonders in the sky above, and signs on the earth below, blood, and fire, and vapor ˱of˲_smoke.
\v 20 The sun /will_be_being/_altered into darkness and the moon into blood, before /the/_=> - great and glorious <=_day ˱of˲_/the/_\nd Lord\nd* /to/_come.
\v 21 And ˱it˲_will_be, everyone who - /may/_call ˱on˲_the name ˱of˲_/the/_\nd Lord\nd* /will_be_being/_saved.’
\v 22 ¶ Men, Israelites, hear - words these: \nd Jesus\nd* the Nazarene, /a/_man /having_been/_demonstrated by - \nd God\nd* to you_all ˱by˲_miracles, and wonders, and signs, which - \nd God\nd* did by him in /the/_midst ˱of˲_you_all, as ˱you_all˲_> yourselves <_/have/_known.
\v 23 This \add man\add* ˱by˲_the, /having_been/_designated counsel and foreknowledge - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*, delivered_up by /the/_hand ˱of˲_/the/_lawless \add ones\add*, ˱you_all˲_killed /having/_crucified.
\v 24 Whom - \nd God\nd* raised_up, /having/_loosed the agonies ˱of˲_the death, as_much_as was not possible him /to_be_being/_restrained by it.
\v 25 For David /is/_saying to him, ‘˱I˲_/was/_foreseeing the \nd Lord\nd* before me through all \add time\add*, because ˱he˲_is on /the/_right \add hand\add* ˱of˲_me, in_order_that ˱I˲_/may_ not _be/_shaken.
\v 26 Because_of this the heart ˱of˲_me /was/_gladdened, and the tongue ˱of˲_me exulted, and still also the flesh ˱of˲_me /will_be/_nesting in hope;
\v 27 because ˱you˲_/will_ not _be/_abandoning the soul ˱of˲_me into Hades, nor /will_˱you˲_/be_giving the Devout \add One\add* ˱of˲_you /to/_see decay.
\v 28 ˱You˲_made_known ˱to˲_me /the/_ways ˱of˲_life, ˱you˲_/will_be/_filling me ˱with˲_gladness with the presence ˱of˲_you.’
\v 29 ¶ Men, brothers, ˱it˲_/is/_permitting /to/_speak with confidence to you_all concerning the patriarch David that ˱he˲_> both <_died and /was/_buried, and the tomb ˱of˲_him is among us until - this day.
\v 30 Therefore being /a/_prophet, and /having/_known that ‘- \nd God\nd* swore ˱to˲_him ˱with˲_/an/_oath’, ‘of /the/_fruit ˱of˲_the loin ˱of˲_him, /to/_sit_down on the throne ˱of˲_him’.
\v 31 /Having/_foreseen, ˱he˲_spoke concerning the resurrection ˱of˲_the \nd Messiah\nd* that ‘neither /was/_abandoned into Hades’, nor the flesh ˱of˲_him ‘saw decay’.
\v 32 This - \nd Jesus\nd* - \nd God\nd* raised_up, ˱of˲_which all we are witnesses.
\v 33 Therefore /having_been/_exalted ˱by˲_the right \add hand\add* - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*, and /having/_received the promise ˱of˲_the - Holy \nd Spirit\nd*, from the Father, ˱he˲_poured_ this _out which you_all /are/_seeing and /are/_hearing.
\v 34 For David not went_up into the heavens, but himself /is/_saying, /the/_\nd Lord\nd* ‘said ˱to˲_the \nd Lord\nd* ˱of˲_me, “/Be/_sitting on /the/_right \add hand\add* ˱of˲_me,
\v 35 until - ˱I˲_/may/_put the enemies ˱of˲_you /a/_footstool ˱of˲_the feet ˱of˲_you.”’
\v 36 Assuredly therefore /let_ All /the/_house ˱of˲_Israel _be/_knowing that - \nd God\nd* made him both /the/_\nd Lord\nd* and /the/_\nd Messiah\nd*, this - \nd Jesus\nd* whom you_all crucified.”
\v 37 ¶ And /having/_heard, ˱they˲_/were/_pierced ˱to˲_the heart, and ˱they˲_said to - Peter and the other ambassadors, “What /may/_˱we˲_do, men, brothers?”
\v 38 And Peter /is/_saying to them, “Repent”, “and /let_ each ˱of˲_you_all _be/_baptized in the name ˱of˲_\nd Jesus\nd* \nd Christ\nd*, for forgiveness ˱of˲_the sins ˱of˲_you_all, and ˱you_all˲_/will_be/_receiving the gift ˱of˲_the Holy \nd Spirit\nd*.
\v 39 For the promise is ˱to˲_you_all, and ˱to˲_the children ˱of˲_you_all, and ˱to˲_all the \add ones\add* at far, as_many_as - /may/_call_to /the/_\nd Lord\nd*, the \nd God\nd* ˱of˲_us.”
\v 40 Both ˱with˲_> more <_other words ˱he˲_testified, and /was/_exhorting them saying, “/Be/_saved from this - crooked - generation.”
\v 41 Therefore indeed the \add ones\add* /having/_welcomed the word ˱of˲_him /were/_baptized, and /were/_added on - that day, about three_thousand souls.
\v 42 And ˱they˲_were persevering ˱in˲_the teaching ˱of˲_the ambassadors, and - ˱in˲_fellowship, the breaking ˱of˲_the bread, and - ˱in˲_prayers.
\v 43 ¶ And ¶ reverence /was/_becoming ˱on˲_every soul, and many wonders and signs /was/_becoming through the ambassadors. in Jerusalem. and great fear was with all.
\v 44 and And all the \add ones\add* /having/_believed were with the same \add purpose\add*, and ˱they˲_/were/_having all common \add things\add*,
\v 45 and ˱they˲_/were/_selling their properties and their possessions, and ˱they˲_/were/_dividing them ˱to˲_all, anyone /was/_having as_much_as would need.
\v 46 And in_every day persevering with_one_accord in the temple, and breaking bread in_every house, ˱they˲_/were/_partaking ˱of˲_food with exultation and simplicity ˱of˲_heart,
\v 47 praising - \nd God\nd* and having favor with all the people. And the \nd Lord\nd* /was/_adding the \add ones\add* /being/_saved with the same. in_every day.
\c 3
\v 1 ¶ And Peter also John /were/_going_up into the temple at the hour - ˱of˲_prayer the ninth \add hour\add*.
\v 2 And /a/_certain man, being lame from /the/_womb ˱of˲_/the/_mother ˱of˲_him, /was_being/_born, whom ˱they˲_/were/_putting in_every day at the door ˱of˲_the temple, - /being/_called Beautiful, - /to_be/_requesting alms from the \add ones\add* entering_in into the temple.
\v 3 Who /having/_seen Peter and John going /to_be/_entering into the temple, /was/_asking /to/_receive alms.
\v 4 But Peter /having/_looked_intently at him with - John said, “Look to us.”
\v 5 And he /was/_holding_on ˱to˲_them, expecting /to/_receive something from them.
\v 6 But Peter said, “Silver and gold /is/_=> not <=_being ˱to˲_me, but this what ˱I˲_/am/_having, ˱I˲_/am/_giving ˱to˲_you– in the name ˱of˲_\nd Jesus\nd* \nd Christ\nd* ˱of˲_the Nazarene, /be/_walking!”
\v 7 And /having/_grabbed him ˱by˲_the right hand, ˱he˲_raised him; and immediately the feet ˱of˲_him and the ankles /were/_strengthened.
\v 8 And leaping_up, ˱he˲_stood and /was/_walking, and came_in with them into the temple, walking, and springing_up, and praising - \nd God\nd*.
\v 9 And all the people saw him walking and praising the \nd God\nd*.
\v 10 And ˱they˲_/were/_recognizing him that he was the \add one\add* sitting at the Beautiful Gate ˱of˲_the temple for the alms, and ˱they˲_/were/_filled ˱with˲_amazement and amazement at the \add thing\add* /having_been/_happened ˱to˲_him.
\v 11 And ˱of˲_him taking_hold_of - Peter and - John, all the people ran_together to them in the portico - /being/_called ˱of˲_Solomon, greatly_amazed.
\v 12 But - Peter /having/_seen \add it\add*, answered to the people, “Men, Israelites, why ˱you_all˲_/are/_wondering at this, or why ˱you_all˲_/are/_looking_intently ˱at˲_us, as_though ˱by˲_/our/_own power or devoutness /having/_made him - /to_be/_walking?
\v 13 The \nd God\nd* ˱of˲_Abraham, and the /the/_\nd God\nd* ˱of˲_Isaac, and the /the/_\nd God\nd* ˱of˲_Jacob, the \nd God\nd* ˱of˲_the fathers ˱of˲_us, glorified the servant ˱of˲_him, \nd Jesus\nd*, whom you_all indeed gave_over, and disowned in /the/_presence ˱of˲_Pilate, that \add one\add* /having/_judged /to_be/_sending_away \add him\add*.
\v 14 But you_all disowned the Holy \add One\add* and Righteous \add One\add*, and ˱you_all˲_requested /a/_man /a/_murderer /to_be/_granted ˱to˲_you_all,
\v 15 but ˱you_all˲_killed_off the Originator - ˱of˲_life, whom - \nd God\nd* raised from /the/_dead, ˱of˲_which we are witnesses.
\v 16 And - faith ˱in˲_the name ˱of˲_him, this \add man\add* whom ˱you_all˲_/are/_observing and ˱you_all˲_/have/_known, strengthened the name ˱of˲_him, and the faith which \add is\add* by him, gave - complete_healing ˱to˲_him this in_front_of all ˱of˲_you_all.
\v 17 ¶ And now, brothers, ˱I˲_/have/_known that ˱you_all˲_did in ignorance, as also the rulers ˱of˲_you_all.
\v 18 But what \add things\add* - \nd God\nd* foretold by /the/_mouth ˱of˲_all the prophets, the \nd Messiah\nd* ˱of˲_him /to/_suffer, ˱he˲_fulfilled thus.
\v 19 Therefore repent and turn_back, for the \add time\add* ˱of˲_you_all - sins /to_be/_wiped_out,
\v 20 so_that - times ˱of˲_refreshment /may/_come from /the/_presence ˱of˲_the \nd Lord\nd*, and ˱he˲_/may/_send_out the \add one\add* /having_been/_appointed ˱to˲_you_all /the/_\nd Messiah\nd* \nd Jesus\nd*,
\v 21 whom indeed ˱it˲_/is/_fitting heaven /to/_receive, until /the/_times ˱of˲_restoration ˱of˲_all \add things\add*, which - \nd God\nd* spoke from /the/_age by /the/_mouth ˱of˲_the holy prophets ˱of˲_him.
\v 22 Indeed Moses said, - /the/_\nd Lord\nd*, the \nd God\nd* ˱of˲_us /will_be/_raising_up ‘“/a/_prophet ˱to˲_you_all like ˱of˲_you_all me from the brothers, ˱you_all˲_/will_be/_hearing ˱from˲_him” in all \add things\add*, as_many_as - ˱he˲_/may/_speak to you_all.
\v 23 “And ˱it˲_will_be \add that\add* every soul, whoever - /may/_=> not <=_hear - ˱from˲_> that <_prophet, /will_be_being/_wholly_destroyed from the people.”’
\v 24 And also all the prophets from Samuel and the \add ones\add* consecutively, as_many_as spoke, also proclaimed - these days.
\v 25 You_all are the sons ˱of˲_the prophets, and ˱of˲_the covenant which - \nd God\nd* covenanted with the fathers ˱of˲_you_all, saying to Abraham, ‘and in the seed ˱of˲_you all the families ˱of˲_the earth /will_be_being/_blessed.’
\v 26 - \nd God\nd* /having/_raised_up the servant ˱of˲_him, sent_ him _out ˱To˲_you_all first, blessing you_all in that /to_be/_turning_away each from the wickedness ˱of˲_you_all.”
\c 4
\v 1 ¶ And ˱of˲_them speaking to the people, the chief_priests, and the officer ˱of˲_the temple, and the Sadducees approached ˱to˲_them,
\v 2 being_thoroughly_disturbing because_of the \add thing\add* them /to_be/_teaching ˱to˲_the people, and /to_be/_proclaiming the resurrection in - \nd Jesus\nd*, which \add is\add* from /the/_dead.
\v 3 And ˱they˲_laid_ their _on ˱on˲_them hands, and ˱they˲_put \add them\add* in jail to the_> next <_\add day\add*, for ˱it˲_was already evening.
\v 4 But many the \add ones\add* /having/_heard the word, believed and number ˱of˲_the men /was/_become about five thousands.
\v 5 ¶ And ˱it˲_became on the_> next <_\add day\add* the rulers ˱of˲_them, and the elders, and the scribes /to_be/_gathered_together in Jerusalem,
\v 6 and Annas the chief_priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as_many_as were of chief_priestly descent.
\v 7 And /having/_stood them in the midst, ˱they˲_/were/_inquiring, “In what power or in what name you_all did this?”
\v 8 Then Peter /having_been/_filled ˱with˲_/the/_=> Holy <=_\nd Spirit\nd*, said to them, “Rulers ˱of˲_the people and elders,
\v 9 if we today /are_being/_examined on /a/_good_work ˱to˲_/the/_=> sick <=_man, by what this \add one\add* /has_been/_healed,
\v 10 ˱it˲_let_be known ˱to˲_all you_all and ˱to˲_all the people ˱of˲_Israel, that in the name ˱of˲_\nd Jesus\nd* \nd Christ\nd* the Nazarene, whom you_all crucified, whom - \nd God\nd* raised from /the/_dead, by this \add name\add* this \add man\add* /has/_stood_by before you_all healthy.
\v 11 This \add one\add* is ‘the stone - /having_been/_scorned by you_all, the builders, which /having/_become to /the/_head ˱of˲_/the/_corner’.
\v 12 And not_one the is not in other salvation, for ˱there˲_is not another name under - heaven - /having_been/_given among people, by which ˱it˲_/is/_fitting us /to_be/_saved.”
\v 13 ¶ And observing the boldness - ˱of˲_Peter and ˱of˲_John, and /having/_grasped that ˱they˲_are illiterate and ordinary men, ˱they˲_/were/_marveling, and ˱they˲_/were/_recognizing them that ˱they˲_were with - \nd Jesus\nd*.
\v 14 And seeing the man /having/_stood with them, the \add one\add* /having_been/_healed, ˱they˲_/were/_having nothing /to/_speak_against \add them\add*.
\v 15 But /having/_commanded them /to/_go_away outside the Sanhedrin, ˱they˲_/were/_conferring with one_another
\v 16 saying, “What ˱we˲_/may/_do - ˱to˲_> these <_men? For indeed that /has/_become /a/_known sign through them, ˱to˲_all the \add ones\add* dwelling_in Jerusalem \add is\add* manifest, and ˱we˲_/are/_=> not <=_being_able /to_be/_disowning \add it\add*.
\v 17 But in_order_that /may_ not _be/_spread on more among the people, ˱we˲_/may/_threaten ˱to˲_them /to_ no_longer _be/_speaking in - this name ˱to˲_no_one ˱of˲_/the/_people.”
\v 18 And /having/_called them, ˱they˲_commanded \add them\add* not /to_be/_speaking nor /to_be/_teaching in the name - ˱of˲_\nd Jesus\nd* at_all.
\v 19 But - Peter and John answering said to them, “Judge whether ˱it˲_is right before - \nd God\nd*, /to_be/_hearing ˱from˲_you_all rather than - ˱from˲_\nd God\nd*.
\v 20 For we /are/_=> not <=_being_able /to_be/_=> not <=_speaking what ˱we˲_saw and ˱we˲_heard.”
\v 21 And they /having/_further_threatened \add them\add* sent_ them _away, finding nothing - how ˱they˲_/may/_punish them, because_of the people, because all /were/_glorifying - \nd God\nd* for the \add thing\add* /having/_become.
\v 22 For the man on whom this - sign ˱of˲_the healing /had/_become was more years \add than\add* forty.
\v 23 ¶ And /having_been/_sent_away, ˱they˲_came to their own, and ˱they˲_reported as_much_as the chief_priests and the elders said to them.
\v 24 And which /having/_heard, with_one_accord lifted_up /their/_voice to - \nd God\nd* and said, “Master, you - ‘/having/_made the heaven, and the earth, and the sea, and all the \add things\add* in them’,
\v 25 the \add one\add* ˱of˲_the father ˱of˲_us, by /the/_=> Holy <=_\nd Spirit\nd* ˱of˲_/the/_mouth David servant ˱of˲_you /having/_said, ‘for_ why _reason /the/_pagans raged, and peoples pondered new \add things\add*?
\v 26 Standing_before the kings ˱of˲_the earth and the rulers /were/_gathered_together with - themselves against the \nd Lord\nd*, and against the \nd Messiah\nd* ˱of˲_him.’
\v 27 For both Herod and Pontius Pilate /were/_gathered_together in truth in - this city with /the/_pagans and peoples ˱of˲_Israel against the holy servant ˱of˲_you \nd Jesus\nd*, whom ˱you˲_anointed,
\v 28 /to/_do as_much_as the hand ˱of˲_you, and the counsel ˱of˲_you predetermined /to/_become.
\v 29 And the \add things\add* now, \nd Lord\nd*, look_upon on the threats ˱of˲_them, and give ˱to˲_the slaves ˱of˲_you, all /to_be/_speaking the ˱of˲_you word with boldness,
\v 30 in that the hand /to_be/_stretching_out ˱to˲_you for healing, and signs, and wonders, /to_be/_becoming through the name ˱of˲_the holy servant ˱of˲_you, \nd Jesus\nd*.”
\v 31 And /having_been/_besought ˱of˲_them, the place in which ˱they˲_were /having_been/_gathered_together /was/_shaken, and all /were/_filled the Holy \nd Spirit\nd*, and ˱they˲_/were/_speaking the word - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd* with boldness.
\v 32 ¶ And the multitude ˱of˲_the \add ones\add* /having/_believed, was one ˱in˲_heart and soul, and not_even one anything ˱of˲_the \add things\add* possessing ˱to˲_him /was/_saying to_be /his/_own, but was all \add things\add* ˱in˲_common ˱to˲_them.
\v 33 And ˱with˲_> great <_power, the ambassadors ˱of˲_the \nd Lord\nd* \nd Jesus\nd* /were/_giving_back -, testimony, ˱of˲_the resurrection, and great grace was on them all.
\v 34 For not_even any impoverished was among them; for as_many_as /were/_being owners ˱of˲_properties or houses, selling \add them\add* ˱they˲_/were/_bringing the values ˱of˲_the \add things\add* /being/_sold,
\v 35 and ˱they˲_/were/_laying \add them\add* before the feet ˱of˲_the ambassadors; and ˱it˲_/was_being/_distributed ˱to˲_each, as_much_as - anyone /was/_having need.
\v 36 And Joseph the \add one\add* /having_been/_called Barnabas, by the ambassadors, which is /being/_translated, “son ˱of˲_exhortation”, /a/_Levite, /a/_Cyprian - ˱by˲_descent,
\v 37 possessing ˱by˲_him ˱of˲_/a/_field, /having/_sold \add it\add* brought the money and laid \add it\add* before the feet ˱of˲_the ambassadors.
\c 5
\v 1 ¶ But /a/_certain man ˱by˲_/the/_name Ananias, with Sapphira the wife ˱of˲_him, sold /a/_property
\v 2 and embezzled from the value, the wife also /having/_become_aware, and /having/_brought /a/_certain portion, ˱he˲_laid \add it\add* before the feet ˱of˲_the ambassadors.
\v 3 But - Peter said, “Ananias, for_ Why _reason - Satan filled the heart ˱of˲_you, ˱for˲_you /to/_lie ˱to˲_the - Holy \nd Spirit\nd*, and /to/_embezzle from the value ˱of˲_the property?
\v 4 Not remaining \add unsold\add* ˱it˲_/was/_remaining ˱to˲_you, and /having_been/_sold ˱it˲_/was/_being in - your authority? Why that ˱you˲_purposed in the heart ˱of˲_you - this matter? ˱You˲_lied not ˱to˲_people, but - ˱to˲_\nd God\nd*.”
\v 5 And - Ananias hearing - these words, /having/_fallen ˱he˲_stopped_breathing. And great fear became on all the \add ones\add* hearing.
\v 6 And /having/_risen_up, the younger \add men\add* covered him, and /having/_brought_out \add him\add*, ˱they˲_buried \add him\add*.
\v 7 ¶ And ˱it˲_became /a/_period about three hours, and the wife ˱of˲_him, not /having/_known the \add thing\add* /having/_become, came_in.
\v 8 And Peter answered to her, “Tell ˱to˲_me if ˱for˲_so_much the property and?” ˱you_all˲_gave_back she said, “Yes, ˱for˲_so_much.”
\v 9 But - Peter \add said\add* to her, “Why \add is_it\add* that ˱it˲_/was/_agreed_together ˱by˲_you_all /to/_test the \nd Spirit\nd* ˱of˲_/the/_\nd Lord\nd*? Behold, the feet ˱of˲_the \add ones\add* /having/_buried the husband ˱of˲_you \add are\add* at the door, and ˱they˲_/will_be/_bringing_ you _out.”
\v 10 And immediately ˱she˲_fell before the feet ˱of˲_him, and stopped_breathing. And /having/_come_in, the young_men found her dead, and /having/_brought_out \add her\add*, ˱they˲_buried \add her\add* with the husband ˱of˲_her.
\v 11 And great reverence became on all the assembly, and on all the \add ones\add* hearing these \add things\add*.
\v 12 And by the hands ˱of˲_the ambassadors, many signs and wonders /was/_becoming; among the people; and all were with_one_accord in the Portico ˱of˲_Solomon.
\v 13 But ˱of˲_the rest no_one /was/_daring /to_be_being/_joined_together ˱to˲_them, but the people /was/_magnifying them,
\v 14 and more believing \add ones\add* /were_being/_added ˱in˲_the \nd Lord\nd*, multitudes ˱of˲_> both <_men and women;
\v 15 so_as even /to_be/_bringing_out the sick on the roads, and /to_be/_putting \add them\add* on cots and pallets, in_order_that coming ˱of˲_Peter, even_if the shadow /may/_overshadow ˱on˲_someone ˱of˲_them.
\v 16 And the multitude /was/_coming_together also ˱from˲_the surrounding /the/_cities ˱of˲_Jerusalem, bringing /the/_sick and /being/_being_tormented \add ones\add* by unclean spirits, who /were_ all _being/_healed.
\v 17 ¶ But the chief_priest and all the \add ones\add* with him, being the sect ˱of˲_the Sadducees /having/_risen_up, /were/_filled ˱with˲_jealousy,
\v 18 and ˱they˲_laid_on their hands on the ambassadors, and ˱they˲_put them in public jail.
\v 19 But /an/_angel ˱of˲_/the/_\nd Lord\nd* opened_up the doors ˱of˲_the prison through, /the/_night, and /having/_led_ them _out said,
\v 20 “/Be/_going, and /having_been/_stood, in the temple /be/_speaking ˱to˲_the people all the words - ˱of˲_> this <_life.”
\v 21 And /having/_heard, ˱they˲_came_in by - dawn into the temple, and ˱they˲_/were/_teaching. ¶ And ¶ /having/_arrived the chief_priest and the \add ones\add* with him, ˱they˲_called_together the Sanhedrin and all the Sanhedrin ˱of˲_the sons ˱of˲_Israel, and ˱they˲_sent_out to the prison ˱for˲_them /to_be/_brought.
\v 22 But they /having/_arrived attendants, not found them in the prison, and /having/_returned, ˱they˲_reported
\v 23 saying, - “˱We˲_found the /the/_prison /having_been/_shut with all security, and the guards /having/_stood before the doors, but /having/_opened_up, ˱we˲_found no_one inside.”
\v 24 And when ˱they˲_heard - these words, both the officer ˱of˲_the temple and the chief_priests /were/_thoroughly_perplexing concerning them, what - this /might/_become.
\v 25 But /having/_arrived, someone reported ˱to˲_them, - “Behold, the men whom ˱you_all˲_put in the prison are in the temple, /having/_stood and teaching the people!”
\v 26 Then /having/_gone_away, the officer with the attendants /was/_bringing them, not with force, for ˱they˲_/were/_fearing the people, lest ˱they˲_/may_be/_stoned.
\v 27 ¶ And /having/_brought them, ˱they˲_set \add them\add* in the Sanhedrin. And the chief_priest asked them
\v 28 saying, ˱we˲_commanded ˱to˲_you_all “˱By˲_/a/_charge not /to_be/_teaching in - this name, and behold, ˱you_all˲_/have/_filled - Jerusalem ˱with˲_the teaching ˱of˲_you_all, and ˱you_all˲_/are/_wishing /to/_bring_upon on us the blood - ˱of˲_> this <_man.”
\v 29 But Peter and the ambassadors answering said, “/To_be/_yielding ˱it˲_/is/_fitting ˱to˲_\nd God\nd*, rather than people.
\v 30 The \nd God\nd* ˱of˲_the fathers ˱of˲_us raised \nd Jesus\nd*, whom you_all handed_over, /having/_hanged \add him\add* on /a/_cross.
\v 31 - \nd God\nd* exalted This \add one\add* Originator and Savior, ˱by˲_the right \add hand\add* ˱of˲_him, - /to/_give repentance - ˱to˲_Israel and forgiveness ˱of˲_sins.
\v 32 And we are witnesses - ˱of˲_> these <_words, and the - Holy \nd Spirit\nd*, whom - \nd God\nd* gave ˱to˲_the \add ones\add* yielding ˱to˲_him.”
\v 33 ¶ And they /having/_heard /were_being/_cut_through, and ˱they˲_/were/_wishing /to/_kill them.
\v 34 But /a/_certain Pharisee ˱by˲_/the/_name Gamaliel /having/_risen_up in the Sanhedrin, /a/_law_teacher honored ˱by˲_all the people, ˱he˲_commanded \add them\add* /to/_make the men. outside /a/_little \add time\add*.
\v 35 And ˱he˲_said to them, “Men, Israelites, /be/_taking_heed ˱to˲_yourselves what ˱you_all˲_/are/_going /to_be/_doing with - these men.
\v 36 For before these - days Theudas rose_up, saying himself to_be someone, ˱to˲_whom /was/_joined_up ˱of˲_men /a/_number ˱of˲_> about <_four_hundred; who /was/_killed and all as_many_as /were_being/_persuaded ˱by˲_him /were/_dispersed and became to nothing.
\v 37 After this, Judas the Galilean rose_up in the days ˱of˲_the registration, and drew_away people after him; and_that \add one\add* perished, and all as_many_as /were_being/_persuaded ˱by˲_him /were/_scattered.
\v 38 And now ˱I˲_/am/_saying the \add things\add* ˱to˲_you_all, withdraw from - these men and allow them, because if this - counsel or this - work ˱it˲_may_be from humans, /will_be_being/_torn_down,
\v 39 but if ˱it˲_is from \nd God\nd*, ˱you_all˲_/will_ not _be/_able /to/_tear_down them, lest also ˱you_all˲_/may_be/_found God-opposers.” And ˱they˲_/were/_persuaded ˱by˲_him,
\v 40 and /having/_called_to the ambassadors, /having/_beat ˱they˲_commanded \add them\add* not /to_be/_speaking in the name - ˱of˲_\nd Jesus\nd*, and ˱they˲_sent_away \add them\add*.
\v 41 Therefore they indeed /were/_going, rejoicing from /the/_presence ˱of˲_the Sanhedrin that ˱they˲_/were/_considered_worthy /to_be/_dishonored for his name.
\v 42 And every day in the temple and in /each/_house, ˱they˲_/were/_=> not <=_ceasing teaching and gospel_preaching the \nd Messiah\nd*, \nd Jesus\nd*.
\c 6
\v 1 ¶ And in - these days multiplying the disciples, became /a/_grumbling ˱of˲_the Hellenists against the Hebrews, because the widows ˱of˲_them /were_being/_overlooked in the - daily service.
\v 2 And the twelve /having/_called_to the multitude ˱of˲_the disciples said, “˱It˲_is not pleasing us, /having/_left the word - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*, /to_be/_serving ˱unto˲_tables.
\v 3 but brothers examine, men from ˱of˲_you_all /being/_attested, seven full ˱of˲_/the/_\nd Spirit\nd* and wisdom, whom ˱we˲_/will_be/_appointing over - this need.
\v 4 But we /will_be/_persevering - ˱in˲_prayer and - service ˱of˲_the word.”
\v 5 And the statement brought_pleasure before all the multitude, and ˱they˲_chose Stephen, /a/_man full ˱of˲_faith and ˱of˲_/the/_=> Holy <=_\nd Spirit\nd*, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas /a/_=> Antiochene <=_convert,
\v 6 whom ˱they˲_stood before the ambassadors, and /having/_prayed, ˱they˲_laid_on their hands ˱on˲_them.
\v 7 ¶ And the word ˱of˲_the ˱of˲_\nd God\nd* /was/_growing, and the number ˱of˲_the disciples in Jerusalem /was_being/_multiplied exceedingly, and /a/_great crowd ˱of˲_the priests /were/_submitting ˱in˲_the faith.
\v 8 ¶ And Stephen full ˱of˲_grace and power, /was/_doing wonders and great signs among the people.
\v 9 But some ˱of˲_the of the synagogue, - /being/_called Freedmen, and ˱of˲_Cyrenians, and ˱of˲_Alexandrians, and ˱of˲_the \add ones\add* from Cilicia, and Asia rose_up, debating ˱with˲_the Stephen.
\v 10 And ˱they˲_/were/_were_ not _able /to/_resist ˱against˲_the wisdom and the \nd Spirit\nd*, ˱by˲_whom ˱he˲_/was/_speaking.
\v 11 Then ˱they˲_instigated men saying, - “˱We˲_/have/_heard him speaking slanderous words against Moses and - \nd God\nd*.”
\v 12 And ˱they˲_stirred_up the people, and the elders, and the scribes, and /having/_approached, ˱they˲_seized him and brought \add him\add* to the Sanhedrin,
\v 13 and ˱they˲_set false witnesses saying, “- this man /is/_=> not <=_ceasing speaking words against this the - holy place and the law”,
\v 14 for ˱we˲_/have/_heard him saying that this \nd Jesus\nd* the Nazarene /will_be/_tearing_down - this place, and /will_be/_changing the customs that Moses gave_over ˱to˲_us.
\v 15 And /having/_looked_intently at him, all the \add ones\add* sitting in the Sanhedrin saw the face ˱of˲_him, as_if /the/_face ˱of˲_/an/_angel.
\c 7
\v 1 ¶ And the chief_priest said, “- these \add things\add* /is/_having thus?”
\v 2 And he /was/_saying, “Men, brothers and fathers, hear \add me\add*! The \nd God\nd* - ˱of˲_glory /was/_seen ˱by˲_> Abraham <_the father ˱of˲_us, him being in - Mesopotamia before - /to/_dwell in Haran,
\v 3 and ˱he˲_said to him, ‘come_out from the land ˱of˲_you and from the relatives ˱of˲_you, and come into the land whichever ˱I˲_/will_be/_showing - ˱to˲_you.’
\v 4 Then /having/_come_out from /the/_land ˱of˲_Chaldeans, ˱he˲_dwelt in Haran. And_from_there after the \add time\add* the father ˱of˲_him /to/_die_off, ˱he˲_removed him into - this land, in which you_all /are/_=> now <=_dwelling.
\v 5 And not gave ˱to˲_him /an/_inheritance in it, nor /the/_tribunal ˱of˲_/a/_foot, but ˱he˲_promised ‘/to/_give ˱to˲_him for /a/_possession it, and ˱to˲_the descendants ˱of˲_him after him’, not being ˱to˲_him /a/_child.
\v 6 But - \nd God\nd* spoke thus that will_be the descendants ˱of˲_him, ‘/a/_sojourner in another's land, and ˱they˲_/will_be/_enslaving it and ˱they˲_/will_be/_mistreating \add it\add* four_hundred years.
\v 7 But I - \nd God\nd* /will_be/_judging the nation ˱for˲_whichever - ˱they˲_/may/_serve’, said, ‘and after these \add things\add*, ˱they˲_/will_be/_coming_out and /will_be/_serving ˱unto˲_me in - this place.’
\v 8 And ˱he˲_gave ˱to˲_him /the/_covenant ˱of˲_circumcision; and thus ˱he˲_bore - Isaac, and circumcised him ˱on˲_the - eighth day, and Isaac \add bore\add* - Jacob, and Twelve the Jacob patriarchs.
\v 9 ¶ And the patriarchs /having/_been_jealous - ˱of˲_Joseph, gave_back \add him\add* into Egypt; but - \nd God\nd* was with him,
\v 10 and ˱he˲_rescued him out_of all the tribulations ˱of˲_him, and gave ˱to˲_him favor and wisdom before Pharaoh, king ˱of˲_Egypt, and ˱he˲_appointed him leading \add one\add* over Egypt, and over all the house ˱of˲_him.
\v 11 And /a/_famine came on all the Egypt and Canaan, and great tribulation, and the fathers ˱of˲_us /were/_=> not <=_finding food.
\v 12 But Jacob /having/_heard, being grain in Egypt, sent_away the fathers ˱of˲_us first.
\v 13 And on the second \add time\add*, Joseph /was/_made_known ˱by˲_the brothers ˱of˲_him, and the descent ˱of˲_Joseph ˱it˲_became manifest - ˱to˲_Pharaoh.
\v 14 And Joseph /having/_sent_out, summoned Jacob, the father ˱of˲_him, and all the relatives, in seventy five souls.
\v 15 And Jacob came_down into Egypt, and he and the fathers ˱of˲_us died,
\v 16 and ˱they˲_/were/_replaced to Shechem, and ˱they˲_/were/_put in the tomb, which Abraham purchased ˱for˲_/a/_value ˱of˲_silver from the sons ˱of˲_Emmor in Shechem.
\v 17 ¶ But as the time ˱of˲_the promise, which - \nd God\nd* promised - ˱to˲_Abraham /was/_nearing, the people grew and /was/_multiplied in Egypt,
\v 18 until ‘˱of˲_which another king rose_up over Egypt, who /had/_=> not <=_known - Joseph’.
\v 19 He, /having/_taken_advantage ˱of˲_the race ˱of˲_us, mistreated the fathers - /to_be/_making the babies ˱of˲_them abandoned, in_order that /to_ not _be_being/_kept_alive.
\v 20 In that time Moses /was/_born, and ˱he˲_was beautiful - ˱to˲_\nd God\nd*; who /was/_brought_up three months in the house ˱of˲_the father.
\v 21 And, /having_been/_set_out ˱of˲_him the daughter ˱of˲_Pharaoh took_ him _away, and brought_ him _up ˱for˲_herself for /a/_son.
\v 22 And Moses /was/_instructed in ˱in˲_all /the/_wisdom ˱of˲_/the/_Egyptians, and was powerful in /the/_words and /the/_works ˱of˲_him.
\v 23 ¶ But when /a/_=> forty_year <=_time /was_being/_fulfilled ˱to˲_him, went_up in the heart ˱of˲_him /to/_visit the brothers ˱of˲_him, the sons ˱of˲_Israel.
\v 24 And /having/_seen one /being/_wronged, ˱he˲_retaliated and did vengeance ˱for˲_the \add one\add* /being/_distressed, /having/_struck the Egyptian.
\v 25 And ˱he˲_/was/_thinking the brothers /to_be/_understanding that - \nd God\nd* by /the/_hand ˱of˲_him /is/_giving salvation ˱to˲_them, but they not understood.
\v 26 And ˱on˲_the following day, ˱he˲_/was/_seen ˱to˲_them quarrelling, and ˱he˲_/was/_reconciling them to peace, /having/_said, ‘Men, ˱you_all˲_are brothers. for_ Why _reason /are/_˱you_all˲_injuring one_another?’
\v 27 But the \add one\add* injuring your neighbor pushed_ him _away /having/_said, ‘who appointed you ruler and judge over us?
\v 28 You /are/_=> not <=_wanting /to/_kill me, which manner ˱you˲_killed the Egyptian yesterday?’
\v 29 ‘And Moses fled’ at - this statement, ‘and became /a/_sojourner in /the/_land ˱of˲_Midian’, where ˱he˲_bore two sons.
\v 30 ¶ And forty years /having_been/_fulfilled, ‘/an/_angel /was/_seen ˱to˲_him in the desert - ˱of˲_Mount Sinai, in /a/_flame ˱of˲_fire ˱of˲_/a/_thorn_bush’.
\v 31 And - Moses /having/_seen \add it\add*, marveled ˱at˲_the vision. And him approaching /to/_observe \add it\add*, ˱there˲_became /the/_voice ˱of˲_/the/_\nd Lord\nd*:
\v 32 ‘I \add am\add* the \nd God\nd* ˱of˲_the fathers ˱of˲_you, the \nd God\nd* ˱of˲_Abraham, and ˱of˲_Isaac, and ˱of˲_Jacob.’ And Moses /having/_become trembling, /was/_=> not <=_daring /to/_observe.
\v 33 ‘And the \nd Lord\nd* said ˱to˲_him, ‘untie the sandal ˱of˲_the feet ˱of˲_you, for the place on which ˱you˲_/have/_stood ground is holy.’
\v 34 ‘/Having/_seen, ˱I˲_saw the mistreatment ˱of˲_the people ˱of˲_me - in Egypt, and ˱I˲_heard ˱of˲_the groaning ˱of˲_them, and ˱I˲_came_down /to/_rescue them’; ‘and now come, ˱I˲_/may/_send_ you _out to Egypt.’
\v 35 ¶ This - Moses, whom ˱they˲_disowned /having/_said, ‘who you appointed ruler and judge?’ This \add man\add* - \nd God\nd* /has/_sent_out ruler and redeemer, with /the/_hand ˱of˲_/the/_angel - /having_been/_seen ˱by˲_him in the thorn_bush.
\v 36 This \add man\add* led_ them _out, /having/_done wonders and signs in the Egypt, and in /the/_Red Sea, and in the desert, forty years.
\v 37 This is - Moses the \add man\add* /having/_said ˱to˲_the sons ˱of˲_Israel, ‘- \nd God\nd* /will_be/_raising_up /a/_prophet ˱to˲_you_all, from the brothers ˱of˲_you_all, like me.’
\v 38 This is the \add man\add* /having/_become in the assembly in the desert, with the angel - speaking ˱to˲_him on - Mount Sinai, and ˱of˲_the fathers ˱of˲_us, who received /the/_=> living <=_oracles /to/_give ˱to˲_you_all;
\v 39 ˱to˲_whom the fathers ˱of˲_us willed not /to/_become obedient, but ˱they˲_pushed_away \add him\add* and ˱they˲_/were/_turned in the hearts ˱of˲_them to Egypt,
\v 40 /having/_said - ˱to˲_Aaron, ‘make ˱for˲_us gods who /will_be/_going_before ˱before˲_us. For - this Moses, who led_out us from /the/_land ˱of˲_Egypt, ˱we˲_/have/_=> not <=_known what became ˱to˲_him.’
\v 41 And ˱they˲_made_a_calf in - those days, and ˱they˲_brought_up /a/_sacrifice ˱to˲_the idol, and ˱they˲_/were_being/_gladdened in the works ˱of˲_the hands ˱of˲_them.
\v 42 But - \nd God\nd* turned, and gave_ them _over /to_be/_serving ˱unto˲_the army - ˱of˲_heaven, as ˱it˲_/has_been/_written in scroll ˱of˲_the prophets, ‘˱you_all˲_> not <_offered victims and sacrifices ˱to˲_me, forty years? in the desert, house ˱of˲_Israel?
\v 43 And ˱you_all˲_took_up the tabernacle - ˱of˲_Moloch, and the star ˱of˲_> Romfa <_the god ˱of˲_you_all, the images which ˱you_all˲_made /to_be/_worshipping ˱before˲_them. And ˱I˲_/will_be/_removing you_all beyond Babylon.’
\v 44 ¶ The tabernacle ˱of˲_the testimony was ˱with˲_the fathers ˱of˲_us in the desert, as directed the \add one\add* speaking - ˱to˲_Moses, /to/_make it according_to the pattern that ˱he˲_/had/_seen,
\v 45 which also the fathers ˱of˲_us ˱they˲_brought_in, /having/_inherited with \nd Joshua\nd* in the possession ˱of˲_the nations, whom - \nd God\nd* drove_out from /the/_face ˱of˲_the fathers ˱of˲_us, until the days ˱of˲_David;
\v 46 who found favor before - \nd God\nd*, and requested /to/_find /a/_tent ˱for˲_the house ˱of˲_Jacob.
\v 47 But Solomon built /the/_house ˱for˲_him.
\v 48 But the Highest /is/_=> not <=_dwelling in handmade \add houses\add*, as the prophet /is/_saying,
\v 49 ‘- heaven \add is\add* /a/_throne ˱to˲_me, and the /the/_earth \add is\add* /a/_footstool ˱of˲_the feet ˱of˲_me. What house ˱you_all˲_/will_be/_building ˱for˲_me? /The/_\nd Lord\nd* /is/_saying, or what place \add is\add* ˱of˲_the rest ˱of˲_me?
\v 50 Not the hand ˱of˲_me made all these \add things\add*?’
\v 51 ¶ Stiff-necked and uncircumcised ˱in˲_hearts and the ears, you_all /are/_=> always <=_opposing ˱against˲_the - Holy \nd Spirit\nd*, as \add are\add* the fathers ˱of˲_you_all, you_all also.

\v 54 ¶ And ¶ hearing these \add things\add*, ˱they˲_/were_being/_cut_through ˱in˲_the hearts ˱of˲_them, and ˱they˲_/were/_gnashing their teeth at him.
\v 55 But being full ˱of˲_/the/_=> Holy <=_\nd Spirit\nd*, /having/_looked_intently into - heaven, ˱he˲_saw /the/_glory ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*, and \nd Jesus\nd* /having/_stood by /the/_right \add hand\add* - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*,
\v 56 and said, “Behold, ˱I˲_/am/_observing the heavens /having_been/_opened_up, and the Son - ˱of˲_Man /having/_stood by /the/_right \add hand\add* - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*.”
\v 57 But /having/_cried_out ˱with˲_/a/_=> loud <=_voice, ˱they˲_held the ears ˱of˲_them, and ˱they˲_rushed with_one_accord on him.
\v 58 And /having/_cast_out \add him\add* out the city, ˱they˲_/were/_stoning. And the witnesses put_away the robes ˱of˲_them, before the feet ˱of˲_/a/_young_man /being/_named Saul.
\v 59 And ˱they˲_/were/_stoning - Stephen, ˱who˲_calling and saying, “\nd Lord\nd* \nd Jesus\nd*, receive the spirit ˱of˲_me.”
\v 60 And /having/_knelt ˱on˲_his knees, ˱he˲_cried_out ˱with˲_/a/_=> loud <=_voice, “\nd Lord\nd*, ˱you˲_/may/_=> not <=_set this - sin ˱to˲_them.” And /having/_said this, ˱he˲_/was/_fallen_asleep.
\c 8
\v 1 And Saul was consenting ˱to˲_the killing ˱of˲_him. ¶ And /a/_=> great <=_persecution became on that - day, against the assembly, which \add was\add* in Jerusalem. And all /were/_dispersed throughout the regions - ˱of˲_Judea and Samaria, except the ambassadors.
\v 2 And devout men buried - Stephen, and ˱they˲_made great lamentation over him.
\v 3 But Saul /was/_ravaging the assembly, by entering_in the houses, dragging both men and women, ˱he˲_/was/_giving_over \add them\add* to prison.
\v 4 ¶ The \add ones\add* therefore on_one_hand /having_been/_dispersed, passed_through gospel_preaching the word.
\v 5 On_the_other_hand Philip /having/_come_down to - /a/_city - ˱of˲_Samaria, /was/_proclaiming the \nd Messiah\nd* ˱to˲_them.
\v 6 and the crowds /Were/_taking_heed ˱to˲_the \add things\add* /being/_spoken by - Philip with_one_accord, in the \add time\add* /to_be/_hearing them and /to_be/_seeing the signs that ˱he˲_/was/_doing.
\v 7 For many ˱of˲_the \add ones\add* having unclean spirits, shouting ˱with˲_/a/_=> loud <=_voice, ˱they˲_/were/_coming_out, and many /having_been/_paralyzed and lame /were/_healed.
\v 8 and great joy became in - that city.
\v 9 ¶ And /a/_man certain ˱by˲_/the/_name Simon, /was/_previously_starting in the city practicing_magic, and amazing the people - ˱of˲_Samaria, saying himself to_be someone great.
\v 10 ˱To˲_whom all from small to great /were/_giving_heed saying, “This is the Power - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*, - /being/_called Great.”
\v 11 And ˱they˲_/were/_giving_heed ˱to˲_him, because_of that /to_have/_amazed them ˱with˲_the magic ˱for˲_much time.
\v 12 But when ˱they˲_believed - ˱in˲_Philip, gospel_preaching concerning the Kingdom the ˱of˲_\nd God\nd* and the name ˱of˲_\nd Jesus\nd* \nd Christ\nd*, ˱they˲_/were_being/_baptized both men and women.
\v 13 And - Simon himself also believed, and /having_been/_baptized, was continuing - ˱with˲_Philip, observing both signs and great miracles becoming, ˱he˲_/was/_marveling.
\v 14 ¶ And the ambassadors in Jerusalem /having/_heard that - Samaria /has/_received the word - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*, ˱they˲_sent_out Peter and John to them,
\v 15 who /having/_come_down, ˱they˲_prayed for them, so_that ˱they˲_/may/_receive /the/_=> Holy <=_\nd Spirit\nd*.
\v 16 For ˱it˲_was not_yet /having/_fallen_on on no_one ˱of˲_them, but ˱they˲_/were/_=> only <=_being /having_been/_baptized into the name ˱of˲_the \nd Lord\nd* \nd Jesus\nd*.
\v 17 Then ˱they˲_/were/_laying_on their hands on them, and ˱they˲_/were/_receiving /the/_=> Holy <=_\nd Spirit\nd*.
\v 18 And - Simon /having/_seen that the \nd Spirit\nd* /is_being/_given by the laying_on ˱of˲_the hands ˱of˲_the ambassadors, ˱he˲_offered money ˱to˲_them
\v 19 saying, “Give ˱to˲_also_me - this authority, in_order_that ˱on˲_whom - ˱I˲_/may/_lay_on my hands, ˱he˲_/may_be/_receiving /the/_=> Holy <=_\nd Spirit\nd*.”
\v 20 But Peter said to him, “The silver ˱of˲_you, ˱it˲_might_be to destruction with you, because ˱you˲_thought /to_be/_acquiring the gift - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd* by money.
\v 21 ˱There˲_is no portion nor lot ˱to˲_you in - this matter. For the heart ˱of˲_you not is right before - \nd God\nd*.
\v 22 Therefore repent of - this evil ˱of˲_you, and /be/_besought ˱of˲_the \nd Lord\nd* if perhaps the intention ˱of˲_the heart ˱of˲_you /will_be_being/_forgiven ˱to˲_you.
\v 23 For ˱I˲_/am/_seeing you being in /the/_gall ˱of˲_bitterness and /the/_bond ˱of˲_unrighteousness.”
\v 24 But - Simon answering said, “You_all “/Be/_besought for me to the \nd Lord\nd*, so_that nothing ˱of˲_which ˱you_all˲_/have/_spoken” /may/_come_over on me.
\v 25 ¶ Therefore they indeed, /having/_testified and /having/_spoken the word ˱of˲_the \nd Lord\nd*, /were/_returning to Jerusalem, and ˱they˲_/were/_evangelizing many villages ˱of˲_the Samaritans.
\v 26 ¶ But /an/_angel ˱of˲_/the/_\nd Lord\nd* spoke to Philip saying, “Rise_up and /be/_going to /the/_south, to the road - coming_down from Jerusalem to Gaza”; this is /the/_desert \add road\add*.
\v 27 And /having/_risen_up, ˱he˲_/was/_gone, and behold, /a/_man, /an/_Ethiopian eunuch, official ˱of˲_Candace queen ˱of˲_/the/_Ethiopians, who was over all the treasure ˱of˲_her, /had/_come /going_to/_worship in Jerusalem,
\v 28 and ˱he˲_was returning and sitting in the chariot ˱of˲_him, and /was/_reading the prophet Isaiah.
\v 29 And the \nd Spirit\nd* said - ˱to˲_Philip, “Approach and /be/_joined_together - ˱to˲_> this <_chariot.”
\v 30 And - Philip /having/_run_up, heard ˱of˲_him reading Isaiah the prophet, and said, “Then surely ˱you˲_/are/_knowing what ˱you˲_/are/_reading?”
\v 31 And he said, “For how - ˱I˲_/might_be/_able if not someone /will_be/_guiding me?” And ˱he˲_appealed - ˱to˲_Philip /having/_gone_up /to/_sit_down with him.
\v 32 And the passage - ˱of˲_Scripture which ˱he˲_/was/_reading was this: “˱he˲_/was/_led as /a/_sheep to /the/_slaughter, and silent as /a/_lamb before the \add one\add* /having/_shaved him, thus ˱he˲_/is/_=> not <=_opening_up the mouth ˱of˲_him.
\v 33 In - humiliation, the justice ˱of˲_him /was/_taken_away, who /will_be/_describing the generation ˱of˲_him? Because the life ˱of˲_him /is_being/_taken_away from the earth.”
\v 34 And the eunuch answering - ˱to˲_Philip said, “˱I˲_/am/_beseeching ˱of˲_you concerning whom the prophet /is/_saying this? Concerning himself or concerning someone other?”
\v 35 And - Philip /having/_opened_up the mouth ˱of˲_him, and /having/_begun from - this Scripture, ˱he˲_gospel_preached - \nd Jesus\nd* ˱to˲_him.
\v 36 And as ˱they˲_/were/_going along the road, ˱they˲_came to some water, and the eunuch /is/_saying, “Behold, water, what /is/_forbidding me /to_be/_baptized?”
\v 37
\v 38 And ˱he˲_commanded the chariot /to/_stop, and ˱they˲_> both <_came_down, to the water, - both Philip and the eunuch, and ˱he˲_baptized him.
\v 39 But when ˱they˲_went_up out_of the water, /the/_\nd Spirit\nd* ˱of˲_/the/_\nd Lord\nd* snatched - Philip, and the eunuch not saw him no_longer, for ˱he˲_/was/_going the way ˱of˲_him rejoicing.
\v 40 But Philip /was/_found at Azotus, and passing_through ˱he˲_/was/_gospel_preaching ˱to˲_> all <_the cities, until the \add time\add* him /to/_come to Caesarea.
\c 9
\v 1 ¶ But - Saul, still breathing ˱of˲_threat and murder toward the disciples ˱of˲_the \nd Lord\nd*, /having/_approached ˱to˲_the chief_priest,
\v 2 ˱he˲_requested letters from him to the synagogues into Damascus, so_that if ˱he˲_/may/_find any ˱of˲_the way, being both men and women, /having_been/_bound ˱he˲_/may/_bring \add them\add* to Jerusalem.
\v 3 And in the \add time\add* /to_be/_going, ˱it˲_became him /to_be/_nearing - ˱to˲_Damascus, and suddenly /a/_light from the sky. flashed_around. him.
\v 4 And /having/_fallen on the ground, ˱he˲_heard /a/_voice saying ˱to˲_him, “Saul, Saul, why /are/_˱you˲_persecuting me?”
\v 5 And ˱he˲_said, “Who are_˱you˲, lord?” and_> He <_\add said\add*, “I am \nd Jesus\nd*, whom you /are/_persecuting;
\v 6 but rise_up and come_in into the city, and ˱it˲_/will_be_being/_spoken ˱to˲_you what something ˱it˲_/is/_fitting you /to_be/_doing.”
\v 7 And the men who travelling_with ˱with˲_him /had/_stood speechless, hearing on_one_hand ˱of˲_the voice, on_the_other_hand observing no_one.
\v 8 And Saul /was/_raised from the ground, and the eyes ˱of˲_him /having_been/_opened_up, ˱he˲_/was/_seeing nothing. And leading_ him _by_hand, ˱they˲_brought_in \add him\add* to Damascus.
\v 9 And ˱he˲_was three days not seeing, and neither ˱he˲_ate nor ˱he˲_drank.
\v 10 ¶ And was /a/_certain disciple in Damascus ˱by˲_/the/_name Ananias, and the \nd Lord\nd* said to him in /a/_vision, “Ananias.” And he said, “Behold, \add it_is\add* I, \nd Lord\nd*.”
\v 11 And the \nd Lord\nd* to him, “/Having/_risen_up, /be/_gone in the street - /being/_called Straight, and seek Saul ˱by˲_/the/_name Tarsian in /the/_house ˱of˲_Judas, for behold, ˱he˲_/is/_praying
\v 12 and ˱he˲_saw /a/_man in /a/_vision, ˱by˲_/the/_name Ananias, /having/_come_in and /having/_put_on /his/_hands ˱on˲_him, so_that ˱he˲_/may/_receive_sight.”
\v 13 And Ananias answered, “\nd Lord\nd*, ˱I˲_heard from many concerning - this man, as_much_as ˱he˲_did evil ˱to˲_the holy \add ones\add* ˱of˲_you; in Jerusalem;
\v 14 and here ˱he˲_/is/_having authority from the chief_priests, /to/_bind all - calling the name ˱of˲_you.”
\v 15 But the \nd Lord\nd* said to him, “/Be/_going, because this \add man\add* is /a/_vessel ˱of˲_choice ˱to˲_me, - /to/_bear the name ˱of˲_me both before the pagans also kings, and /the/_sons ˱of˲_Israel,
\v 16 for I /will_be/_showing ˱to˲_him as_much_as ˱it˲_/is/_fitting him /to/_suffer for the name ˱of˲_me.”
\v 17 And Ananias went_away and came_in into the house, and /having/_laid_on on him his hands ˱he˲_said, “Saul, brother, the \nd Lord\nd* /has/_sent_out me \nd Jesus\nd*, the \add one\add* /having_been/_seen ˱by˲_you on the road ˱in˲_which ˱you˲_/were/_coming, so_that ˱you˲_/may/_receive_sight and /may_be/_filled ˱with˲_/the/_=> Holy <=_\nd Spirit\nd*.”
\v 18 And immediately fell_away \add something\add* ˱of˲_him from the eyes like scales, and, ˱he˲_received_sight, and /having/_risen_up ˱he˲_/was/_baptized,
\v 19 and /having/_taken food, /was/_strengthened. ¶ And ˱he˲_became some days with the disciples in Damascus.
\v 20 And immediately in the synagogues, ˱he˲_/was/_proclaiming - \nd Jesus\nd* that this \add one\add* is the Son - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*.
\v 21 And all /were/_marveling - hearing, and ˱they˲_/were/_saying, “Is not this the \add one\add* /having/_persecuted the \add ones\add* calling - this name in, Jerusalem, and here for this ˱he˲_/had/_come, in_order_that /having_been/_bound, ˱he˲_/may/_bring them to the chief_priests?”
\v 22 But Saul /was_being/_=> more <=_strengthened, and /was/_confounding Jews - dwelling in Damascus, teaching that this \add one\add* is the \nd Messiah\nd*.
\v 23 ¶ And when many days /were_being/_fulfilled, the Jews plotted_together /to/_kill him;
\v 24 but the plot ˱of˲_them /was/_known - ˱to˲_Saul. and ˱They˲_/were/_watching_closely also the gates both day and night, so_that ˱they˲_/may/_kill him;
\v 25 and the disciples ˱of˲_him /having/_taken \add him\add* ˱by˲_night through the wall, ˱they˲_let_ him _down, /having/_lowered \add him\add* in /a/_basket.
\v 26 ¶ And /having/_arrived in Jerusalem, ˱he˲_/was/_attempting /to_be_being/_joined_together ˱to˲_the disciples. But all /were/_fearing him, not believing that ˱he˲_is /a/_disciple.
\v 27 But Barnabas /having/_taken_hold_of him, brought \add him\add* to the ambassadors, and described ˱to˲_them how ˱he˲_saw the \nd Lord\nd* on the road, and that ˱he˲_spoke ˱to˲_him, and how ˱he˲_spoke_boldly in Damascus in the name ˱of˲_\nd Jesus\nd*.
\v 28 And ˱he˲_was with them, entering_in and going_out into Jerusalem, speaking_boldly in the name ˱of˲_the \nd Lord\nd*.
\v 29 ˱He˲_/was/_=> both <=_speaking and /was/_debating with the Hellenists; but they /were/_attempting /to/_kill him.
\v 30 But /having/_known \add it\add*, the brothers brought_ him _down to Caesarea, and ˱they˲_sent_ him _away to Tarsus.
\v 31 The indeed ¶ Therefore assembly throughout all - ˱of˲_Judea, and Galilee, and Samaria, /was/_having peace, /being/_built and going ˱in˲_the fear ˱of˲_the \nd Lord\nd*, and ˱it˲_/was_being/_multiplied ˱in˲_the exhortation ˱of˲_the Holy \nd Spirit\nd*.
\v 32 ¶ And ˱it˲_became Peter passing_through through all \add regions\add*, /to/_come_down also to the holy \add ones\add* - dwelling_in Lydda.
\v 33 And ˱he˲_found there /a/_=> certain <=_man ˱by˲_/the/_name Eneas, lying_down for eight years on /a/_pallet, who was /having_been/_paralyzed.
\v 34 And - Peter said ˱to˲_him, “Eneas, \nd Jesus\nd* \nd Christ\nd* /is/_healing you; rise_up, and make_the_bed ˱for˲_yourself.” And immediately ˱he˲_rose_up.
\v 35 And all the \add ones\add* dwelling_in Lydda and - Saron, saw him, who turned_back to the \nd Lord\nd*.
\v 36 ¶ And in Joppa was /a/_certain disciple ˱by˲_/the/_name Tabitha, which /being/_interpreted /is_being/_called, “/the/_Gazelle|Dorcas”. She was full ˱of˲_> good <_works, and ˱of˲_alms that ˱she˲_/was/_doing.
\v 37 And ˱it˲_became in - those days, she /having/_ailed /to/_die_off. And /having/_washed her ˱they˲_put in /an/_upper_room.
\v 38 And Lydda being near - ˱to˲_Joppa, the disciples /having/_heard that Peter is in it, ˱they˲_sent_out two men to him imploring, “˱You˲_/may/_=> not <=_delay /to/_pass_through to us.”
\v 39 And Peter /having/_risen_up, came_together ˱with˲_them, who /having/_arrived, ˱they˲_brought_up into the upper_room, and all the widows stood_by ˱by˲_him, weeping and showing /the/_tunics and clothes, as_much_as - Dorcas /was/_making being with them.
\v 40 But - Peter /having/_cast_out all outside, and /having/_knelt his knees ˱he˲_prayed, and /having/_turned_back to the body said, “Tabitha, rise_up!” And she opened_up the eyes ˱of˲_her, and /having/_seen - Peter, ˱she˲_sat_up.
\v 41 And /having/_given /his/_hand ˱to˲_her, ˱he˲_raised_ her _up, and /having/_called the holy \add ones\add* and the widows, ˱he˲_presented her living.
\v 42 And ˱it˲_became known throughout all ˱of˲_Joppa, and many believed on the \nd Lord\nd*.
\v 43 And ˱it˲_became many days /to/_remain in Joppa, with /a/_certain Simon, /a/_tanner.
\c 10
\v 1 ¶ And /a/_=> certain <=_man in Caesarea ˱by˲_/the/_name Cornelius, /a/_centurion of ˱of˲_/the/_Cohort - /being/_called Italian,
\v 2 devout and revering - \nd God\nd* with all the household ˱of˲_him, doing many alms ˱to˲_the people, and beseeching - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd* through everything.
\v 3 About /the/_ninth hour ˱of˲_the day ˱he˲_saw in /a/_vision clearly, as_if, /an/_angel - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd* /having/_come_in to him, and /having/_said ˱to˲_him, “Cornelius!”
\v 4 And he, /having/_looked_intently ˱at˲_him and /having/_become frightened, said, “What is_˱it˲, lord?” And ˱he˲_said ˱to˲_him, “The prayers ˱of˲_you, and the alms ˱of˲_you, went_up for /a/_memorial before - \nd God\nd*.
\v 5 And now send men to Joppa, and send_for /a/_certain Simon, who /is_being/_called Peter.
\v 6 This \add one\add* /is_being/_lodged with /a/_certain Simon /a/_tanner, whose house is by /the/_sea.”
\v 7 And when the angel - speaking ˱to˲_him, went_away, /having/_called two ˱of˲_the house_servants and /a/_=> devout <=_soldier ˱of˲_the \add ones\add* continuing ˱with˲_him,
\v 8 and /having/_explained all \add things\add* ˱to˲_them, ˱he˲_sent_ them _out to - Joppa.
\v 9 ¶ And ˱on˲_the \add day\add* of_next, those journeying and nearing ˱to˲_the city, Peter went_up on the housetop /to/_pray, about /the/_hour sixth.
\v 10 But ˱he˲_became hungry and /was/_wanting /to/_taste, but them preparing, /a/_trance became on him,
\v 11 and ˱he˲_/is/_observing - heaven /having_been/_opened_up, and /an/_=> certain <=_object coming_down, as /a/_=> ˱by˲_four <=_linen_sheet, great corners /being/_let_down on the earth,
\v 12 in which /was/_being all the quadrupeds, and reptiles ˱of˲_the earth, and birds ˱of˲_the sky.
\v 13 And /a/_voice became to him: “/Having/_risen_up, Peter, sacrifice and eat!”
\v 14 But - Peter said, “By_no_means, \nd Lord\nd*, because ˱I˲_> never <_ate any common and unclean \add thing\add*.”
\v 15 And /a/_voice \add said\add* again for /the/_second \add time\add* to him: “What - \nd God\nd* cleansed, you /be/_=> not <=_defiling.”
\v 16 And this became for thrice, and immediately the object /was/_taken_up into - heaven.
\v 17 ¶ And while - Peter by himself /was/_thoroughly_perplexing, what - might_be the vision that ˱he˲_saw, behold, the men - /having_been/_sent_out from - Cornelius, /having/_inquired ˱for˲_the house - ˱of˲_Simon, stood_by at the gate.
\v 18 And /having/_called, ˱they˲_/were/_inquiring if Simon, who \add is\add* /being/_called Peter, /is_being/_lodged here.
\v 19 And - Peter pondering about the vision, the \nd Spirit\nd* said, ˱to˲_him, “Behold, three men /are/_seeking you.
\v 20 But /having/_risen_up, come_down and /be/_going with them, doubting nothing, because I /have/_sent_ them _out.”
\v 21 And Peter /having/_come_down, to the men said, “Behold, I am whom ˱you_all˲_/are/_seeking; what \add is\add* the cause for which ˱you_all˲_/are/_coming?”
\v 22 And they said, “Cornelius /a/_centurion, righteous man and revering - \nd God\nd*, and /being/_attested by all the nation ˱of˲_the Jews, /was/_called by /an/_=> holy <=_angel, /to/_send_for you to the house ˱of˲_him, and /to/_hear words from you.”
\v 23 Therefore /having/_called_ them _in. ˱he˲_lodged. ¶ And ˱on˲_the \add day\add* of_next /having/_risen_up, ˱he˲_came_out with them, and some ˱of˲_the brothers - from Joppa came_together ˱with˲_him.
\v 24 And ˱on˲_the \add day\add* of_next, ˱he˲_came_in into - Caesarea. And - Cornelius was expecting them, /having/_called_together the relatives ˱of˲_him and - close friends.
\v 25 And as ˱it˲_became - - Peter, /to/_come_in Cornelius /having/_met ˱with˲_him -, /having/_fallen at his feet, ˱he˲_worshipped \add him\add*.
\v 26 But - Peter raised him saying, “Rise_up; I also myself am /a/_human.”
\v 27 And conversing ˱with˲_him, ˱he˲_came_in and ˱he˲_/is/_finding many /having/_come_together.
\v 28 And ˱he˲_/was/_saying to them, “You_all /are/_knowing how unlawful ˱it˲_is ˱for˲_/a/_=> Jewish <=_man /to_be_being/_joined_together or /to_be/_approaching ˱to˲_/an/_other_tribe. - \nd God\nd* ˱to˲_and_ showed _me, /to_be/_calling not_one /a/_person common or unclean.
\v 29 Therefore also /having_been/_sent_for ˱I˲_came unquestionably. Therefore ˱I˲_/am/_inquiring ˱for˲_what statement ˱you_all˲_sent_for me?”
\v 30 ¶ And - Cornelius /was/_saying, “From fourth day until this - hour, ˱I˲_was praying in the house ˱of˲_me the ninth \add hour\add*, and behold, /a/_man stood before me in shining clothing,
\v 31 and ˱he˲_/is/_saying, ‘Cornelius, the prayer ˱of˲_you /was/_listened_to and the alms ˱of˲_you /were/_reminded before - \nd God\nd*.
\v 32 Therefore send to Joppa and summon Simon, who /is_being/_called Peter; this \add one\add* /is_being/_lodged in /the/_house ˱of˲_Simon, /a/_tanner by /the/_sea.’
\v 33 Therefore ˱I˲_> immediately <_sent to you, and you did well therefore. /having/_arrived now we all /are/_being_present before - \nd God\nd*, /to/_hear all the \add things\add* /having_been/_commanded ˱to˲_you by the \nd Lord\nd*.”
\v 34 ¶ And Peter /having/_opened_up - mouth said, “In truth ˱I˲_/am/_grasping that - \nd God\nd* is not /a/_favorer,
\v 35 but in every nation, the \add one\add* revering him and working righteousness, is acceptable ˱to˲_him.
\v 36 The word ˱he˲_sent_out ˱to˲_the sons ˱of˲_Israel, gospel_preaching peace through \nd Jesus\nd* \nd Christ\nd*; this \add one\add* is \nd Lord\nd* ˱of˲_all.
\v 37 You_all /have/_known the word /having/_become throughout all - Judea, /having/_begun from - Galilee, after the baptism that John proclaimed,
\v 38 \nd Jesus\nd* - from Nazareth, how - \nd God\nd* anointed him ˱with˲_/the/_=> Holy <=_\nd Spirit\nd* and power, who passed_through doing_good and healing all the \add ones\add* /being/_oppressed by the devil, because - \nd God\nd* was with him.
\v 39 And we \add are\add* witnesses ˱of˲_all \add things\add* that ˱he˲_did both in the region ˱of˲_the Jews and in ˱in˲_Jerusalem; whom also ˱they˲_killed, /having/_hanged \add him\add* on /a/_cross.
\v 40 This \add one\add* - \nd God\nd* raised ˱on˲_the third day, and gave him /to/_become manifest,
\v 41 not ˱to˲_all the people, but ˱to˲_/the/_witnesses - /having_been/_previously_appointed by - \nd God\nd*, ˱to˲_us, who ate_with and drank_with ˱with˲_him after the \add time\add* him /to/_rise_up from /the/_dead.
\v 42 And ˱he˲_commanded ˱to˲_us /to/_proclaim ˱to˲_the people, and /to/_testify that this \add one\add* is the \add one\add* /having_been/_designated by - \nd God\nd*, ˱as˲_judge ˱of˲_/the/_living and /the/_dead.
\v 43 ˱To˲_this \add one\add* all the prophets /are/_testifying, everyone - believing in him /to/_receive forgiveness ˱of˲_sins through the name ˱of˲_him.”
\v 44 ¶ - Peter still speaking - these words, the - Holy \nd Spirit\nd* fell_on on all the \add ones\add* hearing the word.
\v 45 And the believers from /the/_circumcision, as_many_as came_together - ˱with˲_Peter marveled, that the gift ˱of˲_the Holy \nd Spirit\nd* /has_been/_poured_out even on the pagans.
\v 46 For ˱they˲_/were/_hearing ˱of˲_them speaking ˱with˲_tongues, and magnifying - \nd God\nd*. Then Peter answered,
\v 47 “Surely_not anyone /is/_able /to/_forbid the water these - /to_ not _be/_baptized, who received the - Holy \nd Spirit\nd*, as we_> also <_\add did\add*?”
\v 48 and ˱He˲_commanded them in the name ˱of˲_\nd Jesus\nd* \nd Christ\nd* /to_be/_baptized. Then ˱they˲_asked him /to/_remain_on some days.
\c 11
\v 1 ¶ And the ambassadors and the brothers - being in - Judea heard that the pagans also received the word - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*.
\v 2 and when Peter went_up to Jerusalem, the \add ones\add* of /the/_circumcision /were/_doubting with him,
\v 3 saying, that “˱He˲_came_in to men, having uncircumcision, and ate_with ˱with˲_them.”
\v 4 But Peter /having/_begun, /was/_explaining ˱to˲_them consecutively, saying,
\v 5 “I was in /the/_city ˱of˲_Joppa praying, and in /a/_trance ˱I˲_saw /a/_vision, /an/_=> certain <=_object coming_down like /a/_=> ˱by˲_/its/_four <=_linen_sheet, great corners /being/_let_down out_of - heaven, and ˱it˲_came until me;
\v 6 on which /having/_looked_intently ˱I˲_/was/_observing, and ˱I˲_saw the quadrupeds ˱of˲_the earth, and the wild_beasts, and the reptiles, and the birds ˱of˲_the sky.
\v 7 And ˱I˲_> also <_heard ˱from˲_/a/_voice saying ˱to˲_me, ‘Peter /having/_risen_up, sacrifice and eat.’
\v 8 But ˱I˲_said ‘By_no_means, \nd Lord\nd*, because common or unclean never came_in into the mouth ˱of˲_me.’
\v 9 But /the/_voice answered for /a/_second \add time\add* out_of - heaven, ‘What - \nd God\nd* cleansed, you /be/_=> not <=_defiling.’
\v 10 And this became for thrice, and all /was/_pulled_up again into - heaven.
\v 11 And behold, immediately three men stood_by at the house in which ˱we˲_were, /having_been/_sent_out from Caesarea to me.
\v 12 And the \nd Spirit\nd* told ˱to˲_me, /to/_come_together ˱with˲_them, /having/_doubted nothing. And these - six brothers also came with me, and ˱we˲_came_in into the house ˱of˲_the man.
\v 13 ˱He˲_reported and ˱to˲_us how ˱he˲_saw the angel in the house ˱of˲_him, /having_been/_stood and /having/_said, ‘Send_out to Joppa, and send_for Simon, the \add one\add* /being/_called Peter,
\v 14 who /will_be/_speaking words to you, in which you /will_be_being/_saved and all the household ˱of˲_you.’
\v 15 And at the \add time\add* me /to/_begin /to_be/_speaking, the - Holy \nd Spirit\nd* fell_on on them, as also on us in /the/_beginning.
\v 16 And ˱I˲_/was/_reminded ˱of˲_the word ˱of˲_the \nd Lord\nd*, how ˱he˲_/was/_saying, ‘John on_one_hand baptized ˱with˲_water, on_the_other_hand you_all /will_be_being/_baptized with /the/_=> Holy <=_\nd Spirit\nd*.’
\v 17 Therefore if - \nd God\nd* gave the same gift ˱to˲_them, as also ˱to˲_us /having/_believed on the \nd Lord\nd* \nd Jesus\nd* \nd Christ\nd*, who was I powerful /to/_forbid - \nd God\nd*?”
\v 18 And /having/_heard these \add things\add*, ˱they˲_kept_quiet and glorified - \nd God\nd* saying, “Consequently - \nd God\nd* also gave - repentance to life ˱to˲_the pagans.”
\v 19 ¶ The \add ones\add* therefore indeed /having_been/_dispersed by the tribulation - /having/_become concerning Stephen, passed_through to Phoenicia, and Cyprus, and Antioch, speaking the word ˱to˲_no_one except - only ˱to˲_Jews.
\v 20 But were some of them men, Cyprians and Cyrenians, who /having/_come into Antioch, /were/_speaking also to the Greeks, gospel_preaching the \nd Lord\nd* \nd Jesus\nd*.
\v 21 And /the/_hand ˱of˲_/the/_\nd Lord\nd* was with them, and /a/_great number - /having/_believed, turned_back to the \nd Lord\nd*.
\v 22 And the word concerning them /was/_heard in the ears ˱of˲_the assembly - being in Jerusalem, and ˱they˲_sent_away Barnabas as_far_as Antioch;
\v 23 who /having/_arrived, and /having/_seen the grace - - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*, /was/_elated and /was/_exhorting all /to_be/_remaining ˱with˲_the \nd Lord\nd* - ˱with˲_purpose - ˱of˲_heart,
\v 24 because ˱he˲_was /a/_=> good <=_man, and full ˱of˲_/the/_=> Holy <=_\nd Spirit\nd* and ˱of˲_faith. And /a/_=> large <=_crowd /was/_added ˱to˲_the \nd Lord\nd*.
\v 25 And ˱he˲_came_out to Tarsus /to/_seek_out Saul,
\v 26 and /having/_found \add him\add*, ˱he˲_brought \add him\add* to Antioch. And ˱it˲_became ˱to˲_them also /to_be/_gathered_together in the assembly /a/_=> whole <=_year, and /to/_teach /a/_=> large <=_crowd, and /to/_call first the disciples, Christians. in. Antioch.
\v 27 ¶ And in these - days, prophets came_down from Jerusalem to Antioch.
\v 28 And one from them ˱by˲_/the/_name Agabus /having/_stood_up, signified by the \nd Spirit\nd*, /a/_=> great <=_famine /to_be/_going going_to_be over all the inhabited_world; which became during Claudius.
\v 29 And as anyone ˱of˲_the disciples /was/_prospering, each ˱of˲_them designated /to/_send for service ˱to˲_the brothers dwelling in - Judea;
\v 30 which ˱they˲_> also <_did, /having/_sent_out \add it\add* to the elders by /the/_hand ˱of˲_Barnabas and Saul.
\c 12
\v 1 ¶ And concerning that - time, Herod the king laid_on - /his/_hands /to/_mistreat some ˱of˲_the \add ones\add* from the assembly.
\v 2 And ˱he˲_killed Jacobus, the brother ˱of˲_John, ˱with˲_/a/_sword.
\v 3 And /having/_seen that is pleasing ˱it˲_the Jews, ˱he˲_proceeded /to/_=> also <=_capture Peter (and ˱those˲_were /the/_days - ˱of˲_Unleavened \add Bread\add*),
\v 4 whom also /having/_arrested, ˱he˲_put in prison, /having/_given_over \add him\add* ˱to˲_four squads_of_four ˱of˲_soldiers /to_be/_guarding him, wishing after the Passover /to/_bring_ him _up ˱to˲_the people.
\v 5 - therefore on_one_hand Peter /was_being/_kept in the prison; on_the_other_hand prayer was earnestly becoming by the assembly to - \nd God\nd* concerning him.
\v 6 ¶ And when - Herod /was/_going /to/_bring_ him _forth - ˱on˲_> that <_night, - Peter was /being/_fallen_asleep between two soldiers, /having_been/_bound ˱with˲_> two <_chains, and guards before the door /were/_guarding the prison.
\v 7 And behold, /an/_angel ˱of˲_/the/_\nd Lord\nd* stood_by, and /a/_light shined in the prison_cell. And /having/_struck the side - ˱of˲_Peter, ˱he˲_raised him saying, “Rise_up in quickness.” And the chains from his hands fell_from. ˱of˲_him.
\v 8 And the angel said to him, “Gird \add yourself\add* and tie_on the sandals ˱of˲_you.” And ˱he˲_did thus. And ˱he˲_/is/_saying ˱to˲_him, “Clothe the coat ˱of˲_you, and /be/_following ˱after˲_me.”
\v 9 And /having/_come_out ˱he˲_/was/_following, and ˱he˲_/had/_=> not <=_known that what becoming by the angel is true, but ˱he˲_/was/_supposing /to_be/_seeing /a/_vision.
\v 10 And /having/_passed_through /the/_first guard and /the/_second, ˱they˲_came to the - iron gate, - leading into the city, which automatic /was/_opened_up ˱to˲_them, and /having/_come_out ˱they˲_went_ahead ˱on˲_> one <_street, and immediately the angel withdrew from him.
\v 11 And - Peter /having/_become to himself said, “Now ˱I˲_/have/_=> truly <=_known that \nd Lord\nd* sent_away the angel ˱of˲_him, and rescued me out_of /the/_hand ˱of˲_Herod and all the expectation ˱of˲_the people ˱of˲_the Jews.”
\v 12 ¶ And /having/_become_aware_of \add it\add*, ˱he˲_came to the house - ˱of˲_Mary, the mother ˱of˲_John, who \add is\add* /being/_called Mark, where many were /having_been/_convened_together and praying.
\v 13 And ˱of˲_him /having/_knocked the door ˱of˲_the gate, /a/_servant_girl ˱by˲_/the/_name Rhoda went_ahead /to/_answer.
\v 14 And /having/_recognized the voice - ˱of˲_Peter, from - joy ˱she˲_> not <_opened_up the gate, but /having/_run_in ˱she˲_reported - Peter /to_have/_stood before the gate.
\v 15 And they to her said, “˱You˲_/are/_raving_mad!” But she /was/_insisting /to_be/_having thus. And they /were/_saying, “˱It˲_is the angel ˱of˲_him.”
\v 16 But - Peter /was/_continuing_on knocking, and /having/_opened_up \add it\add* ˱they˲_saw him, and ˱they˲_marveled.
\v 17 But /having/_gestured ˱to˲_them ˱with˲_his hand /to_be/_keeping_silent, ˱he˲_described how the \nd Lord\nd* led_ him _out from the prison. And ˱he˲_said, “Report these \add things\add* ˱to˲_Jacobus and ˱to˲_the brothers.” And /having/_come_out, ˱he˲_/was/_gone to another place.
\v 18 ¶ And /having/_become day, ˱there˲_was no little disturbance among the soldiers, what consequently became - Peter.
\v 19 And Herod /having/_sought_after him and not /having/_found \add him\add*, /having/_examined the guards, commanded \add them\add* /to_be/_led_away \add to_death\add*. And /having/_come_down from - Judea to Caesarea, ˱he˲_/was/_staying.
\v 20 And ˱he˲_was raging ˱with˲_/the/_Tyrians and Sidon; and with_one_accord ˱they˲_/were/_coming to him, and /having/_persuaded Blastus, who \add was\add* over the bedchamber ˱of˲_the king, ˱they˲_/were/_requesting peace, because_of that the region ˱of˲_them /to_be_being/_nourished by the royal.
\v 21 And ˱on˲_/the/_appointed day, - Herod, /having/_dressed_in /the/_royal clothing, /having/_sat_down on the tribunal, /was/_publicly_addressing to them.
\v 22 And the public /was/_crying_out, “/The/_voice ˱of˲_/a/_\nd God\nd*, and not ˱of˲_/a/_human!”
\v 23 And immediately /an/_angel ˱of˲_/the/_\nd Lord\nd* struck him, for that ˱he˲_> not <_gave the glory - ˱to˲_\nd God\nd*, and /having/_become worm-infested, ˱he˲_stopped_breathing.
\v 24 ¶ But the word ˱of˲_the ˱of˲_\nd God\nd* /was/_growing and /was_being/_multiplied.
\v 25 And Barnabas and Saul returned to Jerusalem, /having/_fulfilled the service, /having/_taken_along_with \add them\add* John, - /having_been/_called Mark.
\c 13
\v 1 ¶ And ˱there˲_were prophets and teachers in Antioch, in the assembly being: - jointly Barnabas, and Simeon who /being/_called Niger, and Lucius the Cyrenian, And Manaen raised_with ˱of˲_Herod ˱of˲_the tetrarch, and Saul.
\v 2 And ˱of˲_them ministering ˱to˲_the \nd Lord\nd* and fasting, the - Holy \nd Spirit\nd* said, “Indeed set_apart ˱to˲_me - Barnabas and Saul, for the work which ˱I˲_/have/_called_ them _to.”
\v 3 Then /having/_fasted, and /having/_prayed, and /having/_laid_on their hands ˱on˲_them, ˱they˲_sent_away \add them\add*.
\v 4 ¶ Therefore indeed ¶ They /having_been/_sent_out by - Holy \nd Spirit\nd*, came_down to Seleucia, and from_there ˱they˲_sailed_away to Cyprus.
\v 5 And /having/_become in Salamis, ˱they˲_/were/_proclaiming the word ˱of˲_the ˱of˲_\nd God\nd* in the synagogues ˱of˲_the Jews. And ˱they˲_/were/_=> also <=_having John, /an/_attendant.
\v 6 And /having/_passed_through all the island until Paphos, ˱they˲_found /a/_man, /a/_certain Jewish false_prophet magician, ˱to˲_whose name \add was\add* Barjesus,
\v 7 who was with the proconsul Sergius Paul, /a/_=> intelligent <=_man. He, /having/_called_to Barnabas and Saul, sought_after /to/_hear the word - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*.
\v 8 But Elymas the magician (for thus /is_being/_translated the name ˱of˲_him /was/_resisting ˱against˲_them) seeking /to/_pervert the proconsul from the faith.
\v 9 But Saul, the \add one\add* also \add called\add* Paul, /having_been/_filled ˱with˲_/the/_=> Holy <=_\nd Spirit\nd*, /having/_looked_intently at him
\v 10 said, “O son ˱of˲_/the/_devil full ˱of˲_all deceit and all fraud, enemy ˱of˲_all righteousness, not /will_˱you˲_/be_ceasing perverting the - straight ways ˱of˲_the \nd Lord\nd*?
\v 11 And now behold, /the/_hand ˱of˲_/the/_\nd Lord\nd* on you, and ˱you˲_will_be blind, not seeing the sun until /a/_season.” and immediately /a/_mist and darkness fell on him, and going_around ˱he˲_/was/_seeking one_leading_by_hand.
\v 12 Then the proconsul /having/_seen what /having/_become, ˱he˲_believed /being/_astonished at the teaching ˱of˲_the \nd Lord\nd*.
\v 13 ¶ And the \add ones\add* around \add him\add* Paul /having_been/_launched from - Paphos, came to Perga - ˱of˲_Pamphylia. But John /having/_went_away from them, ˱he˲_returned to Jerusalem.
\v 14 But they, /having/_passed_through from - Perga, arrived to Antioch - Pisidia, and /having/_come into the synagogue ˱on˲_the day ˱of˲_the Sabbaths, ˱they˲_sat_down.
\v 15 And after the public_reading ˱of˲_the law and ˱of˲_the prophets, the synagogue_leaders sent_out to them saying, “Men, brothers, if among you_all ˱there˲_is any word ˱of˲_exhortation toward the people, /be/_speaking \add it\add*.”
\v 16 And Paul /having/_stood_up, and /having/_gestured ˱with˲_his hand said, “Men, Israelites, and you_all revering - \nd God\nd*, hear \add me\add*.
\v 17 The \nd God\nd* ˱of˲_the people ˱of˲_this Israel chose the fathers ˱of˲_us, and exalted the people in the sojourn in /the/_land ˱of˲_Egypt, and with /his/_arm high, ˱he˲_led_out them out_of it,
\v 18 and /the/_time ˱he˲_sustained them in the desert about, forty_year,
\v 19 and /having/_taken_down seven nations in /the/_land ˱of˲_Canaan, ˱he˲_passed_down the land ˱of˲_them–
\v 20 about four_hundred years and fifty. And after these \add things\add*, ˱he˲_gave \add them\add* judges until Samuel /the/_prophet.
\v 21 And_from_there ˱they˲_requested /a/_king, and - \nd God\nd* gave ˱to˲_them - Saul, son ˱of˲_Kis, /a/_man of /the/_tribe ˱of˲_Benjamin, ˱for˲_> forty <_years.
\v 22 And /having/_removed him, ˱he˲_raised - David ˱to˲_them for /a/_king, ˱to˲_whom also ˱he˲_spoke /having/_testified, ‘“˱I˲_found David” the \add son\add* - ˱of˲_Jesse, “/a/_man according_to the heart ˱of˲_me”, who /will_be/_doing all the wills ˱of˲_me.’
\v 23 Of the seed ˱of˲_this \add one\add* - \nd God\nd* according_to promise, brought - ˱to˲_Israel /a/_Savior, \nd Jesus\nd*,
\v 24 ˱of˲_John /having/_publicly_proclaimed before /the/_face ˱of˲_the entrance ˱of˲_him, /a/_baptism ˱of˲_repentance ˱to˲_all the people ˱of˲_Israel.
\v 25 And while John /was/_fulfilling the course, ˱he˲_/was/_saying, ‘What ˱you_all˲_/are/_suspecting me to_be? I am_> not <_\add he\add*, but behold, ˱he˲_/is/_coming after me, ˱of˲_whom ˱I˲_am not worthy /to/_untie the sandal ˱of˲_his feet.’
\v 26 ¶ Men, brothers, sons ˱of˲_/the/_descent ˱of˲_Abraham, and you_all among you_all revering - \nd God\nd*, ˱to˲_us the word - ˱of˲_> this <_salvation /was/_sent_away.
\v 27 For the \add ones\add* dwelling in Jerusalem and the rulers ˱of˲_them, /having/_not_known this \add one\add* and the voices ˱of˲_the prophets, who /being/_read on every Sabbath, /having/_judged \add him\add* ˱they˲_fulfilled \add them\add*.
\v 28 And /having/_found not_one cause ˱for˲_death, ˱they˲_requested Pilate him /to_be/_killed.
\v 29 And when ˱they˲_finished all the \add things\add* /having_been/_written concerning him, /having/_taken_down \add him\add* from the cross, ˱they˲_put \add him\add* in /a/_tomb.
\v 30 But - \nd God\nd* raised him from /the/_dead;
\v 31 who /was/_seen for more days, ˱to˲_the \add ones\add* /having/_come_up_with him from - Galilee to Jerusalem, who are now witnesses ˱of˲_him to the people.
\v 32 And we /are/_gospel_preaching ˱to˲_you_all the the promise /having/_become to fathers,

\v 34 And that raised_ him _up from /the/_dead, no_longer going /to_be/_returning to decay, thus ˱he˲_/has/_said, - ‘˱I˲_/will_be/_giving ˱to˲_you_all the devout - faithful ˱of˲_David.’
\v 35 Therefore also in another \add psalm\add* ˱he˲_/is/_saying, ‘˱you˲_/will_ not _be/_giving the Devout \add One\add* ˱of˲_you /to/_see decay.’
\v 36 For on_one_hand David /having/_attended ˱to˲_the - counsel ˱of˲_\nd God\nd* ˱to˲_/his/_own generation, /was/_fallen_asleep and /was/_added to the fathers ˱of˲_him, and saw decay.
\v 37 On_the_other_hand which \add one\add* - \nd God\nd* raised not saw decay.
\v 38 Therefore ˱it˲_let_be known, ˱to˲_you_all, men, brothers, that through this \add one\add*, forgiveness ˱of˲_sins /is_being/_proclaimed ˱to˲_you_all, from all \add things\add* ˱of˲_which ˱you_all˲_/were/_=> not <=_able /to_be/_justified in /the/_law ˱of˲_Moses,
\v 39 everyone - believing in this \add one\add* /is_being/_justified.
\v 40 Therefore /be/_watching_out, lest the \add word\add* /having_been/_said in the prophets /may/_come_over:
\v 41 ‘watch, you scoffers, and wonder and /be/_perishing, because I /am/_doing /a/_work in the days ˱of˲_you_all, /a/_work which by_no_means ˱you_all˲_/may/_=> not <=_believe, if someone /may_be/_describing_in_detail \add it\add* ˱to˲_you_all.’”
\v 42 ¶ And ˱of˲_them departing, ˱they˲_/were/_imploring these - words /to_be/_spoken ˱to˲_them on the afterward Sabbath.
\v 43 And /having_been/_released ˱of˲_the synagogue, many ˱of˲_the Jews and ˱of˲_the worshipping converts followed - ˱after˲_Paul and - Barnabas, who addressing ˱to˲_them, /were/_persuading them /to_be/_remaining ˱in˲_the grace - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*.
\v 44 And ˱on˲_the coming Sabbath, almost all the city /was/_gathered_together /to/_hear the word - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*.
\v 45 But the Jews /having/_seen the crowds, ˱they˲_/were/_filled ˱with˲_jealousy and ˱they˲_/were/_speaking_against ˱against˲_the_> slandering <_\add things\add* /being/_spoken by Paul.
\v 46 and, - Paul and - Barnabas /Having/_spoken_boldly said, ˱it˲_was necessary the word - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd* first /to_be/_spoken “˱To˲_you_all. Since and ˱you_all˲_/are/_pushing_ it _away, and not worthy ˱you_all˲_/are/_judging yourselves - ˱of˲_eternal life, behold, ˱we˲_/are_being/_turned to the pagans.
\v 47 For thus the \nd Lord\nd* /has/_commanded ˱to˲_us, ‘˱I˲_/have/_set you for /a/_light ˱of˲_/the/_pagans, - you to_be for salvation to /the/_last ˱of˲_the earth.’”
\v 48 And hearing \add it\add* the pagans, ˱they˲_/were/_rejoicing and /were/_glorifying the word ˱of˲_the \nd Lord\nd*, and as_many_as were /having_been/_appointed to eternal life believed.
\v 49 And the word ˱of˲_the \nd Lord\nd* /was_being/_carried_through through all the region.
\v 50 But the Jews incited the - prominent worshipping women, and the leaders ˱of˲_the city, and ˱they˲_stirred_up /a/_persecution against - Paul and Barnabas, and ˱they˲_cast_ them _out from the regions ˱of˲_them.
\v 51 But they, /having/_shaken_off the dust ˱of˲_the feet against them, came to Iconium.
\v 52 And the disciples /were_being/_filled ˱with˲_joy and /the/_=> Holy <=_\nd Spirit\nd*.
\c 14
\v 1 ¶ And ˱it˲_became, in Iconium with the same them /to/_come_in into the synagogue ˱of˲_the Jews, and /to/_speak thus so_that /a/_great multitude ˱of˲_> both <_Jews and Greeks /to/_believe.
\v 2 But the Jews /having/_disbelieved stirred_up and mistreated the hearts ˱of˲_the pagans against the brothers.
\v 3 Therefore on_one_hand ˱they˲_stayed much time, speaking_boldly for the \nd Lord\nd*, the \add one\add* testifying the word ˱of˲_the grace ˱of˲_him, ˱to˲_giving signs and wonders /to_be/_becoming through the hands ˱of˲_them.
\v 4 On_the_other_hand the multitude ˱of˲_the city /was/_divided, and on_one_hand they were with the Jews, on_the_other_hand they with the ambassadors.
\v 5 And when /an/_impulse both ˱of˲_the pagans and Jews with the rulers ˱of˲_them became, /to/_mistreat and /to/_throw_stones ˱at˲_them,
\v 6 /having/_become_aware_of, ˱they˲_fled_down to the cities - ˱of˲_Lycaonia, Lystra, and Derbe, and the surrounding_region,
\v 7 and_there ˱they˲_were gospel_preaching.
\v 8 ¶ And /a/_certain man, in Lystra powerless ˱by˲_the feet, who never walked /was/_sitting lame from /the/_womb ˱of˲_/the/_mother ˱of˲_him.
\v 9 This \add man\add* /was/_hearing - ˱of˲_Paul speaking, who /having/_looked_intently ˱at˲_him and /having/_seen that ˱he˲_/is/_having faith - /to_be/_healed,
\v 10 said ˱with˲_/a/_loud voice, “Stand_up straight on the feet ˱of˲_you!” And ˱he˲_sprang_up and /was/_walking.
\v 11 And the crowds /having/_seen what Paul did, lifted_up the voice ˱of˲_them In_Lycaonian saying, “The gods /having_been/_likened ˱to˲_men, came_down to us.”
\v 12 ˱They˲_/were/_calling both - Barnabas, “Zeus”, and - Paul, “Hermas”, since he was the \add one\add* leading ˱of˲_the matter.
\v 13 And the /the/_priest - ˱of˲_Zeus, - being before the city, /having/_brought bulls and garlands to the gates, ˱he˲_/was/_wanting /to_be/_sacrificing with the crowds.
\v 14 But the ambassadors Barnabas and Paul /having/_heard, /having/_torn the robes ˱of˲_themselves, ˱they˲_rushed_out into the crowd, crying_out
\v 15 and saying, “Men, why /are/_˱you_all˲_doing these \add things\add*? We also are humans like_natured ˱with˲_you_all, evangelizing you_all /to_be/_turning_back from these - useless \add things\add* to living \nd God\nd*, ‘who made the heaven, and the earth, and the sea, and all the \add things\add* in them’.
\v 16 Who in the generations /having/_gone_by, allowed all the nations /to_be/_going ˱to˲_the ways ˱of˲_them.
\v 17 And_yet left himself not without_witness, working_good from_heaven ˱to˲_you_all giving rains and fruitful seasons, filling ˱with˲_food and the hearts ˱of˲_you_all gladness.”
\v 18 And saying these \add things\add*, with_difficulty ˱they˲_restrained the crowds - not /to_be/_sacrificing ˱to˲_them.
\v 19 ¶ But Jews ¶ Came_over from Antioch and Iconium, and /having/_persuaded the crowds, and /having/_stoned - Paul, ˱they˲_/were/_dragging \add him\add* outside the city, thinking him /to_have/_died.
\v 20 But ˱of˲_the disciples /having/_surrounded him, /having/_stood_up ˱he˲_came_in into the city. And ˱on˲_the \add day\add* of_next ˱he˲_came_out with - Barnabas to Derbe.
\v 21 ¶ And /having/_gospel_preached - that city, and /having/_discipled many, ˱they˲_returned to - Lystra, and to Iconium, and to Antioch,
\v 22 strengthening the souls ˱of˲_the disciples, exhorting \add them\add* /to_be/_remaining_in ˱in˲_the faith, and that ˱it˲_/is/_fitting us /to/_come_in into the Kingdom - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd* through many tribulations.
\v 23 And /having/_chosen elders ˱for˲_them in assembly, /having/_prayed with fastings, ˱they˲_entrusted them ˱to˲_the \nd Lord\nd* on whom ˱they˲_/had/_believed.
\v 24 And /having/_passed_through - Pisidia, ˱they˲_came to - Pamphylia,
\v 25 and /having/_spoken the word ˱of˲_the \nd Lord\nd* in Perga, ˱they˲_came_down to Attalia,
\v 26 and_from_there ˱they˲_sailed_away to Antioch, whence ˱they˲_were /having_been/_given_over ˱to˲_the grace - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*, for the work that ˱they˲_fulfilled.
\v 27 And /having/_arrived and /having/_gathered_together the assembly, ˱they˲_/were/_declaring as_much_as - \nd God\nd* did with them, and that ˱he˲_opened_up /a/_door ˱of˲_faith ˱to˲_the pagans.
\v 28 And ˱they˲_/were/_staying no little time with the disciples.
\c 15
\v 1 ¶ And some /having/_come_down from - Judea, /were/_teaching the brothers, - “If ˱you_all˲_/may_ not _be/_circumcised ˱to˲_the custom - ˱of˲_Moses, ˱you_all˲_/are/_=> not <=_being_able /to_be/_saved.”
\v 2 And dissension and no little debate /having/_become - ˱by˲_Paul and - Barnabas with them, ˱they˲_determined Paul and Barnabas and some others from them /to_be/_going_up, to the ambassadors and elders in Jerusalem about - this question.
\v 3 therefore indeed The /having_been/_sent_forward by the assembly, ˱they˲_/were/_passing_through - both Phoenicia and Samaria, describing_in_detail the conversion ˱of˲_the pagans, and ˱they˲_/were/_producing great joy ˱to˲_all the brothers.
\v 4 And /having/_arrived in Jerusalem, ˱they˲_/were/_accepted by the assembly, and the ambassadors, and the elders, and ˱they˲_declared as_much_as - \nd God\nd* did with them.
\v 5 But some ˱of˲_the \add ones\add* of the sect ˱of˲_the Pharisees /having/_believed rose_up, saying, - “˱It˲_/is/_fitting /to_be/_circumcising them, and /to_be/_commanding \add them\add* /to_be/_keeping the law ˱of˲_Moses.”
\v 6 And the ambassadors and the elders /were/_gathered_together, /to/_see about - this matter.
\v 7 And /having/_become much debate, Peter /having/_stood_up said to them, “Men, brothers, you_all /are/_knowing that from ancient days among you_all, - \nd God\nd* chose ˱for˲_the pagans /to/_hear by the mouth ˱of˲_me, the word ˱of˲_the gospel and /to/_believe.
\v 8 And \nd God\nd* the heart_knower testified ˱to˲_them, /having/_given \add them\add* the - Holy \nd Spirit\nd* as also ˱to˲_us,
\v 9 and ˱he˲_distinguished nothing between both us and them, /having/_purified the hearts ˱of˲_them ˱by˲_the faith.
\v 10 Therefore now why /are/_˱you_all˲_testing - \nd God\nd*, /to/_put_on /a/_yoke on the neck ˱of˲_the disciples, that neither the fathers ˱of˲_us nor we were_able /to/_bear?
\v 11 But by the grace ˱of˲_the /the/_\nd Lord\nd* \nd Jesus\nd*, ˱we˲_/are/_believing /to_be/_saved also_those in which manner.”
\v 12 ¶ And ¶ all the multitude kept_silent, and ˱they˲_/were/_hearing ˱from˲_Barnabas and Paul, explaining as_much_as - \nd God\nd* did, signs and wonders among the pagans by them.
\v 13 And after - them /to/_keep_silent, Jacobus answered saying, “Men, brothers, hear ˱from˲_me.
\v 14 Simeon explained as first - \nd God\nd* visited, /to/_take out_of /the/_pagans /a/_people ˱for˲_the name ˱of˲_him.
\v 15 And ˱with˲_this /are/_agreeing_together the words ˱of˲_the prophets as ˱it˲_/has_been/_written,
\v 16 ‘“After these \add things\add* ˱I˲_/will_be/_returning and ˱I˲_/will_be/_rebuilding_up the tabernacle ˱of˲_David which /having/_fallen, and ˱of˲_it - /having_been/_overturned, ˱I˲_/will_be/_rebuilding_up and ˱I˲_/will_be/_restoring it,
\v 17 so_that - the remnant ˱of˲_the people /may/_seek_out the \nd Lord\nd*, also all the pagans, on whom /has_been/_called the name ˱of˲_me on them”, /is/_saying /the/_\nd Lord\nd* doing these \add things\add*’,
\v 18 known from eternity.
\v 19 Therefore I /am/_judging /to_ not _be/_troubling ˱to˲_the \add ones\add* from the pagans, turning_back to - \nd God\nd*,
\v 20 but /to/_write ˱to˲_them - /to_be/_keeping_away ˱from˲_the pollutions - ˱of˲_idols, and - sexual_immorality, and the strangled \add animal\add*, and - blood.
\v 21 For Moses from ancient generations in_every city the \add ones\add* proclaiming him, /is/_having /being/_read in the synagogues on every Sabbath.”
\v 22 ¶ Then ˱it˲_supposed ˱to˲_the ambassadors and the elders with all the assembly, /having/_chosen men from them, /to/_send \add them\add* to Antioch with - Paul and Barnabas– Judas - /being/_called Barsabbas and Silas, leading men among the brothers,
\v 23 /having/_written by /the/_hand ˱of˲_them, “the ambassadors and the elders, brothers, /to_be/_greeting ˱to˲_the \add ones\add* in - Antioch, and Syria, and Cilicia, brothers - from /the/_pagans.
\v 24 Since ˱we˲_heard that some from us ˱to˲_whom ˱we˲_> not <_instructed /having/_come_out, disturbed you_all ˱by˲_> upsetting <_words the hearts ˱of˲_you_all,
\v 25 ˱it˲_supposed ˱to˲_us /having/_become with_one_accord, /having/_chosen men /to/_send to you_all, with Barnabas and Paul the beloved ˱of˲_us,
\v 26 men /having/_given_over the lives ˱of˲_them for the name ˱of˲_the \nd Lord\nd* ˱of˲_us, \nd Jesus\nd* \nd Christ\nd*.
\v 27 Therefore ˱we˲_/have/_sent_out Judas and Silas, and them reporting the same \add things\add* by word.
\v 28 For ˱it˲_supposed ˱to˲_the - Holy \nd Spirit\nd* and ˱to˲_us, nothing more burden /to_be_being/_laid_on ˱on˲_you_all, except - necessarily these \add things\add*:
\v 29 /to_be/_keeping_away ˱from˲_idol_sacrificed \add things\add*, and ˱from˲_blood, and ˱from˲_strangled \add animals\add*, and ˱from˲_sexual_immorality; from which keeping yourselves, ˱you_all˲_/will_be/_doing well. Farewell!”
\v 30 ¶ Therefore indeed they /having_been/_sent_away, came_down to Antioch, and /having/_gathered_together the multitude, ˱they˲_handed_out the letter.
\v 31 And /having/_read \add it\add*, ˱they˲_/were/_elated at the exhortation.
\v 32 Both Judas and Silas, also themselves being prophets, by much speech, exhorted the brothers and ˱they˲_strengthened \add them\add*.
\v 33 And /having/_made \add some\add* time \add there\add*, ˱they˲_/were/_sent_away with peace from the brothers, to the \add ones\add* /having/_sent_ them _out.
\v 34
\v 35 But Paul and Barnabas /were/_staying in Antioch, teaching and gospel_preaching the word ˱of˲_the \nd Lord\nd* with many others also.
\v 36 ¶ And after some days, Paul said to Barnabas, indeed /having/_turned_back ˱we˲_/may/_visit the brothers in every city, in which ˱we˲_proclaimed the word ˱of˲_the \nd Lord\nd*, how ˱they˲_/are/_having.”
\v 37 And Barnabas /was/_wishing /to/_take_along_with \add them\add* also - John, - /being/_called Mark.
\v 38 But Paul /was/_considering_worthy \add it\add* the \add one\add* /having/_withdrawn from them from Pamphylia and not /having/_come_together ˱with˲_them to the work, not /to_be/_taking_along_with \add him\add* this \add one\add*.
\v 39 And /a/_provocation became, so_as them /to_be/_separated from one_another, and - Barnabas /having/_taken - Mark, /to/_sail_away to Cyprus.
\v 40 But Paul /having/_chosen Silas, came_out /having_been/_given_over ˱to˲_the grace ˱of˲_the \nd Lord\nd* by the brothers.
\v 41 And ˱he˲_/was/_passing_through - Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the assemblies.
\c 16
\v 1 ¶ And ˱he˲_arrived also to Derbe and to Lystra. And behold, /a/_=> certain <=_disciple was there ˱by˲_/the/_name Timothy, /the/_son ˱of˲_/a/_=> believing <=_woman Jewish, but /his/_father \add was\add* ˱of˲_/a/_Greek,
\v 2 who /was_being/_attested by the brothers in Lystra and Iconium.
\v 3 - Paul wanted this \add one\add* /to/_come_out with him, and /having/_taken ˱he˲_circumcised him, because_of the Jews - being in - those places, for all /had/_known that the father ˱of˲_him ˱he˲_/was/_being /a/_Greek.
\v 4 And while ˱they˲_/were/_passing_through the cities, ˱they˲_/were/_giving_over ˱to˲_them the decrees /to_be/_keeping - /having_been/_judged by ˱of˲_the ambassadors and elders - in Jerusalem.
\v 5 Therefore indeed the assemblies /were_being/_strengthened ˱in˲_the faith, and ˱they˲_/were/_abounding - ˱in˲_number in_every day.
\v 6 ¶ And ˱they˲_passed_through - Phrygia and /the/_Galatian region, /having_been/_forbidden by the Holy \nd Spirit\nd* /to/_speak the word in - Asia,
\v 7 and /having/_come down - ˱to˲_Mysia, ˱they˲_/were/_attempting /to_be/_gone into - Bithynia, and the \nd Spirit\nd* ˱of˲_\nd Jesus\nd* not allowed them;
\v 8 and /having/_passed_by - Mysia, ˱they˲_came_down to Troas.
\v 9 And through /the/_night /a/_vision /was/_seen - ˱to˲_Paul, /a/_=> Certain Macedonian <=_man was /having/_stood and imploring him and saying, “/Having/_passed_through into Macedonia, give_help ˱to˲_us.”
\v 10 And when ˱he˲_saw the vision, immediately ˱we˲_sought /to/_come_out to Macedonia, concluding that - \nd God\nd* /has/_called_to us /to/_evangelize them.
\v 11 therefore /having_been/_launched from Troas, ˱we˲_ran_straight to Samothrace, and ˱on˲_the_> following <_\add day\add* to New City,
\v 12 and_from_there to Philippi, which is /the/_leading city ˱of˲_the district ˱of˲_Macedonia, /a/_colony. And ˱we˲_were staying in this - city some days.
\v 13 And ˱on˲_the day ˱of˲_the Sabbaths, ˱we˲_came_out outside the gate by /a/_river, where ˱we˲_/were/_thinking prayer to_be, and /having/_sat_down ˱we˲_/were/_speaking ˱to˲_the women /having/_come_together.
\v 14 And /a/_certain woman ˱by˲_/the/_name Lydia, /a/_seller_of_purple ˱of˲_/the/_city ˱of˲_Thyatira, worshipping - \nd God\nd* /was/_hearing, ˱of˲_whom the \nd Lord\nd* opened_up her heart, /to_be/_taking_heed ˱to˲_the \add things\add* /being/_spoken by - Paul.
\v 15 And when ˱she˲_/was/_baptized and the house ˱of˲_her, ˱she˲_implored saying, “If ˱you_all˲_/have/_judged me to_be faithful ˱to˲_the \nd Lord\nd*, /having/_come_in into the house ˱of˲_me, /be/_remaining.” And ˱she˲_urged us.
\v 16 ¶ And ˱it˲_became, ˱of˲_us going to the prayer \add place\add*, /a/_=> certain <=_servant_girl having /a/_=> Python <=_spirit, /to/_meet ˱with˲_us, who fortune-telling /was/_bringing_about much business ˱for˲_the masters ˱of˲_her.
\v 17 This \add woman\add* following - ˱after˲_Paul and /was/_crying_out ˱to˲_us saying, “These - men are slaves - ˱of˲_> The Highest <_\nd God\nd*, who /are/_proclaiming ˱to˲_you_all /the/_way ˱of˲_salvation.”
\v 18 And ˱she˲_/was/_doing this for many days. But Paul /having_been/_thoroughly_disturbed, and /having/_turned_back ˱by˲_the Spirit said, “˱I˲_/am/_commanding ˱to˲_you in /the/_name ˱of˲_\nd Jesus\nd* \nd Christ\nd* /to/_come_out from her.” And ˱it˲_came_out ˱to˲_> the <_same hour.
\v 19 ¶ But the masters ˱of˲_her /having/_seen that the hope ˱of˲_the business ˱of˲_them, going_out, /having/_taken_hold_of - Paul and - Silas, ˱they˲_dragged \add them\add* into the marketplace before the rulers,
\v 20 and /having/_brought_ them _forward ˱to˲_the officers, ˱they˲_said, “These - men being Jews /are/_disturbing the city ˱of˲_us,
\v 21 and ˱they˲_/are/_proclaiming customs that ˱it˲_/is/_=> not <=_permitting ˱for˲_us /to_be/_accepting nor /to_be/_practicing, being Romans.”
\v 22 And the /a/_crowd rose_up_together against them, and the officers /having/_torn_off ˱of˲_them the robes, /were/_commanding /to_be/_beating_with_rods \add them\add*.
\v 23 And /having/_inflicted many blows ˱on˲_them, ˱they˲_cast \add them\add* into prison, /having/_commanded ˱to˲_the prison_guard /to_be/_keeping them securely;
\v 24 who /having/_received such charge, cast them into the inner prison, and secured their feet ˱of˲_them in the stocks.
\v 25 ¶ But to - midnight, Paul and Silas praying, /were/_singing_hymns - ˱to˲_\nd God\nd*, and the prisoners /were/_listening ˱to˲_them.
\v 26 And suddenly /an/_=> great <=_earthquake became, so_that the foundations ˱of˲_the prison /to_be/_shaken, and immediately all the doors /were/_opened_up, and the bonds ˱of˲_all /was/_unfastened.
\v 27 And the prison_guard /having/_become awoken, and /having/_seen the doors ˱of˲_the prison /having_been/_opened_up, /having/_drawn his sword ˱he˲_/was/_going /to_be/_killing himself, thinking the prisoners /to_have/_escaped.
\v 28 But Paul called ˱with˲_/a/_=> loud <=_voice saying, “˱You˲_/may/_do nothing harm ˱to˲_yourself, for ˱we˲_are all here.”
\v 29 And /having/_requested lights, ˱he˲_rushed_in, and /having/_become trembling, ˱he˲_fell_before - ˱to˲_Paul and Silas.
\v 30 And /having/_brought_ them _forth out /was/_saying, “Sirs, what /is/_fitting me /to_be/_doing, in_order_that ˱I˲_/may_be/_saved?”
\v 31 And they said, “Believe in the \nd Lord\nd* \nd Jesus\nd* and ˱you˲_/will_be_being/_saved, you and the household ˱of˲_you.”
\v 32 And ˱they˲_spoke the word ˱of˲_the \nd Lord\nd* ˱to˲_him, with all the \add ones\add* in the house ˱of˲_him.
\v 33 And /having/_taken them in that - hour ˱of˲_the night, ˱he˲_washed \add them\add* from their wounds, and ˱he˲_/was/_baptized, he and the \add ones\add* ˱of˲_him all immediately.
\v 34 And /having/_brought_ them _up into the house, ˱he˲_set_before /a/_table \add for_them\add* and exulted with_all_the_household, /having/_believed - ˱in˲_\nd God\nd*.
\v 35 ¶ And /having/_become day, the officers sent_out the policemen saying, “Send_away - those men.”
\v 36 And the prison_guard reported the words to - Paul: - “The officers “/Have/_sent_out, in_order_that ˱you_all˲_/may_be/_sent_away. Therefore now /having/_come_out, /be/_going in peace.”
\v 37 But - Paul /was/_saying to them, “/Having/_beat us ˱with˲_publicly, uncondemned men being Romans, ˱they˲_cast \add us\add* into prison and now secretly ˱they˲_/are/_casting_ us _out? For no, but /having/_come themselves, ˱them˲_/let/_lead_ us _out.”
\v 38 And the policemen reported - these words ˱to˲_the officers. And ˱they˲_/were/_afraid /having/_heard that ˱they˲_are Romans.
\v 39 And /having/_come, ˱they˲_appealed ˱to˲_them, and /having/_led_out \add them\add*, ˱they˲_/were/_asking \add them\add* /to/_go_away From the city.
\v 40 And /having/_come_out from the prison, ˱they˲_came_in to - Lydia, and /having/_seen \add them\add*, ˱they˲_exhorted the brothers and ˱they˲_came_out.

\v 1 ¶ And /having/_traveled_through the Amphipolis and - Apollonia, ˱they˲_came to Thessalonica, where was /a/_synagogue ˱of˲_the Jews.
\v 2 And according_to the \add way\add* /having/_been_accustomed - ˱with˲_Paul, ˱he˲_came_in to them, and for Three Sabbaths, ˱he˲_discussed ˱with˲_them from the Scriptures,
\v 3 opening_up and setting_before that ˱it˲_/was/_fitting the \nd Messiah\nd* /to/_suffer, and /to/_rise_up from /the/_dead, and \add saying\add* - “This \nd Jesus\nd*, whom I /am/_proclaiming ˱to˲_you_all is.” \nd Messiah\nd*.”
\v 4 And some of them /were/_persuaded and ˱they˲_/were/_joined - ˱with˲_Paul and - Silas, both /a/_=> great <=_multitude ˱of˲_the \add ones\add* Greeks worshipping, and leading /a/_few women the not.
\v 5 But the Jews, /having/_been_jealous and /having/_taken_aside some evil men ˱of˲_the marketplaces, and /having/_formed_a_mob, ˱they˲_/were/_distressing the city, and /having/_approached ˱to˲_the house ˱of˲_Jason, ˱they˲_/were/_seeking them /to/_bring_forth to the public.
\v 6 And not /having/_found them, ˱they˲_/were/_dragging Jason and some brothers before the city_council shouting, - “The \add ones\add* /having/_upset the inhabited_world, these /are/_coming here also,
\v 7 whom Jason /has/_welcomed; and these all /are/_doing in_front_of the decrees ˱of˲_Caesar, saying \nd Jesus\nd* another king to_be.”
\v 8 And ˱they˲_disturbed the crowd and the city_council hearing these \add things\add*.
\v 9 And /having/_taken - much from - Jason and the rest, ˱they˲_sent_ them _away.
\v 10 ¶ And the brothers immediately sent_out - both Paul and - Silas by night to Berea, who /having/_arrived, /were/_going into the synagogue ˱of˲_the Jews.
\v 11 And these were more_noble \add than\add* the \add ones\add* in Thessalonica, who received the word with all readiness, in_every day examining the Scriptures, if these \add things\add* /might_be/_having thus.
\v 12 therefore indeed Many from them believed, and not /a/_few ˱of˲_the - prominent Greek women, and men.
\v 13 But when the Jews from - Thessalonica knew that also the word - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd* /was/_proclaimed by - Paul in, - Berea, ˱they˲_came also_there, agitating and disturbing the crowds.
\v 14 And then the brothers immediately - Paul sent_away, /to_be/_going as_far_as to the sea; and - both Silas and - Timothy remained there.
\v 15 And the \add ones\add* appointing - Paul, brought \add him\add* to Athens, and /having/_received /a/_commandment for - Silas and - Timothy, that as ˱they˲_/may/_come most_quickly to him, ˱they˲_/were/_departing.
\v 16 ¶ And - Paul in - Athens, ˱of˲_awaiting them, the spirit ˱of˲_him /was_being/_provoked in him, ˱of˲_observing the city being idolatrous.
\v 17 Therefore ˱he˲_/was/_discussing on_one_hand in the synagogue ˱with˲_the Jews, and the \add ones\add* worshipping, and in the marketplace on every day with the \add ones\add* happening_to_be.
\v 18 On_the_other_hand some also ˱of˲_the Epicureans and Stoic philosophers /were/_conferring ˱with˲_him, and some /were/_saying, “What - /might_ this - _be/_wanting babbler /to_be/_saying?” But the \add others\add*, “˱He˲_/is/_supposing to_be /a/_proclaimer ˱of˲_strange demons”; because ˱he˲_/was/_gospel_preaching - \nd Jesus\nd* and the resurrection.
\v 19 and /having/_taken_hold ˱of˲_him, ˱they˲_brought \add him\add* to the Aries Hill saying, “/Are/_˱we˲_being_able /to/_know what \add is\add* - this new, teaching \add is\add* /being/_spoken by you?
\v 20 For ˱you˲_/are/_carrying_in some_> surprising <_\add words\add* to the ears ˱of˲_us. Therefore ˱we˲_/are/_wishing /to/_know what_all /is/_wanting these \add things\add* to_be.”
\v 21 (And all /the/_Athenians and the visiting strangers /were/_having_opportunity in not_one other \add thing\add*, than /to_be/_telling something or /to_be/_hearing some newer \add thing\add*.)
\v 22 ¶ And Paul /having_been/_stood in /the/_midst ˱of˲_the Aries Hill /was/_saying, “Men, Athenians, ˱I˲_/am/_perceiving in all \add things\add* how more_superstitious you_all.
\v 23 For passing_through and observing the objects_of_worship ˱of˲_you_all, ˱I˲_> even <_found /an/_altar on which /had_been/_inscribed, ‘˱to˲_/an/_unknown \nd God\nd*.’ Therefore ˱you_all˲_/are/_being_devout not_knowing which, this \add thing\add* I /am/_proclaiming ˱to˲_you_all.
\v 24 The \nd God\nd* - /having/_made the earth and all the \add things\add* in it, this \add one\add* being \nd Lord\nd* ˱of˲_heaven and earth, /is/_dwelling neither in handmade temples,
\v 25 nor /is_being/_healed by human hands, additionally_needing ˱of˲_anything, he giving life, and breath, and the_> all <_\add things\add* ˱to˲_all;
\v 26 and ˱he˲_made of one, every nation ˱of˲_mankind /to_be/_dwelling on all /the/_face ˱of˲_the earth, /having/_designated \add the\add* /having_been/_commanded times and the boundaries ˱of˲_the dwelling_place ˱of˲_them,
\v 27 /to_be/_seeking - \nd God\nd*, if perhaps surely ˱they˲_/might/_grope ˱for˲_him and /might/_find \add him\add*, also surely being not far from one each ˱of˲_us.
\v 28 For ˱we˲_/are/_living in him and /are_being/_moved and are, as also some ˱of˲_the among you_all ˱of˲_/the/_poets /have/_said, ‘for ‘˱we˲_are also ˱of˲_the \add one\add* descent.’
\v 29 Therefore being descent - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*, ˱we˲_ought not /to_be/_thinking ˱about˲_gold or silver or /a/_stone mark ˱of˲_/the/_craft and thoughts ˱of˲_human_origin, to_be similar the divine.
\v 30 Therefore indeed - \nd God\nd* the times - ˱of˲_ignorance /having/_overlooked, now ˱he˲_/is/_reporting the \add things\add* ˱to˲_> all <_the people everywhere /to_be/_repenting,
\v 31 as_much_as ˱he˲_set /a/_day in which ˱he˲_/is/_going /to_be/_judging the inhabited_world in righteousness, by /a/_man ˱to˲_whom ˱he˲_designated, /having/_brought_about faith ˱to˲_all, /having/_raised_ him _up from /the/_dead.”
\v 32 ¶ And /having/_heard \add about\add* /a/_resurrection ˱of˲_/the/_dead, on_one_hand they /were/_mocking, on_the_other_hand they said, “˱We˲_/will_be/_hearing ˱from˲_you concerning this also again.”
\v 33 Thus - Paul came_out from /the/_midst ˱of˲_them.
\v 34 But some men /having_been/_joined_together ˱to˲_him, believed among whom both Dionysius the Areopagite, and /a/_woman ˱by˲_/the/_name Damaris, and others with them.
\c 18
\v 1 ¶ After these \add things\add*, /having_been/_departed from - Athens, ˱he˲_came to Corinth.
\v 2 And /having/_found /a/_certain Jew ˱by˲_/the/_name Aquila, ˱of˲_Pontus - ˱by˲_descent, recently /having/_come from - Italy, and Priscilla wife ˱of˲_him, because_of the \add thing\add* Claudius /to_have/_directed all the Jews /to_be_being/_departed from - Rome, ˱he˲_approached ˱to˲_them,
\v 3 and because_of to_be the same_trade, ˱he˲_/was/_remaining with them and ˱they˲_/were/_working, for ˱they˲_were tent_makers - ˱by˲_craft.
\v 4 And ˱he˲_/was/_discussing in the synagogue on every Sabbath, ˱he˲_/was/_persuading both Jews and Greeks.
\v 5 ¶ But ¶ when - both Silas and - Timothy, came_down from - Macedonia, - Paul /was_being/_occupied ˱with˲_the word, testifying ˱to˲_the Jews, \nd Jesus\nd* to_be the \nd Messiah\nd*.
\v 6 And opposing, them and slandering, /having/_shaken_off his clothes, ˱he˲_said to them, “The blood ˱of˲_you_all \add be\add* on the head ˱of˲_you_all; I \add am\add* clean. From the \add time\add* now, ˱I˲_/will_be/_going to the pagans.”
\v 7 And /having/_departed from_there, ˱he˲_came_in to /the/_house ˱of˲_someone ˱by˲_/the/_name ˱of˲_Titus Justus, worshipping - \nd God\nd*, ˱of˲_whom the house was being_next ˱to˲_the synagogue.
\v 8 And Crispus the synagogue_leader, believed ˱in˲_the \nd Lord\nd* with all the household ˱of˲_him, and many ˱of˲_the Corinthians hearing, /were/_believing and /were_being/_baptized.
\v 9 And the \nd Lord\nd* said in /the/_night by /a/_vision - ˱to˲_Paul, “/Be/_=> not <=_fearing, but /be/_speaking and not ˱you˲_/may/_keep_silent,
\v 10 because I am with you, and no_one /will_be/_inflicting ˱on˲_you - /to/_mistreat you, because ˱there˲_is many people ˱to˲_me in - this city.”
\v 11 and ˱he˲_sat_down /a/_year and six months, teaching the word - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd* among them.
\v 12 But Gallio being proconsul - ˱of˲_Achaia, the Jews stood_against with_one_accord - ˱against˲_Paul, and ˱they˲_led him to the tribunal
\v 13 saying, - “Contrary_to the law, this \add man\add* /is/_persuading, - people /to_be/_worshipping - \nd God\nd*.”
\v 14 But - Paul going /to_be/_opening_up his mouth, - Gallio said to the Jews, “If on_one_hand ˱it˲_was /a/_certain wrong or evil crime, O Jews, according_to /the/_matter - ˱I˲_had_tolerated ˱of˲_you_all;
\v 15 on_the_other_hand if ˱it˲_is questions about /a/_word, and names, and law, which \add is\add* among you_all, ˱you_all˲_/will_be/_seeing \add to_it\add* yourselves; I /am/_=> not <=_wishing to_be /a/_judge ˱of˲_these \add things\add*.”
\v 16 And ˱he˲_drove_ them _away from the tribunal.
\v 17 And all /having/_taken_hold_of Sosthenes the synagogue_leader, ˱they˲_/were/_striking \add him\add* before the tribunal. But nothing ˱of˲_these \add things\add* /was/_caring - ˱to˲_Gallio.
\v 18 ¶ And - Paul /having/_remained many days still, /having/_bid_goodbye ˱to˲_the brothers, /was/_sailing_away to - Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila, /having/_shaved his head in Cenchrea, for ˱he˲_/was/_having /a/_vow.
\v 19 And ˱they˲_arrived to Ephesus, and_ ˱he˲_left _those there, and himself /having/_come_in into the synagogue, ˱he˲_discussed ˱with˲_the Jews.
\v 20 And them asking \add him\add* for more time /to/_remain, ˱he˲_> not <_consented,
\v 21 but /having/_bid_goodbye and /having/_said, ˱I˲_/will_be/_returning to you_all “Again, - \nd God\nd* willing”, ˱he˲_/was/_launched from - Ephesus.
\v 22 And /having/_come_down to Caesarea, /having/_gone_up and /having/_greeted the assembly, ˱he˲_came_down to Antioch.
\v 23 And /having/_worked /a/_certain time, ˱he˲_came_out passing_through consecutively the Galatian region and Phrygia, strengthening all the disciples.
\v 24 ¶ And /a/_=> certain <=_Jew ˱by˲_/the/_name Apollos Alexandrian - ˱by˲_descent, /a/_scholarly man, arrived to Ephesus, being powerful in the Scriptures.
\v 25 This \add one\add* was /having_been/_instructed the way ˱of˲_the \nd Lord\nd*, and being_zealous - ˱in˲_spirit, ˱he˲_/was/_speaking and /was/_teaching exactly the \add things\add* concerning - \nd Jesus\nd*, knowing only the baptism ˱of˲_John.
\v 26 And this \add one\add* began /to_be/_speaking_boldly in the synagogue. But /having/_heard ˱from˲_him, Priscilla and Aquila took_ him _aside, and ˱they˲_explained the way - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd* more_exactly ˱to˲_him.
\v 27 And ˱about˲_him wishing /to/_pass_through into - Achaia, the brothers /having/_encouraged \add him\add*, wrote ˱to˲_the disciples /to/_welcome him, who /having/_arrived, contributed much ˱to˲_the \add ones\add* /having/_believed through - grace.
\v 28 For vigorously ˱he˲_/was/_thoroughly_refuting publicly ˱against˲_the Jews, showing \nd Jesus\nd* to_be the \nd Messiah\nd* by the Scriptures.
\c 19
\v 1 ¶ And ˱it˲_became at the \add time\add*, - Apollos to_be in Corinth, Paul /having/_passed_through the upper parts, /to/_come_down to Ephesus and /to/_find some disciples,
\v 2 and said to them, “- /having/_believed ˱you_all˲_received /the/_=> Holy <=_\nd Spirit\nd*?” And they \add said\add* to him, “But ˱we˲_> not_even <_heard whether ˱there˲_is Holy \nd Spirit\nd*.”
\v 3 - and, ˱he˲_said, “Therefore into what /were/_˱you_all˲_baptized?” And they said, “Into the baptism ˱of˲_John.”
\v 4 And Paul said, “John baptized ˱with˲_/a/_baptism ˱of˲_repentance, saying ˱to˲_the people that ˱they˲_/may/_believe in the \add one\add* coming after him this is in - \nd Jesus\nd*.”
\v 5 And /having/_heard, ˱they˲_/were/_baptized in the name ˱of˲_the \nd Lord\nd* \nd Jesus\nd*.
\v 6 And - ˱of˲_Paul /having/_laying_on ˱on˲_them /his/_hands, the - Holy \nd Spirit\nd* came on them, and ˱they˲_/were/_speaking ˱with˲_tongues and /were/_prophesying.
\v 7 And the all were men about twelve.
\v 8 ¶ And /having/_come_in into the synagogue, ˱he˲_/was/_speaking_boldly for three months, discussing and persuading concerning the Kingdom - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*.
\v 9 But when some /were_being/_hardened and /were/_disbelieving, speaking_evil \add of\add* the way before the multitude, /having/_withdrew from them ˱he˲_set_apart the disciples, in_every day discussing in the school ˱of˲_Tyrannus.
\v 10 And this became for two years, so_that all the \add ones\add* dwelling_in - Asia /to/_hear the word ˱of˲_the \nd Lord\nd*, both Jews and Greeks.
\v 11 And - \nd God\nd* /was/_doing not - /having/_been_ordinary miracles, by the hands ˱of˲_Paul,
\v 12 so_that even to the \add ones\add* ailing handkerchiefs or aprons /to_be_being/_carried_away from the skin ˱of˲_him, and the diseases /to_be_being/_released from them, and the the evil spirits /to_be/_going_out.
\v 13 But some also the \add ones\add* Jewish exorcists going_around attempted /to_be/_naming over the \add ones\add* having the the evil spirits ˱in˲_the name ˱of˲_the \nd Lord\nd* \nd Jesus\nd* saying, “˱I˲_/am/_imploring you_all, - ˱by˲_\nd Jesus\nd*, whom Paul /is/_proclaiming.”
\v 14 and seven sons ˱of˲_one ˱of˲_Sceva Jewish chief_priest Were doing this.
\v 15 But the - evil spirit answering said ˱to˲_them, “- \nd Jesus\nd* ˱I˲_/am/_knowing, and - Paul ˱I˲_/am/_recognizing, but who_all are you_all?”
\v 16 And the man in whom was the - evil spirit /having/_leapt_on, on, them, /having/_exercised_lordship ˱over˲_both, ˱it˲_prevailed against ˱against˲_them, so_that /to/_escape out_of - that house naked and /having_been/_wounded.
\v 17 And this became known ˱to˲_all, both ˱to˲_Jews and Greeks, the \add ones\add* dwelling_in - Ephesus, and fear fell_on on all them, and the name ˱of˲_the \nd Lord\nd* \nd Jesus\nd* /was_being/_magnified.
\v 18 And many ˱of˲_the \add ones\add* /having/_believed, /were/_coming confessing and declaring the practices ˱of˲_them.
\v 19 And many ˱of˲_the \add ones\add* /having/_practiced the magical, /having/_brought_together their scrolls, ˱they˲_/were/_burning_up \add them\add* before all. And ˱they˲_counted_up the prices ˱of˲_them, and ˱they˲_found five ten_thousand ˱of˲_silver.
\v 20 Thus the word ˱of˲_the \nd Lord\nd* /was/_growing with power and /was/_prevailing.
\v 21 ¶ And ¶ when /was/_fulfilled these \add things\add*, purposed - Paul in the \nd Spirit\nd*, /having/_passed_through - Macedonia and Achaia, /to_be/_going to Jerusalem /having/_said, - “After the \add time\add* /to/_become me there, ˱it˲_/is/_fitting me also Rome /to/_see.”
\v 22 And /having/_sent_out into - Macedonia, two ˱of˲_the \add ones\add* serving ˱unto˲_him, Timothy and Erastus, he held_on /a/_time in - Asia.
\v 23 ¶ And concerning - that time, /a/_=> not little <=_disturbance became concerning the way.
\v 24 For /a/_certain silversmith ˱by˲_/the/_name Demetrius, making temples silver ˱of˲_Artemis, /was/_bringing_about no little business ˱to˲_the craftsmen,
\v 25 whom /having/_convened_together also the workers about - such \add things\add*, ˱he˲_said, “Men, ˱you_all˲_/are/_knowing that the prosperity ˱to˲_us is from this - business.
\v 26 And ˱you_all˲_/are/_observing and /are/_hearing that not only Ephesus, but almost ˱of˲_all - Asia, - this Paul /having/_persuaded, redirected much crowd, saying that the \add ones\add* by /our/_hands becoming ˱they˲_are not gods.
\v 27 But this /is/_=> not only <=_risking_danger ˱to˲_us, the trade /to/_come into disrepute, but also the temple ˱of˲_the great goddess ˱of˲_Artemis, /to_be/_reckoned for nothing, but ˱of˲_the greatness ˱of˲_her /to_be/_going also /to_be_being/_taken_down, whom all - Asia and the inhabited_world /is/_worshipping.”
\v 28 ¶ And /having/_heard, and /having/_become full ˱of˲_rage, ˱they˲_/were/_crying_out saying, “Great \add is\add* - Artemis ˱of˲_/the/_Ephesians.”
\v 29 And the city /was/_filled - ˱of˲_confusion, and ˱they˲_rushed with_one_accord to the theatre, /having/_seized Macedonians Gaius and Aristarchus, travelling_companions ˱of˲_Paul.
\v 30 But Paul wishing /to/_come_in to the public, the disciples /were/_=> not <=_allowing him.
\v 31 And some also ˱of˲_the Asian_rulers, being friends ˱to˲_him, /having/_sent to him, ˱they˲_/were/_imploring \add him\add* not /to/_give himself into the theatre.
\v 32 Therefore indeed others /a/_certain other \add thing\add* /were/_crying_out, for the assembly was /having_been/_confounded, and the more /had/_=> not <=_known ˱for˲_what on_account ˱they˲_/had/_come_together.
\v 33 And out_of the crowd ˱they˲_concluded Alexander, ˱of˲_the Jews /having/_put_ him _forward. And - Alexander /having/_gestured his hand, /was/_wanting /to_be/_defending ˱to˲_the public.
\v 34 But /having/_recognized that ˱he˲_is /a/_Jew, cry ˱there˲_became one from all, over about two hours crying_out, “Great - Artemis ˱of˲_/the/_Ephesians!”
\v 35 And the clerk /having/_calmed the crowd /is/_saying, “Men, Ephesians, for who is ˱of˲_/the/_people, who /is/_=> not <=_knowing the city ˱of˲_/the/_Ephesians being temple_keeper ˱of˲_the great Artemis and ˱of˲_the fallen_from_Zeus \add image\add*?
\v 36 Therefore these \add things\add* being unquestionable, ˱it˲_is fitting you_all /to_be/_being /having_been/_calmed, and /to_be/_doing nothing reckless.
\v 37 For ˱you_all˲_brought - these men, neither temple-robbers nor slandering the goddess ˱of˲_us.
\v 38 If therefore on_one_hand Demetrius and the craftsmen with him /are/_having /a/_matter against anyone, courts /are_being/_brought and ˱there˲_are proconsuls, /let_˱them˲_/be_indicting ˱against˲_one_another.
\v 39 On_the_other_hand if ˱you_all˲_/are/_seeking_after anything concerning others, ˱it˲_/will_be_being/_settled in the lawful assembly.
\v 40 For ˱we˲_> also <_/are/_risking_danger /to_be_being/_indicted ˱of˲_insurrection concerning the \add day\add* today, nothing being cause, concerning which ˱we˲_/will_ not _be/_able /to/_give_back /a/_account concerning - this disorderly_gathering.” And /having/_said these \add things\add*, ˱he˲_sent_away the assembly.
\c 20
\v 1 ¶ And after the \add time\add* the commotion /to/_cease, - Paul /having/_sent_for the disciples and /having/_greeted /having/_exhorted, ˱he˲_came_out /to_be/_going to Macedonia.
\v 2 And /having/_passed_through - those districts, and /having/_exhorted them ˱with˲_> much <_speech, ˱he˲_came to - Greece.
\v 3 And /having/_worked three months, /a/_plot by the Jews /having/_become ˱to˲_him, going /to_be_being/_launched into - Syria, ˱he˲_became ˱of˲_/an/_opinion - /to_be/_returning through Macedonia.
\v 4 And Sopater ˱of˲_Pyrrhus Berean, And ˱of˲_/the/_Thessalonians Aristarchus and Secundus, and Gaius Derbean, and Timothy, And /the/_Asians Tychicus and Trophimus /was/_accompanying. ˱with˲_him.
\v 5 And these /having/_approached /were/_remaining ˱with˲_us in Troas.
\v 6 And we sailed_away from Philippi after the days - ˱of˲_Unleavened \add Bread\add*, and until five days came to them at - Troas, where ˱we˲_stayed seven days.
\v 7 And on the first \add day\add* ˱of˲_the week, us /having_been/_gathered_together /to/_break bread, - Paul /was/_discussing ˱with˲_them, going /to_be/_departing ˱on˲_the \add day\add* of_next, and /was/_prolonging the speech until midnight.
\v 8 And ˱there˲_were many lamps in the upper_room, where ˱we˲_were /having_been/_gathered_together.
\v 9 And /a/_certain young_man ˱by˲_/the/_name Eutychus sitting by the window, /being/_overcome ˱by˲_> deep <_sleep, - ˱as˲_> Paul <_discussing on more, /having_been/_overcome by - sleep, ˱he˲_fell down from the third_story, and /was/_taken_up dead.
\v 10 But /having/_come_down, - Paul fell_on ˱on˲_him and /having/_embraced \add him\add* said, “/Be_ not _being/_distressed, for the life ˱of˲_him is in him.”
\v 11 And /having/_gone_up, and /having/_broke the bread and /having/_tasted \add it\add*, and for /having/_=> much <=_conversed until daybreak, thus ˱he˲_came_out.
\v 12 And ˱they˲_brought the boy living, and /were/_comforted not moderately.
\v 13 ¶ But we, /having/_approached to the ship, /were/_launched to - Assos, from_there going /to_be/_taking_up - Paul, for thus /having_been/_directed, ˱he˲_> himself <_was going /to_be/_going_on_foot.
\v 14 And when ˱he˲_/was/_encountering ˱with˲_us in - Assos, /having/_taken_ him _up, ˱we˲_came to Mitylene.
\v 15 And_from_there /having/_sailed_away, ˱on˲_the_> following <_\add day\add* ˱we˲_arrived opposite Chios, and ˱on˲_the next \add day\add* ˱we˲_arrived in Samos, and ˱on˲_the_> following <_\add day\add* ˱we˲_came to Miletus.
\v 16 For - Paul /had/_judged /to/_sail_past - Ephesus, so_that /may/_=> not <=_become ˱to˲_him /to/_spend_time in - Asia, for ˱he˲_/was/_hurrying if possible ˱it˲_might_be ˱to˲_him, the day - ˱of˲_Pentecost /to/_become in Jerusalem.
\v 17 ¶ And from - Miletus, /having/_sent to Ephesus, ˱he˲_summoned the elders ˱of˲_the assembly.
\v 18 And when ˱they˲_arrived to him, ˱he˲_said ˱to˲_them, “You_all /are/_knowing from /the/_first day from which ˱I˲_set_foot_in in - Asia, how ˱I˲_became with you_all the whole time,
\v 19 serving ˱for˲_the \nd Lord\nd* with all humility, and tears, and trials, in the plots ˱of˲_the Jews - /having/_happened; ˱to˲_me;
\v 20 how ˱I˲_shrunk_back nothing ˱of˲_the_> benefitting <_\add things\add* - /to/_=> not <=_declare ˱to˲_you_all, and /to/_teach you_all ˱with˲_publicly and in \add all\add* homes,
\v 21 testifying ˱to˲_> both <_Jews and ˱to˲_Greeks, - repentance toward \nd God\nd* and faith toward the \nd Lord\nd* ˱of˲_us, \nd Jesus\nd*. \nd Christ\nd*.
\v 22 And now behold, I /having_been/_bound ˱by˲_the \nd Spirit\nd*, /am/_going to Jerusalem, not /having/_known the \add things\add* in it /going_to_be/_meeting ˱with˲_me.
\v 23 except that the - Holy \nd Spirit\nd* in_every city /is/_testifying ˱to˲_me, saying that bonds and tribulations /are/_remaining me.
\v 24 But ˱of˲_nothing account ˱I˲_/am/_making the life precious ˱to˲_myself, so_as ˱I˲_/may/_complete the course ˱of˲_me, and the service which ˱I˲_received from the \nd Lord\nd* \nd Jesus\nd*, /to/_testify the gospel ˱of˲_the grace - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*.
\v 25 ¶ And now behold, I /have/_known that you_all all among whom ˱I˲_passed_through proclaiming the kingdom. /will_ no_longer _be/_seeing. the face ˱of˲_me.
\v 26 Therefore ˱I˲_/am/_testifying ˱to˲_you_all in the today day that ˱I˲_am pure from the blood ˱of˲_all,
\v 27 for ˱I˲_> not <_shrunk_back - /to/_=> not <=_declare all the counsel - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd* ˱to˲_you_all.
\v 28 /Be/_taking_heed ˱to˲_yourselves and ˱to˲_all the flock, among which the - Holy \nd Spirit\nd* set you_all overseers, /to_be/_shepherding the assembly ˱of˲_the ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*, which ˱he˲_procured through his his own blood.
\v 29 I /have/_known that after the departure ˱of˲_me heavy wolves /will_be/_coming_in among you_all, not sparing ˱from˲_the flock,
\v 30 and from ˱of˲_you_all yourselves men /will_be/_rising_up speaking /having_been/_perverted \add things\add*, ˱of˲_the \add thing\add* /to_be/_drawing_out - disciples after themselves.
\v 31 Therefore /be/_watching, remembering that night and day ˱for˲_three_year, ˱I˲_> not <_ceased admonishing each one with tears.
\v 32 And now the \add things\add* ˱I˲_/am/_entrusting you_all - ˱to˲_\nd God\nd*, and ˱to˲_the word ˱of˲_the grace ˱of˲_him, - being_able /to/_build and /to/_give the /an/_inheritance among all the \add ones\add* /having_been/_sanctified.
\v 33 ˱I˲_coveted ˱of˲_silver, or gold, or clothing, ˱of˲_no_one.
\v 34 ˱you_all˲_> yourselves <_/are/_knowing that these - hands attended ˱to˲_the needs ˱of˲_me and ˱to˲_the \add ones\add* being with me.
\v 35 all \add things\add* ˱I˲_showed ˱to˲_you_all that thus laboring ˱it˲_/is/_fitting /to_be/_taking_care ˱of˲_the \add ones\add* faltering, and /to_be/_remembering ˱about˲_the words ˱of˲_the \nd Lord\nd* \nd Jesus\nd* that he said, ‘˱it˲_is more blessed, /to_be/_giving than /to_be/_receiving.’”
\v 36 ¶ And /having/_said these \add things\add*, /having/_knelt the knees ˱of˲_him, ˱he˲_prayed with them all.
\v 37 And much weeping became ˱of˲_all, and /having/_embraced on the neck - ˱of˲_Paul, ˱they˲_/were/_kissing him,
\v 38 distressing most_of_all for the word which ˱he˲_/had/_spoken that ˱they˲_/are/_=> no_longer <=_going /to_be/_observing the face ˱of˲_him. And ˱they˲_/were/_accompanying him to the ship.
\c 21
\v 1 ¶ And when ˱it˲_became us /to_be/_launched, /having_been/_withdrawn from them, /having/_run_straight ˱we˲_came to - Cos, and ˱on˲_the_> next <_\add day\add* to - Rhodes, and_from_there to Patara.
\v 2 And /having/_found /a/_ship crossing_over into Phoenicia, /having/_boarded ˱we˲_/were/_launched.
\v 3 And - Cyprus /having/_appeared, and /having/_left it ˱on˲_/the/_left, ˱we˲_/were/_sailing to Syria and ˱we˲_came_down at Tyre, for there the ship was unloading the cargo.
\v 4 And /having/_sought_out the disciples, ˱we˲_remained_on there seven days, who /were/_saying by the \nd Spirit\nd* - ˱to˲_Paul not /to_be/_setting_foot_in to Jerusalem.
\v 5 And when ˱it˲_became ˱to˲_us /to/_finish_out the days, /having/_come_out ˱we˲_/were/_journeying, wives and children accompanying with us all, as_far_as outside the city, and /having/_knelt the knees on the shore /having/_prayed,
\v 6 ˱we˲_withdrew ˱from˲_one_another and ˱we˲_went_up into the ship, and those returned to their own \add homes\add*.
\v 7 ¶ And we, /having/_completed the voyage from Tyre, arrived to Ptolemais, and /having/_greeted the brothers, ˱we˲_remained one day with them.
\v 8 And ˱on˲_the \add day\add* of_next, /having/_come_out ˱we˲_came to Caesarea, and /having/_come_in into the house ˱of˲_Philip, the gospel_preacher, being of the seven, ˱we˲_remained with him.
\v 9 And ˱with˲_this \add man\add* were four daughters, virgins prophesying.
\v 10 And remaining_on more days, /a/_certain prophet ˱by˲_/the/_name Agabus came_down from - Judea,
\v 11 and /having/_come to us, and /having/_taken_up the belt - ˱of˲_Paul, /having/_bound ˱of˲_himself the feet and the hands, ˱he˲_said, “The - Holy \nd Spirit\nd* /is/_saying these \add things\add*: ‘The man ˱of˲_whom is - this belt, thus the Jews in Jerusalem /will_be/_binding, and ˱they˲_/will_be/_giving_over \add him\add* into /the/_hands ˱of˲_/the/_pagans.’”
\v 12 And when ˱we˲_heard these \add things\add*, both we and the ˱of˲_/the/_locals /were/_imploring, - him not /to_be/_going_up to Jerusalem.
\v 13 Then - Paul answered, “What /are/_˱you_all˲_doing, weeping and breaking the heart ˱of˲_me? For I ˱I˲_/am/_having ready not only /to_be/_bound, but also /to/_die_off in Jerusalem, for the name ˱of˲_the \nd Lord\nd* \nd Jesus\nd*.”
\v 14 And him not /being/_persuaded, ˱we˲_kept_quiet /having/_said, “The will ˱of˲_the \nd Lord\nd* /let_be/_becoming.”
\v 15 ¶ And after - these days, /having/_made_preparations, ˱we˲_/were/_going_up to Jerusalem.
\v 16 And also ˱of˲_the disciples from Caesarea came_together with us, bringing \add us\add* ˱to˲_Mnason /a/_certain ancient Cyprian disciple with whom ˱we˲_/may_be/_lodged.
\v 17 ¶ And ˱of˲_us /having/_become at Jerusalem, the brothers gladly welcomed us.
\v 18 and ˱on˲_the \add day\add* following, - Paul /was/_entering with us to Jacobus, and all the elders arrived.
\v 19 And /having/_greeted them, ˱he˲_/was/_explaining by each one, ˱of˲_what - \nd God\nd* did among the pagans by the service ˱of˲_him.
\v 20 And they /having/_heard /were/_glorifying - \nd God\nd*, and ˱they˲_said ˱to˲_him, “˱You˲_/are/_observing, brother, how_many myriads are among the Jews - /having/_believed, and ˱they˲_/are/_=> all <=_being zealous ˱for˲_the law.
\v 21 And ˱they˲_/were/_instructed concerning you, that ˱you˲_/are/_teaching apostasy from Moses all Jews the \add ones\add* among the pagans, saying them not /to_be/_circumcising their children, nor /to_be/_walking ˱in˲_the customs.
\v 22 Therefore what is_˱it˲? Certainly ˱they˲_/will_be/_hearing that ˱you˲_/have/_come.
\v 23 Therefore do this, what ˱we˲_/are/_saying ˱to˲_you. Four Men are ˱with˲_us, having /a/_vow for themselves.
\v 24 /Having/_taken these \add men\add*, /be/_purified with them and spend for them, in_order_that ˱they˲_/will_be/_shaving his head, and all /will_be/_knowing that ˱of˲_which ˱they˲_/have_been/_instructed about you nothing is, but ˱you˲_/are/_aligning also yourself, keeping the law.
\v 25 But concerning the pagans /having/_believed, we sent_out /having/_judged them /to_be/_keeping, ˱from˲_the jointly idol_sacrificed \add thing\add*, and blood, and strangled \add animals\add*, and sexual_immorality.”
\v 26 Then - Paul /having/_taken the men, ˱on˲_the following day with them /having_been/_purified, /was/_entering into the temple, proclaiming the fulfillment ˱of˲_the days ˱of˲_the purification, until ˱of˲_which the offering /was/_offered for each one ˱of˲_them.
\v 27 ¶ And when the seven days /were/_going, /to_be_being/_completed, the Jews from - Asia, /having/_seen him in the temple, /were/_confounding all the crowd, and ˱they˲_laid_on their hands on him
\v 28 crying_out, “Men, Israelites, /be/_giving_help! This is the man, who teaching all everywhere against the people, and the law, and - this place, and still also brought_in Greeks into the temple, and /has/_defiled - this holy place.”
\v 29 For ˱they˲_were /having/_previously_seen Trophimus the Ephesian in the city with him, whom ˱they˲_/were/_thinking that - Paul brought_in into the temple.
\v 30 And the whole city /was/_stirred, and /a/_rushing_together ˱of˲_the people became, and /having/_taken_hold - ˱of˲_Paul, ˱they˲_/were/_dragging him outside the temple, and immediately the doors /were/_shut.
\v 31 and seeking /to/_kill_ him _off, ˱there˲_went_up /an/_allegation ˱to˲_the commander ˱of˲_the cohort, that all Jerusalem /is_being/_confounded,
\v 32 who immediately /having/_taken soldiers and centurions, ran_down on them, and - /having/_seen the commander and the soldiers, ˱they˲_ceased striking - Paul.
\v 33 Then /having/_neared, the commander took_hold ˱of˲_him, and commanded \add him\add* /to_be/_bound ˱with˲_> two <_chains, and ˱he˲_/was/_inquiring who ˱he˲_might_be and what ˱he˲_is /having/_done.
\v 34 But others, /were/_crying_out some other \add thing\add* in the crowd. And him not ˱of˲_being_able /to/_know the certain \add thing\add* because_of the commotion, ˱he˲_commanded him /to_be_being/_brought into the barracks.
\v 35 And when ˱he˲_became to the stairs, ˱it˲_happened him /to_be_being/_borne by the soldiers, because_of the force ˱of˲_the crowd.
\v 36 For the multitude ˱of˲_the people /was/_following crying_out, “/Be/_Taking_ him _away.”
\v 37 ¶ And going /to_be_being/_brought_in into the barracks, - Paul /is/_saying ˱to˲_the commander, “- /is/_˱it˲_permitting ˱to˲_me /to/_say something to you?” And he /was/_saying, “˱You˲_/are/_knowing In_Greek?
\v 38 Consequently are you not the Egyptian, who before these - days, /having/_upset and /having/_led_out the four_thousand men ˱of˲_the assassins into the desert?”
\v 39 But - Paul said, “On_one_hand I am /a/_Jewish /a/_man, Tarsian, - ˱of˲_Cilicia, /a/_citizen ˱of˲_/an/_=> not <=_insignificant city. On_the_other_hand ˱I˲_/am/_beseeching ˱of˲_you, permit ˱to˲_me /to/_speak to the people.”
\v 40 And ˱of˲_> him <_/having/_permitted, - Paul /having/_stood on the stairs, gestured ˱with˲_his hand ˱to˲_the people, and great silence /having/_become, ˱he˲_called_out ˱in˲_his Hebrew language saying,
\c 22
\v 1 “Men, brothers, and fathers, hear - to you_all now ˱of˲_/the/_defense ˱of˲_me.”
\v 2 (And /having/_heard that ˱he˲_/was/_calling_out ˱to˲_them ˱in˲_the Hebrew language, ˱they˲_brought_about more quietness.) And ˱he˲_/is/_saying:
\v 3 “I am /a/_=> Jewish <=_man, /having_been/_born in Tarsus - ˱of˲_Cilicia, but /having_been/_brought_up in - this city, before the feet ˱of˲_Gamaliel, /having_been/_instructed according_to /the/_exactness ˱of˲_our ancestral law, being zealous - ˱for˲_\nd God\nd*, as all you_all are today,
\v 4 who ˱I˲_persecuted this - Way until death, binding and giving_over to prisons, both men and women,
\v 5 as also the chief_priest /was/_testifying ˱to˲_me and all the council_of_elders; from whom also /having/_received letters to the brothers, ˱I˲_/was/_going to Damascus, /going_to/_=> also <=_bring the \add ones\add* being there, /having_been/_bound to Jerusalem, in_order_that ˱they˲_/may_be/_punished.
\v 6 ¶ But ˱it˲_became ˱to˲_me journeying, and nearing - ˱to˲_Damascus about midday, suddenly much light from the sky /to/_flash_around around me.
\v 7 And ˱I˲_fell to the ground, and ˱I˲_heard ˱of˲_/a/_voice saying ˱to˲_me, ‘Saul, Saul, why /are/_˱you˲_persecuting me?’
\v 8 And I answered, ‘Who are_˱you˲, lord?’ And ˱he˲_said to me, ‘I am \nd Jesus\nd* the Nazarene, whom you /are/_persecuting.’
\v 9 And the \add ones\add* being with me, on_one_hand ˱they˲_saw the light, on_the_other_hand ˱they˲_> not <_heard the voice ˱of˲_the \add one\add* speaking ˱to˲_me.
\v 10 And ˱I˲_said ‘What /may/_˱I˲_do, \nd Lord\nd*?’ And the \nd Lord\nd* said to me, ‘/Having/_risen_up /be/_going to Damascus, and_there /will_be_being/_spoken ˱to˲_you concerning all \add things\add* that /has_been/_determined ˱for˲_you /to/_do.’
\v 11 But as ˱I˲_/was/_=> not <=_focusing_in because_of the glory ˱of˲_that - light, /being/_led_by_hand by the \add ones\add* being_with ˱with˲_me, ˱I˲_came to Damascus.
\v 12 ¶ And Ananias /a/_certain devout man according_to the law, /being/_attested by all the Jews dwelling \add there\add*,
\v 13 /having/_come to me and /having/_stood_by, ˱he˲_said ˱to˲_me, ‘Saul, brother, receive_sight.’ And_I looked_up on him ˱to˲_> the <_same hour.
\v 14 And he said, ‘The \nd God\nd* ˱of˲_the fathers ˱of˲_us appointed you /to/_know the will ˱of˲_him, and /to/_see the Righteous \add One\add*, and /to/_hear /the/_voice out_of the mouth ˱of˲_him.
\v 15 Because ˱you˲_will_be /a/_witness ˱for˲_him to all people, ˱of˲_what \add things\add* ˱you˲_/have/_seen and heard.
\v 16 And now why /are/_˱you˲_waiting? /Having/_risen_up, baptize and wash_away the sins ˱of˲_you, /having/_appealed ˱to˲_the name ˱of˲_him.’
\v 17 ¶ And ˱it˲_became ˱to˲_me, /having/_returned to Jerusalem, and praying ˱of˲_me in the temple, me /to/_become in /a/_trance,
\v 18 and /to/_see him saying ˱to˲_me, ‘Hurry and come_out with quickness out_of Jerusalem, because ˱they˲_/will_ not _be/_accepting ˱of˲_you /the/_testimony concerning me.’
\v 19 And_I said, ‘\nd Lord\nd*, they /are/_knowing that I was imprisoning and beating in the synagogues, the \add ones\add* believing in you.
\v 20 And when the blood ˱of˲_Stephen the witness ˱of˲_you, /was_being/_poured_out, ˱I˲_> myself <_was also /having/_stood_by, and consenting, and keeping the clothes ˱of˲_the \add ones\add* killing him.’
\v 21 And ˱he˲_said to me, ‘/Be/_going, because I /will_be/_sending_ you _away to far pagans.’”
\v 22 ¶ And ¶ ˱they˲_/were/_hearing ˱from˲_him until this - word, and ˱they˲_lifted_up the voice ˱of˲_them saying, “/Be/_taking_away - such \add man\add* from the earth, for ˱it˲_/was/_=> not <=_befitting him /to_be/_living!”
\v 23 and them Crying_out, and throwing_down their clothes, and casting dust into the air,
\v 24 the commander commanded him /to_be_being/_brought_in into the barracks, /having/_said him /to_be_being/_interrogated ˱by˲_floggings, in_order_that ˱he˲_/may/_know for what cause ˱they˲_/were/_crying_out thus ˱to˲_him.
\v 25 But as ˱they˲_stretched_ him _out ˱with˲_the straps, - Paul said to the centurion /having/_stood, /is/_˱it˲_permitting ˱to˲_you_all /to_be/_flogging - /a/_man Roman and uncondemned?”
\v 26 And /having/_heard \add it\add* the centurion, /having/_approached ˱to˲_the commander, ˱he˲_reported saying, “What /are/_˱you˲_going /to_be/_doing? For - this man is /a/_Roman.”
\v 27 And /having/_approached, the commander said ˱to˲_him, “/Be/_telling ˱to˲_me, are you /a/_Roman?” And he /was/_saying, “Yes.”
\v 28 and the commander answered, “I this - acquired citizenship ˱of˲_/a/_great sum.” But - Paul /was/_saying, “But I even /have_been/_born \add free\add*.”
\v 29 Therefore the \add ones\add* going /to_be/_interrogating him immediately withdrew from him, the also and /was/_=> commander <=_afraid, /having/_learned that ˱he˲_is /a/_Roman, and because ˱he˲_was /having/_bound him.
\v 30 ¶ But ˱on˲_the \add day\add* of_next, wishing /to/_know - ˱for˲_certain, - why ˱he˲_/is_being/_accused by the Jews, ˱he˲_released him, and commanded the chief_priests and all the Sanhedrin, /to/_come_together; and /having/_brought_down - Paul, ˱he˲_set \add him\add* among them.
\c 23
\v 1 And - Paul /having/_looked_intently ˱at˲_the Sanhedrin said, “Men, brothers, I ˱in˲_all conscience /have/_lived_as_citizen good - ˱to˲_\nd God\nd* until this - day.”
\v 2 And Ananias the chief_priest commanded ˱to˲_the \add ones\add* /having/_stood_by him, /to_be/_striking the mouth ˱of˲_him.
\v 3 Then - Paul said to him, “- \nd God\nd* /is/_going /to_be/_striking you, wall /having_been/_whitewashed! And /are/_=> you <=_sitting judging me according_to the law, and ˱you˲_/are/_=> violating_law <=_commanding me /to_be_being/_struck?”
\v 4 But the \add ones\add* /having/_stood_by said, “/Are/_˱you˲_insulting the chief_priest - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*?”
\v 5 And - Paul /was/_saying, “˱I˲_/had/_=> not <=_known, brothers, that ˱he˲_is /a/_chief_priest; for ˱it˲_/has_been/_written, - ‘˱you˲_/will_ not _be/_speaking wrongly /a/_ruler ˱of˲_the people ˱of˲_you.’”
\v 6 ¶ But - Paul /having/_known that - one part is ˱of˲_Sadducees, but the /the/_other ˱of˲_Pharisees, ˱he˲_/was/_crying_out in the Sanhedrin, “Men, brothers, I am /a/_Pharisee, /the/_son ˱of˲_Pharisees; I /am_being/_judged concerning /the/_hope and resurrection ˱of˲_/the/_dead.”
\v 7 And ˱of˲_him speaking this, /a/_dissension became ˱between˲_the Pharisees and Sadducees, and the multitude /was/_divided.
\v 8 For indeed /the/_Sadducees /are/_saying to_be no resurrection, neither /an/_angel, nor /a/_spirit, But /the/_Pharisees /are/_confessing - both.
\v 9 And /a/_=> great <=_clamor became, and some ˱of˲_the scribes ˱of˲_the side ˱of˲_the Pharisees /having/_stood_up, ˱they˲_/were/_contending saying, “˱We˲_/are/_finding nothing evil in - this man; and \add what\add* if /a/_spirit spoke ˱to˲_him, or /an/_angel?”
\v 10 And becoming great, dissension, the commander /having_been/_afraid lest - Paul /may_be/_torn_apart by them, commanded the army /having/_come_down, /to/_snatch him from midst ˱of˲_them, and /to_be/_bringing \add him\add* into the barracks.
\v 11 ¶ But ˱on˲_the following night, the \nd Lord\nd* /having/_approached ˱to˲_him, said, “/Be/_having_courage, for as ˱you˲_testified the \add things\add* about me at Jerusalem, thus ˱it˲_/is/_fitting you /to/_testify also at Rome.”
\v 12 And ˱it˲_/having/_become day, the Jews /having/_made /a/_disorderly_gathering, cursed themselves, saying neither /to/_eat nor /to/_drink, until ˱of˲_which ˱they˲_/may/_kill_off - Paul.
\v 13 And were more \add than\add* forty the \add ones\add* ˱in˲_this /having/_made - conspiracy;
\v 14 who /having/_approached ˱to˲_the chief_priests and the elders said, “˱With˲_/a/_curse ˱we˲_cursed ourselves, /to/_taste ˱of˲_nothing until ˱of˲_which ˱we˲_/may/_kill_off - Paul.
\v 15 Therefore now you_all with the Sanhedrin report ˱to˲_the commander, so_that ˱he˲_/may/_bring_ him _down to you_all, as going /to_be/_investigating more_exactly the \add things\add* concerning him; and we are ready /to/_kill him before the \add time\add* him /to/_near, -.”
\v 16 ¶ But the son ˱of˲_the sister ˱of˲_Paul /having/_heard, the ambush /having/_arrived, and /having/_come_in into the barracks, ˱he˲_reported \add it\add* - ˱to˲_Paul.
\v 17 And - Paul /having/_called_to one ˱of˲_the centurions, ˱he˲_/was/_saying, /be/_bringing_up this - young_man to the commander, for ˱he˲_/is/_having something /to/_report ˱to˲_him.”
\v 18 Therefore indeed the \add one\add* /having/_taken him, brought \add him\add* to the commander, and ˱he˲_/is/_saying, “The prisoner, Paul, /having/_called_to me, asked /to/_lead this - young_man to you, having something /to/_tell ˱to˲_you.”
\v 19 And the commander /having/_taken_hold ˱of˲_the hand ˱of˲_him, and /having/_withdrawn by himself, ˱he˲_/was/_inquiring, “What is \add it\add* that ˱you˲_/are/_having /to/_report ˱to˲_me?”
\v 20 And ˱he˲_said, - “The Jews decided - /to/_ask you, so_that tomorrow ˱you˲_/may/_bring_down - Paul into the Sanhedrin, as going /to_be/_inquiring something more_exactly concerning him.
\v 21 Therefore you /may_ not _be/_persuaded ˱by˲_them, for forty of them men \add than\add* more /are/_lying_in_wait him, who cursed themselves neither /to/_eat nor /to/_drink, until ˱of˲_which ˱they˲_/may/_kill him, and now ˱they˲_are ready, waiting_for the promise from you.”
\v 22 Therefore indeed the commander sent_away the young_man /having/_commanded, “/To/_tell ˱to˲_no_one that ˱you˲_reported these \add things\add* to me.”
\v 23 ¶ And /having/_called_to some two ˱of˲_the centurions, ˱he˲_said, “Prepare two_hundred soldiers, so_that /may_be/_gone as_far_as Caesarea, and seventy horsemen, and two_hundred spearmen for /the/_third hour ˱of˲_the night.”
\v 24 And mounts /to/_present, in_order_that /having/_mounted - Paul, ˱they˲_/may/_bring_safely_through \add him\add* to Felix the governor,
\v 25 /having/_written /a/_letter, having - this pattern:
\v 26 “Claudius Lysias, /to_be/_greeting ˱to˲_the most_excellent governor Felix.
\v 27 - this man /having_been/_captured by the Jews, and going /to_be_being/_killed by them, /having/_approached with their army, ˱I˲_rescued \add him\add* /having/_learned that ˱he˲_is /a/_Roman.
\v 28 And wishing /to/_know the charge because_of which ˱they˲_/were/_indicting ˱against˲_him, ˱I˲_brought_down \add him\add* to the Sanhedrin ˱of˲_them.
\v 29 Whom ˱I˲_found /being/_indicted concerning questions ˱of˲_the law ˱of˲_them, but nothing having indictment worthy ˱of˲_death or ˱of˲_bonds.
\v 30 And /having_been/_divulged ˱to˲_me ˱of˲_/a/_plot going_to_be against the man, ˱I˲_sent \add him\add* from them to you, /having/_=> also <=_commanded ˱to˲_the accusers them /to_be/_speaking before you.”
\v 31 ¶ Therefore indeed the soldiers according_to the \add thing\add* /having_been/_directed ˱to˲_them, /having/_taken_up - Paul, brought \add him\add* by night to - Antipatris.
\v 32 But ˱on˲_the \add day\add* of_ next, /having/_allowed the horsemen /to_be/_going_away with him, ˱they˲_returned to the barracks;
\v 33 who /having/_come_in into - Caesarea, and /having/_delivered_up the letter ˱to˲_the governor, ˱they˲_> also <_presented - Paul ˱to˲_him.
\v 34 And /having/_read \add it\add*, and /having/_asked of what province ˱he˲_is, and /having/_learned that \add he_is\add* from Cilicia,
\v 35 “˱he˲_/was/_saying “˱I˲_/will_be/_thoroughly_hearing ˱from˲_you”, “whenever also the accusers ˱of˲_you /may/_arrive”, /having/_commanded ˱for˲_him /to_be_being/_guarded in the praetorium - ˱of˲_Herod.
\c 24
\v 1 ¶ And after five days, Ananias the chief_priest came_down with some elders, and Tertullus /a/_certain /an/_attorney, who reported ˱to˲_the governor against - Paul.
\v 2 And ˱of˲_him /having_been/_called, - Tertullus began /to_be/_accusing \add him\add* saying, “˱Of˲_great peace obtaining through you, and ˱of˲_/the/_reforms becoming - ˱to˲_> this <_nation through - your provision,
\v 3 both everything and everywhere, most_excellent Felix ˱we˲_/are/_welcoming \add it\add*, with all thanksgiving.
\v 4 But in_order_that ˱I˲_/may_ not _be/_hindering more for you, - ˱in˲_your gentleness ˱I˲_/am/_imploring you /to/_hear ˱from˲_us briefly.
\v 5 For /having/_found - this man /a/_pestilence, and stirring insurrections ˱to˲_all the Jews - in the inhabited_world, and /a/_ring_leader ˱of˲_the ˱of˲_the Nazarenes sect,
\v 6 who even attempted /to/_profane the temple, also whom ˱we˲_apprehended.
\v 7
\v 8 from whom ˱you˲_/will_be/_able yourself, /having/_examined \add him\add* concerning all these \add things\add*, /to/_know ˱of˲_which \add things\add* we /are/_accusing ˱against˲_him.”
\v 9 And the Jews also piled_on, alleging these \add things\add* /to_be/_having thus.
\v 10 ¶ And - Paul answered, the governor /having/_nodded ˱to˲_him /to_be/_speaking, this for many years you being judge - ˱to˲_nation “Knowing, ˱I˲_/am/_=> cheerfully <=_defending the \add things\add* concerning myself.
\v 11 ˱Of˲_you being_able /to/_know that ˱there˲_are not more ˱to˲_me twelve days, from which ˱I˲_went_up /going_to/_worship in Jerusalem.
\v 12 And ˱they˲_found me neither in the temple discussing with anyone or making /a/_opposition ˱of˲_/a/_crowd, neither in the synagogues, nor in the city,
\v 13 nor /are/_˱they˲_being_able /to/_stand_by ˱to˲_you, concerning which now ˱they˲_/are/_accusing ˱against˲_me.
\v 14 But ˱I˲_/am/_confessing this ˱to˲_you that according_to the Way which ˱they˲_/are/_calling /a/_sect, thus ˱I˲_/am/_serving ˱unto˲_the ancestral \nd God\nd*, believing ˱in˲_all the \add things\add* throughout the law and ˱in˲_the \add things\add* /having_been/_written in the prophets,
\v 15 having /a/_hope in - \nd God\nd*, which also these themselves /are/_waiting_for, /a/_resurrection /to_be/_going going_to_be, ˱of˲_/the/_righteous both and ˱of˲_/the/_unrighteous.
\v 16 In this also ˱I˲_> myself <_/am/_exercising, /a/_=> inoffensive <=_conscience /to_be/_having toward - \nd God\nd* and - people through everything.
\v 17 And through more years ˱I˲_arrived /going_to/_make alms to the nation ˱of˲_me and offerings,
\v 18 at which ˱they˲_found me in the temple /having_been/_purified, neither with /a/_crowd, nor with commotion.
\v 19 But some Jews from - Asia, who ˱it˲_/was/_fitting /to_be/_being_present before you and /to_be/_accusing, if anything /might_be/_having against me.
\v 20 Or /let/_=> these themselves <=_say, what ˱they˲_found wrong, /having/_stood ˱of˲_me before the Sanhedrin,
\v 21 than concerning this one voice, which ˱I˲_cried_out among them /having/_stood: - ‘I /am_being/_judged by you_all today concerning /the/_resurrection ˱of˲_/the/_dead.’”
\v 22 ¶ But - Felix ˱he˲_put_off them, /having/_known more_exactly the \add things\add* concerning the Way, /having/_said, “Whenever Lysias the commander /may/_come_down, ˱I˲_/will_be/_investigating the \add things\add* concerning you_all”;
\v 23 /having/_directed ˱to˲_the centurion him /to_be_being/_kept, and /to_be/_having relaxation, and /to_be/_forbidding no_one ˱of˲_his own \add people\add* ˱of˲_him /to_be/_attending ˱to˲_him.
\v 24 ¶ But after some days, - Felix /having/_arrived with Drusilla, his own wife being /a/_Jew, ˱he˲_sent_for - Paul, and heard ˱from˲_him concerning the faith in \nd Christ\nd*.
\v 25 But him discussing concerning righteousness, and self-control, and the judgment - coming, - Felix /having/_become frightened, answered, “the_> Present <_\add time\add* being /be/_going, and /having/_taken time, ˱I˲_/will_be/_summoning you.”
\v 26 Together also hoping that money /will_be_being/_given ˱to˲_him by - Paul, therefore also more_frequently sending_for him, ˱he˲_/was/_conversing ˱with˲_him.
\v 27 ¶ But two_years /having_been/_fulfilled, - Felix received successor Porcius Festus; and wanting /to/_grant /a/_favor ˱to˲_the Jews, - Felix left - Paul /having_been/_bound.
\c 25
\v 1 ¶ Therefore Festus /having/_set_foot_in ˱in˲_the province after three, days went_up to Jerusalem from Caesarea.
\v 2 And the chief_priests and the leaders ˱of˲_the Jews reported ˱to˲_him against - Paul, and ˱they˲_/were/_imploring him,
\v 3 requesting /a/_favor against him, so_that ˱he˲_/may/_send_for him to Jerusalem (making /an/_ambush /to/_kill him on the way).
\v 4 Therefore indeed - Festus answered, - Paul /to_be_being/_kept in Caesarea, and himself /to_be/_going in quickness /to_be/_going_out.
\v 5 “Therefore the powerful \add ones\add* among you_all”, “˱he˲_/is/_saying, /having/_gone_down_with, if anything perverse is in the man, ˱them˲_/let_be/_accusing ˱against˲_him.”
\v 6 ¶ And /having/_stayed among them not more eight or ten days, /having/_come_down to Caesarea, ˱on˲_the \add day\add* of_next /having/_sat_down on the tribunal, ˱he˲_commanded - Paul /to_be/_brought.
\v 7 And ˱of˲_him /having/_arrived, the Jews /having/_come_down from Jerusalem stood_around him, bringing_against many and heavy charges, which ˱they˲_were_ not _able /to/_demonstrate,
\v 8 - ˱of˲_Paul defending, - “˱I˲_sinned neither against the law ˱of˲_the Jews, nor against the temple, nor anything against Caesar.”
\v 9 But - Festus wanting /to/_grant favor ˱with˲_the Jews, answering - ˱to˲_Paul ˱he˲_said, “/Are/_˱you˲_willing to /having/_gone_up Jerusalem concerning these \add things\add* /to_be/_judged there before me?”
\v 10 But - Paul said, “Before the tribunal ˱of˲_Caesar /having/_stood ˱I˲_am, where ˱it˲_/is/_fitting me /to_be_being/_judged. ˱I˲_/have/_done_ nothing _wrong ˱To˲_/the/_Jews, as also you very_well /are/_knowing.
\v 11 Therefore if on_one_hand ˱I˲_/am/_doing_wrong and ˱I˲_/have/_done anything worthy ˱of˲_death, ˱I˲_/am/_=> not <=_refusing - /to/_die_off; on_the_other_hand if nothing is \add true\add* ˱of˲_which these /are/_accusing ˱against˲_me, no_one /is/_able /to/_grant me ˱to˲_them. ˱I˲_/am/_Appealing ˱to˲_Caesar!”
\v 12 Then - Festus /having/_conversed_with with the counsel, answered, “˱You˲_/have/_appealed ˱to˲_Caesar, ˱you˲_/will_be/_going to Caesar!”
\v 13 ¶ And some days /having/_elapsed, Agrippa the king and Bernice arrived to Caesarea, /having/_greeted - Festus.
\v 14 And as ˱they˲_/were/_staying there more days, - Festus placed_before ˱before˲_the king the \add things\add* concerning - Paul saying, certain /a/_man “˱There˲_is, /a/_prisoner /having_been/_left by Felix,
\v 15 concerning whom ˱of˲_me /having/_become in Jerusalem, the chief_priests and the elders ˱of˲_the Jews reported, requesting conviction against him;
\v 16 to whom ˱I˲_answered that ˱it˲_is not /the/_custom ˱with˲_Romans /to_be/_granting any person before - the \add one\add* /being/_accused, /might_be/_having to face the accusers and /the/_place ˱of˲_defense /might/_take concerning the indictment.
\v 17 Therefore ˱of˲_them /having/_come_together, here, /having/_made not_one delay, ˱on˲_the_> next <_\add day\add* /having/_sat_down on the tribunal, ˱I˲_commanded the man /to_be/_brought;
\v 18 concerning whom the accusers /having_been/_stood ˱they˲_/were/_bringing not_one charge, ˱of˲_which I /was/_suspecting evil \add ones\add*.
\v 19 But ˱they˲_/were/_having against him some questions concerning their own superstition, and concerning /a/_certain \nd Jesus\nd* /having/_died, whom - Paul /was/_alleging /to_be/_living.
\v 20 And I perplexing, the debate concerning these \add things\add*, /was/_asking if /might_be/_wishing /to_be/_going to Jerusalem, and_there /to_be_being/_judged concerning these \add things\add*.
\v 21 But - Paul /having/_appealed /to_be/_kept himself for the investigation ˱of˲_the Emperor, ˱I˲_commanded him /to_be_being/_kept, until ˱of˲_which ˱I˲_/may/_send_ him _up to Caesar.”
\v 22 And Agrippa \add said\add* to - Festus, “˱I˲_/was/_wishing also myself /to/_hear ˱from˲_the man.” “Tomorrow”, ˱he˲_/is/_saying, “˱you˲_/will_be/_hearing ˱from˲_him.”
\v 23 ¶ Therefore ˱on˲_the \add day\add* of_next, - Agrippa and - Bernice /having/_come with great pageantry, and /having/_come_in into the auditorium with both commanders and men - in prominence ˱in˲_the city, and /having/_commanded - Festus, - Paul /was/_brought.
\v 24 And - Festus /is/_saying, “King Agrippa, and all you_all being_present_with ˱with˲_us, men, ˱you_all˲_/are/_observing this \add one\add*, concerning whom all the multitude ˱of˲_the Jews pleaded ˱with˲_me, in both Jerusalem and here, shouting not /to_be/_fitting him /to_be/_living no_longer.
\v 25 But I grasped him /to_have/_done nothing worthy ˱of˲_death, and this \add one\add* himself /having/_appealed ˱to˲_the Emperor, ˱I˲_judged /to_be/_sending \add him\add*.
\v 26 Concerning whom ˱I˲_/am/_=> not <=_having any certain /to/_write ˱to˲_my lord. Therefore ˱I˲_brought_ him _forth before you_all, and most_of_all before you, King Agrippa, so_that the examination /having/_become, ˱I˲_/may/_have something ˱I˲_/may/_write.
\v 27 For ˱it˲_/is/_supposing ˱to˲_me illogical sending /a/_prisoner, not also /to/_signify the charges against him.”
\c 26
\v 1 ¶ And Agrippa /was/_saying to - Paul, “˱It˲_/is_being/_permitted ˱to˲_you /to_be/_speaking concerning yourself.” Then - Paul /having/_stretched_out his hand /was/_defending,
\v 2 “Concerning all ˱of˲_which ˱I˲_/am_being/_indicted by /the/_Jews, King Agrippa, ˱I˲_/have/_considered myself blessed going /to_be/_defending before you, today.
\v 3 Most_of_all you being knowledgeable_one ˱of˲_all the among /the/_Jews, ˱of˲_> both <_customs and questions; therefore ˱I˲_/am/_beseeching \add you\add* patiently /to/_hear ˱from˲_me.
\v 4 ¶ Therefore indeed the livelihood ˱of˲_me, from youth - from /the/_beginning /having/_become among the nation ˱of˲_me and in Jerusalem, all Jews /have/_known,
\v 5 knowing_before me originally, if ˱they˲_/may_be/_willing /to_be/_testifying that according_to the most_exact sect - ˱of˲_our religion, ˱I˲_lived /a/_Pharisee.
\v 6 And now for /the/_hope ˱of˲_the promise to the fathers ˱of˲_us, /having/_become by - \nd God\nd*, ˱I˲_/have/_stood /being/_judged,
\v 7 to which the twelve_tribes ˱of˲_us serving night and day in earnestness, /is/_hoping /to/_attain; concerning which /the/_hope ˱I˲_/am_being/_indicted by /the/_Jews, King.
\v 8 Why /is_˱it˲_/being_judged unbelievable by you_all, if - \nd God\nd* /is/_raising /the/_dead?
\v 9 ¶ Therefore indeed I supposed ˱to˲_myself ˱it˲_/to_be/_fitting /to/_do many contrary \add things\add* to the name ˱of˲_\nd Jesus\nd* - ˱of˲_Nazarene.
\v 10 Which also ˱I˲_did in Jerusalem, and many both ˱of˲_the holy \add ones\add* I locked_up in prisons, /having/_received the authority from the chief_priests, and ˱of˲_them /being/_killed, ˱I˲_brought_ /a/_vote _against \add them\add*.
\v 11 And in all the synagogues, often punishing them, ˱I˲_/was/_compelling \add them\add* /to_be/_slandering, and exceedingly raging_against ˱against˲_them, ˱I˲_/was/_persecuting \add them\add* as_far_as even to the outside cities.
\v 12 ¶ At which journeying to - Damascus, with /the/_authority and permission - ˱of˲_the chief_priests,
\v 13 middle day on the road King ˱I˲_saw, from_heaven /a/_light above the brightness \add like\add* ˱of˲_the sun /having/_shone_around me, and the \add ones\add* journeying with me.
\v 14 And all ˱of˲_us /having/_falling_down to the ground, ˱I˲_heard /a/_voice, saying to me ˱in˲_the Hebrew language, ‘Saul, Saul, why /are/_˱you˲_persecuting me? \add It_is\add* hard ˱for˲_you /to_be/_kicking against /the/_prods.’
\v 15 And I said, ‘Who ˱you˲_are, lord?’ And the \nd Lord\nd* said, ‘I am \nd Jesus\nd*, whom you /are/_persecuting.
\v 16 But rise_up, and stand on the feet ˱of˲_you; for ˱I˲_/was/_seen ˱by˲_you in this, /to/_appoint you /a/_attendant and /a/_witness, both ˱of˲_which ˱you˲_saw me and ˱of˲_which ˱I˲_/will_be_being/_seen ˱by˲_you,
\v 17 rescuing you from the people and from the pagans, to whom I /am/_sending_ you _out,
\v 18 /to/_open_up eyes ˱of˲_them, ˱for˲_that /to/_turn_back from darkness to light, and ˱from˲_the power - ˱of˲_Satan to - \nd God\nd*, ˱for˲_that them /to/_receive forgiveness ˱of˲_sins and lot among the \add ones\add* /having_been/_sanctified ˱by˲_faith - in me.’
\v 19 ¶ Whence, King Agrippa, ˱I˲_became not unpersuadable ˱to˲_the heavenly vision,
\v 20 but ˱to˲_the \add ones\add* in Damascus first and both, ˱in˲_Jerusalem, and all the region - ˱of˲_Judea, and ˱to˲_the pagans, ˱I˲_/was/_reporting /to_be/_repenting and /to_be/_turning_back to - \nd God\nd*, - worthy ˱of˲_> works <_repentance doing.
\v 21 On_account these \add things\add*, /the/_Jews /having/_captured me in the temple, /were/_attempting /to/_hand_over \add me\add*.
\v 22 Therefore /having/_obtained ˱of˲_help - from - \nd God\nd* until - this day, ˱I˲_/have/_stood testifying ˱to˲_small both and ˱to˲_great, nothing besides saying ˱of˲_what \add things\add* both the prophets and Moses spoke going /to_be/_becoming,
\v 23 the \nd Messiah\nd* if suffering, if first by resurrection ˱from˲_/the/_dead, /is/_going /to_be/_proclaiming light - both ˱to˲_/the/_people and the pagans.”
\v 24 ¶ And ˱of˲_him defending these \add things\add*, - Festus ˱with˲_loud - voice /is/_saying, “˱You˲_/are/_raving_mad, Paul! The great learning /is/_turning you to madness!”
\v 25 But - Paul, “/Is/_saying ˱I˲_/am/_=> not <=_raving_mad”, “most_excellent Festus, but ˱I˲_/am/_speaking_out words ˱of˲_truth and sobriety.
\v 26 For the king /is/_understanding concerning these \add things\add*, to whom ˱I˲_/am/_=> also <=_speaking speaking_boldly; for ˱I˲_/am_being/_persuaded nothing /to_be/_escaping_notice him anything ˱of˲_these \add things\add* not, for this is not /having_been/_done in /a/_corner.
\v 27 King Agrippa /are/_˱you˲_believing, ˱in˲_the prophets? ˱I˲_/have/_known that ˱you˲_/are/_believing.”
\v 28 And - Agrippa \add said\add* to - Paul, “/Are/_˱you˲_persuading me in /a/_little \add time\add* /to/_make /a/_Christian?”
\v 29 And - Paul \add said\add*, “˱I˲_/might/_hope - - ˱to˲_\nd God\nd*, both in /a/_little \add time\add* and in /a/_great \add time\add*, not only you, but also all the \add ones\add* hearing ˱from˲_me today, /to/_become such what_kind also_I am, except - ˱of˲_> these <_bonds.”
\v 30 both the king and the governor ¶ Stood_up, - both Bernice and the \add ones\add* sitting_with ˱with˲_them,
\v 31 and /having/_withdrawn ˱they˲_/were/_speaking to one_another saying, - “This - man any not_one worthy \add thing\add* ˱of˲_death or ˱of˲_bonds /is/_doing.”
\v 32 And Agrippa /was/_saying - ˱to˲_Festus, “This - man /was/_able /to_have/_sent_away, except - ˱he˲_/had/_appealed Caesar.”
\c 27
\v 1 ¶ And when ˱it˲_/was/_judged - us /to_be/_sailing_away to - Italy, ˱they˲_/were/_giving_over - both Paul and some other prisoners, ˱to˲_/a/_centurion ˱by˲_/the/_name Julius, ˱of˲_/the/_cohort ˱of˲_Augustus.
\v 2 And /having/_boarded ˱on˲_/a/_=> Adramyttium <=_ship, ˱we˲_/were/_launched going /to_be/_sailing to the places along - Asia, ˱of˲_Aristarchus being with us, /a/_Macedonian ˱of˲_Thessalonian.
\v 3 Both ˱on˲_the next \add day\add* ˱we˲_/were/_set_down at Sidon, and - Julius /having/_given_treatment with_human_kindness - ˱to˲_Paul, ˱he˲_permitted \add him\add* /having_been/_gone to his friends, /to/_obtain ˱of˲_care.
\v 4 And_from_there /having_been/_launched, ˱we˲_sailed_under - Cyprus, because_of that the winds to_be contrary.
\v 5 And /having/_sailed_across the sea - along - Cilicia and Pamphylia, ˱we˲_came_down to Myra - ˱of˲_Lycia.
\v 6 And_there the centurion /having/_found /a/_=> Alexandrian <=_ship, sailing to - Italy, ˱he˲_placed_in us into it.
\v 7 And in many days, slow_sailing and with_difficulty, /having/_become along - Cnidus, the wind not further_permitting us, ˱we˲_sailed_under - Crete along Salmone.
\v 8 And sailing_along it with_difficulty, ˱we˲_came to /a/_=> certain <=_place /being/_called Beautiful Harbors, ˱to˲_which was near /the/_city Lasaea.
\v 9 ¶ And much time /having/_elapsed, and the voyage already being dangerous, because_of that even the fasting already /to_have/_passed_by, - Paul /was/_advising \add them\add*
\v 10 saying ˱to˲_them, “Men, ˱I˲_/am/_perceiving that the voyage /to_be/_going going_to_be with damage and much loss, not only ˱of˲_the cargo and ˱to˲_the ship, but also the lives ˱of˲_us.”
\v 11 But the centurion /was_being/_persuaded ˱by˲_the captain and the ship_owner rather, than ˱by˲_the \add things\add* /being/_spoken by Paul.
\v 12 And the harbor being unsuitable to winter, the more presented /a/_counsel /to_be/_launched from_there, if somehow ˱they˲_/might_be/_able, /having/_arrived at Phoenix, /to/_winter /a/_harbor - ˱of˲_Crete, looking to /the/_southwest and to /the/_northwest.
\v 13 ¶ And ¶ ˱of˲_/a/_south_wind /having/_blown_gently, /having/_supposed ˱of˲_the purpose /to_have/_taken_hold, /having/_taken_up ˱they˲_/were/_sailing_along near - Crete.
\v 14 But after not much \add time\add*, /a/_=> typhoon <=_wind, - /being/_called /the/_Euraquilo cast down. ˱from˲_it.
\v 15 And the ship /having_been/_seized, and not being_able /to_be/_facing ˱to˲_the wind, /having/_given_up ˱we˲_/were_being/_driven_along.
\v 16 And /having/_run_under /a/_certain island /being/_called Clauda, ˱we˲_were_able with_difficulty /to/_become control ˱of˲_the lifeboat,
\v 17 which /having/_taken_up, ˱they˲_/were/_resorting ˱to˲_helps, undergirding the ship. And fearing lest ˱they˲_/may/_run_aground into the \add shallows_of\add* Syrtis, /having/_lowered the gear, thus ˱they˲_/were_being/_driven_along.
\v 18 And ˱of˲_us /being/_=> violently <=_storm_tossed, ˱on˲_the_> next <_\add day\add* ˱they˲_/were/_making /a/_jettison,
\v 19 and ˱on˲_the third \add day\add*, ˱they˲_threw_down the tackle ˱of˲_the ship /their/_own_hands.
\v 20 And neither sun nor stars appearing for more days, and no little storm laying_on \add us\add*, furthermore all hope, - us /to_be_being/_saved /was_being/_taken_away.
\v 21 ¶ And ˱of˲_much abstinence being, then - Paul /having_been/_stood in midst ˱of˲_them said, “˱It˲_/was/_fitting indeed, O men, /having/_yielded ˱to˲_me, not /to_be_being/_launched from - Crete, and /to/_gain - this damage, and the loss.
\v 22 And_yet now ˱I˲_/am/_advising you_all the \add things\add* /to_be/_cheering_up, for not_one loss ˱of˲_life will_be of you_all, except ˱of˲_the ship.
\v 23 For /an/_angel - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd* stood_by me this - night, ˱of˲_whose ˱I˲_am, ˱unto˲_whom also ˱I˲_/am/_serving,
\v 24 saying, ‘/Be/_=> not <=_fearing, Paul; ˱it˲_/is/_fitting you /to/_stand_before ˱before˲_Caesar, and behold, - \nd God\nd* /has/_granted ˱to˲_you all the \add ones\add* sailing with you.’
\v 25 Therefore /be/_cheering_up, men, for ˱I˲_/am/_believing ˱in˲_- \nd God\nd* that thus ˱it˲_will_be, according_to which manner ˱it˲_/has_been/_spoken ˱to˲_me.
\v 26 But ˱it˲_/is/_fitting us /to/_run_aground on /a/_certain island.”
\v 27 ¶ But when /the/_fourteenth night became, us /being/_carried_through in the Adriatic_Sea, to /the/_middle ˱of˲_the night, the sailors /were/_suspecting /a/_certain /to_be/_coming_near ˱to˲_them land.
\v 28 And /having/_taken_soundings, ˱they˲_found twenty fathoms, and /a/_little \add time\add* /having/_passed_by, and again /having/_taken_soundings, ˱they˲_found fifteen fathoms.
\v 29 And fearing lest ˱we˲_/may/_run_aground somewhere on rough places, /having/_thrown_down four anchors from /the/_stern, ˱they˲_/were/_hoping ˱for˲_day /to/_become.
\v 30 And - /the/_sailors seeking /to/_flee out_of the ship, and /having/_lowered the lifeboat into the sea, ˱on˲_under_pretense as going /to_be/_stretching_out anchors from /the/_bow,
\v 31 - Paul said ˱to˲_the centurion and ˱to˲_the soldiers, “If these /may/_=> not <=_remain in the ship, you_all /are/_=> not <=_being_able /to_be/_saved.”
\v 32 Then the soldiers cut_off the ropes ˱of˲_the lifeboat, and ˱they˲_allowed her /to/_run_aground.
\v 33 ¶ And until ˱of˲_which day /was/_going /to_be/_becoming, - Paul /was/_exhorting all, /to/_partake ˱of˲_food saying, “Today /the/_fourteenth day \add is\add*, ˱you_all˲_/are/_continuing waiting foodless, /having/_taken nothing.
\v 34 Therefore ˱I˲_/am/_exhorting you_all /to/_partake ˱of˲_food, for this /is/_being for - your salvation; for /a/_hair from the head ˱of˲_no_one ˱of˲_you_all /will_be/_perishing.”
\v 35 And /having/_said these \add things\add*, and /having/_taken bread, ˱he˲_gave_thanks - ˱to˲_\nd God\nd* before all, and /having/_broke \add it\add*, ˱he˲_began /to_be/_eating.
\v 36 And all /having/_become cheerful, they also received ˱of˲_food.
\v 37 And ˱we˲_were - all souls in the ship, two_hundred seventy six.
\v 38 And /having_been/_satiated ˱of˲_food, ˱they˲_/were/_lightening the ship, casting_out the wheat into the sea.
\v 39 ¶ And when day became, ˱they˲_/were/_=> not <=_recognizing the land, but /were/_observing /a/_certain bay having /a/_shore, on which ˱they˲_/were/_counselling, if ˱they˲_/might_be/_able /to/_preserve the ship.
\v 40 And /having/_cut_away the anchors, ˱they˲_/were/_allowing \add them\add* in the sea, at_once /having/_unfastened the ropes ˱of˲_the rudders, and /having/_lifted_up the foresail ˱to˲_the \add wind\add* blowing, ˱they˲_/were/_keeping for the shore.
\v 41 But /having/_fallen_among into /a/_place two_sea, ˱they˲_ran_ the ship _aground, and on_one_hand the bow /having/_stuck remained unshakeable, on_the_other_hand the stern /was_being/_destroyed by the force.
\v 42 And ˱of˲_the soldiers, /the/_counsel became that ˱they˲_/may/_kill_off the prisoners, lest anyone /having/_swum_away /may/_escape.
\v 43 But the centurion wishing /to/_bring_ - Paul _safely_through, forbade them ˱of˲_their counsel, and ˱he˲_commanded the \add ones\add* being_able /to_be/_swimming, /having/_thrown_off \add themselves\add* first, /to_be/_departing on the land,
\v 44 and the rest, on_one_hand some on planks, on_the_other_hand some on some \add things\add* - from the ship. And thus ˱it˲_became, all /to_be/_brought_safely_through to the land.
\c 28
\v 1 ¶ And /having_been/_brought_safely_through, then ˱we˲_learned that the island /is_being/_called Melita.
\v 2 And the foreigners /were/_bringing_about not \add just\add* the /having/_been_ordinary human_kindness ˱to˲_us, for /having/_lit /a/_fire, ˱they˲_received all us, because_of the rain - /having/_approached, and because_of the cold.
\v 3 But - Paul /having/_gathered some multitude ˱of˲_sticks, and /having/_laid_on \add them\add* on the fire, /a/_viper /having/_come_out from the heat, clamped_down ˱on˲_the hand ˱of˲_him.
\v 4 And when the foreigners saw the wild_beast being_hanged from the hand ˱of˲_him, ˱they˲_/were/_saying to one_another, “Certainly this - man is /a/_murderer, whom /having_been/_brought_safely_through from the sea, - justice not allowed \add him\add* /to_be/_living.”
\v 5 Therefore indeed he, /having/_shaken_off the wild_beast into the fire, suffered not_one harm.
\v 6 But they /were/_expecting him /to_be/_going /to_be_being/_swelled_up, or /to_be/_falling_down suddenly dead. But over much \add time\add*, them waiting and observing nothing amiss becoming to him, /having/_changed_their_minds ˱they˲_/were/_saying him to_be /a/_god.
\v 7 ¶ And in the \add parts\add* about - that place, /was/_being properties ˱to˲_the leader ˱of˲_the island ˱by˲_/the/_name Publius, who /having/_accepted us hospitably lodged three days.
\v 8 And ˱it˲_became, the father - ˱of˲_Publius /to_be/_lying_down /being/_gripped_with ˱with˲_fevers and dysentery, to whom - Paul /having/_come_in, and /having/_prayed, /having/_laid_on the hands ˱on˲_him, ˱he˲_healed him.
\v 9 And this /having/_become, also the rest - in the island having sicknesses /were/_approaching and /were_being/_healed,
\v 10 who also ˱they˲_honored us ˱with˲_many honors, and /being/_launched, ˱they˲_laid_on the \add things\add* for our needs.
\v 11 ¶ And after three months, ˱we˲_/were/_launched in /a/_ship /having/_wintered in the island, /an/_Alexandrian ˱with˲_/a/_figurehead ˱to˲_Zeus_twins.
\v 12 And /having_been/_set_down at Syracuse, ˱we˲_remained_on three days,
\v 13 whence /having/_cut_away, ˱we˲_arrived at Rhegium. And after one day, /having/_come_on /a/_south_wind, /the/_second \add day\add* ˱we˲_came to Puteoli,
\v 14 where /having/_found /the/_brothers, ˱we˲_/were/_implored by them /to/_remain_on seven days. And thus ˱we˲_came to - Rome.
\v 15 And_from_there the brothers /having/_heard, the \add things\add* concerning us, came to meeting ˱with˲_us until Appius Market and Three Taverns, whom - Paul /having/_seen, /having/_giving_thanks - ˱to˲_\nd God\nd*, took courage.
\v 16 ¶ And when ˱we˲_came_in to Rome, ˱it˲_/was/_permitted - ˱to˲_Paul /to_be/_remaining by himself, with the soldier guarding him.
\v 17 ¶ And ˱it˲_became after three days, him /to/_call_together the \add ones\add* being leaders ˱of˲_the Jews. And them /having/_come_together, ˱he˲_/was/_saying to them, “Men brothers I, /having/_done nothing contrary ˱to˲_the people or the - ancestral customs, /a/_prisoner from Jerusalem /was/_given_over into the hands ˱of˲_the Romans,
\v 18 who /having/_examined me, /were/_wishing /to/_send_away \add me\add*, because_of that not_one cause ˱of˲_death /to_be/_being in me.
\v 19 But speaking_against ˱of˲_the Jews, ˱I˲_/was/_compelled /to/_appeal ˱to˲_Caesar, not as having anything /to_be/_accusing ˱against˲_the nation ˱of˲_me.
\v 20 Therefore for this - cause, ˱I˲_begged you_all, /to/_see and /to/_address, for on_account ˱of˲_the hope - ˱of˲_Israel, this - chain ˱I˲_/am_being/_encompassed \add in\add*.”
\v 21 And they said to him, “We neither received letters concerning you from - Judea, nor /having/_arrived anyone ˱of˲_the brothers reported or spoke anything evil concerning you.
\v 22 But ˱we˲_/are/_considering_worthy /to/_hear from you what ˱you˲_/are/_thinking, for indeed concerning - this sect ˱it˲_is known ˱to˲_us, that ˱it˲_/is_being/_spoken_against everywhere.”
\v 23 ¶ And /having/_determined /a/_day ˱for˲_him, more ˱they˲_came to him to the lodging, ˱to˲_whom ˱he˲_/was/_explaining, testifying the Kingdom - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*, and persuading them concerning - \nd Jesus\nd*, from both the law ˱of˲_Moses, and the prophets, from in_the_morning to evening.
\v 24 And on_one_hand the \add ones\add* /were_being/_persuaded ˱by˲_the \add things\add* /being/_spoken, on_the_other_hand the \add ones\add* /were/_disbelieving.
\v 25 And being discordant with one_another, ˱they˲_/were/_sending_away, - Paul /having/_spoken one \add final\add* word: - “Rightly the - Holy \nd Spirit\nd* spoke by Isaiah the prophet to the fathers ˱of˲_you_all
\v 26 saying, ‘/be/_gone to - this people, and say, “˱In˲_hearing ˱you_all˲_/will_be/_hearing, and by_no_means ˱you_all˲_/may/_=> not <=_understand, and seeing ˱you_all˲_/will_be/_seeing, and by_no_means ˱you_all˲_/may/_=> not <=_perceive.
\v 27 For the heart - ˱of˲_> this <_people /was/_become_dull, and ˱they˲_> hardly <_heard ˱with˲_their ears ˱of˲_them, and ˱they˲_shut the eyes ˱of˲_them, lest ˱they˲_/may/_see ˱with˲_their eyes, and ˱they˲_/may/_hear ˱with˲_their ears, and ˱they˲_/may/_understand ˱with˲_their heart, and ˱they˲_/may/_turn_back, and ˱I˲_/will_be/_healing them.”’
\v 28 Therefore ˱it˲_let_be known, ˱to˲_you_all that this - salvation - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd* /was/_sent_out ˱to˲_the pagans, and they /will_be/_hearing!”
\v 29
\v 30 ¶ And ¶ ˱He˲_remained_in two_ whole _years in /his/_own rental, and /was/_welcoming all the \add ones\add* entering_in to him,
\v 31 proclaiming the Kingdom - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*, and unhinderedly teaching the \add things\add* concerning the \nd Lord\nd* \nd Jesus\nd* \nd Christ\nd*, with all boldness.
