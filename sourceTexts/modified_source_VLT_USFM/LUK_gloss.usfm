\v 1 ¶ Since many attempted /to/_draw_up /a/_description, concerning the matters /having_been/_fully_assured among us,
\v 2 as the \add ones\add* from /the/_beginning, /having/_become eyewitnesses and attendants ˱of˲_the word gave_ \add them\add* _over ˱to˲_us,
\v 3 ˱it˲_supposed ˱to˲_also_me /having/_followed originally ˱with˲_all \add things\add* exactly, consecutively /to/_write ˱to˲_you, most_excellent Theophilus,
\v 4 in_order_that ˱you˲_/may/_know the certainty concerning which ˱of˲_/the/_words ˱you˲_/were/_instructed.
\v 5 ¶ ˱It˲_became in the days ˱of˲_Herod king - ˱of˲_Judea, /a/_=> certain <=_priest ˱by˲_/the/_name Zacharias of division ˱of˲_Abijah, and wife ˱to˲_him of the daughters ˱of˲_Aaron, and the name ˱of˲_her, Elizabeth.
\v 6 And ˱they˲_were both righteous before - \nd God\nd*, blameless in pursuing all the commandments and just_acts ˱of˲_the \nd Lord\nd*.
\v 7 And was ˱to˲_them no child, as_much_as - Elizabeth was barren, and both were /having/_advanced in the days ˱of˲_them.
\v 8 ¶ And ˱it˲_became in the \add time\add* him /to_be/_ministering, before - \nd God\nd* in the order ˱of˲_the division ˱of˲_him,
\v 9 according_to the custom ˱of˲_the priestly_office, ˱he˲_was_chosen_by_lot - /to/_burn_incense, /having/_come_in into the temple ˱of˲_the \nd Lord\nd*.
\v 10 And all the multitude ˱of˲_the people was praying outside ˱at˲_the hour ˱of˲_the incense.
\v 11 And /an/_angel ˱of˲_/the/_\nd Lord\nd* /was/_seen ˱to˲_him, /having/_stood on /the/_right ˱of˲_the altar ˱of˲_the incense.
\v 12 And Zacharias /was/_disturbed /having/_seen \add him\add*, and fear fell_on on him.
\v 13 But the angel said to him, “/Be/_=> not <=_fearing, Zacharias, because the petition ˱of˲_you /was/_listened_to, and Elizabeth the wife ˱of˲_you /will_be/_bearing /a/_son ˱to˲_you, and ˱you˲_/will_be/_calling the name ˱of˲_him John.
\v 14 And will_be joy and exultation ˱to˲_you, and many /will_be_being/_elated at the birth ˱of˲_him.
\v 15 For ˱he˲_will_be great before the \nd Lord\nd*, and by_no_means ˱he˲_/may/_=> not <=_drink wine and liquor, and ˱he˲_/will_be_being/_filled ˱of˲_/the/_=> Holy <=_\nd Spirit\nd* still from /the/_womb ˱of˲_/the/_mother ˱of˲_him.
\v 16 And ˱he˲_/will_be/_turning_back many ˱of˲_the sons ˱of˲_Israel to /the/_\nd Lord\nd*, the \nd God\nd* ˱of˲_them.
\v 17 And he /will_be/_going_ahead before him in /the/_spirit and power ˱with˲_Elijah, /to/_turn_back /the/_hearts ˱of˲_/the/_fathers to /the/_children, and /the/_unpersuadable in /the/_understanding ˱of˲_/the/_righteous, /to/_prepare ˱for˲_/the/_\nd Lord\nd* /a/_people /having_been/_prepared.”
\v 18 And Zacharias said to the angel, “By what /will_˱I˲_/be_knowing this? For I am /an/_older_man, and the wife ˱of˲_me /having/_advanced in the days ˱of˲_her.”
\v 19 And answering the angel said ˱to˲_him, “I am Gabriel, the \add one\add* /having/_stood_by before - \nd God\nd*, and ˱I˲_/was/_sent_out /to/_speak to you, and /to/_gospel_preach these \add things\add* ˱to˲_you.
\v 20 And behold, ˱you˲_will_be keeping_silent and not being_able /to/_speak, until that day these \add things\add* /may/_become, for that ˱you˲_> not <_believed ˱in˲_the words ˱of˲_me, which /will_be_being/_fulfilled in the season ˱of˲_them.”
\v 21 ¶ And the people was expecting - Zacharias, and ˱they˲_/were/_marveling at the \add time\add* /to_be/_delaying him in the temple.
\v 22 But /having/_come_out ˱he˲_/was/_=> not <=_able /to/_speak ˱to˲_them, and ˱they˲_recognized that ˱he˲_/has/_seen /a/_vision in the temple. And he was nodding ˱to˲_them, and /was/_continuing mute.
\v 23 And ˱it˲_became when the days ˱of˲_the ministry ˱of˲_him /were/_fulfilled, ˱he˲_went_away to the home ˱of˲_him.
\v 24 ¶ And after these - days Elizabeth the wife ˱of˲_him conceived, and /was/_secluding herself five months saying,
\v 25 - “Thus /the/_\nd Lord\nd* /has/_done ˱to˲_me, in /the/_days ˱in˲_which ˱he˲_looked_upon, /to/_take_away /the/_disgrace ˱of˲_me among people.”
\v 26 ¶ And in the the sixth month, the angel Gabriel /was/_sent_out by - \nd God\nd* to /a/_city - ˱of˲_Galilee, ˱to˲_whose name \add was\add* Nazareth,
\v 27 to /a/_virgin /having_been/_betrothed ˱to˲_/a/_man, whose name \add was\add* Joseph, of /the/_house ˱of˲_David, and the name ˱of˲_the virgin \add was\add* Mary.
\v 28 And /having/_come_in the angel to her, said, “Hail, /having_been/_favored! The \nd Lord\nd* \add is\add* with you.”
\v 29 And she /was/_thoroughly_perplexed at the statement, and /was/_reasoning what_kind_of - greeting this might_be.
\v 30 And the angel said ˱to˲_her, “/Be/_=> not <=_fearing, Mary, for ˱you˲_found favor with - \nd God\nd*.
\v 31 And behold, ˱you˲_/will_be/_conceiving in ˱your˲_womb, and ˱you˲_/will_be/_bearing /a/_son, and ˱you˲_/will_be/_calling the name ˱of˲_him \nd Jesus\nd*.
\v 32 This \add one\add* will_be great, and /will_be_being/_called /the/_Son ˱of˲_/the/_Highest, and /the/_\nd Lord\nd* - \nd God\nd* /will_be/_giving ˱to˲_him the throne ˱of˲_David, the father ˱of˲_him,
\v 33 and ˱he˲_/will_be/_reigning over the house ˱of˲_Jacob, to the ages, and ˱of˲_the kingdom ˱of˲_him, will_ not _be /an/_end.”
\v 34 And said Mary to the angel, “How will_ this _be, because ˱I˲_/am/_=> not <=_knowing /a/_man?”
\v 35 And answering the angel said ˱to˲_her, “/The/_=> Holy <=_\nd Spirit\nd* /will_be/_coming_over on you, and /the/_power ˱of˲_/the/_Highest /will_be/_overshadowing ˱on˲_you; therefore also the Holy \add child\add* /being/_born /will_be_being/_called, Son ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*.
\v 36 And behold, Elizabeth, the relative ˱of˲_you, she also /has/_conceived /a/_son in /the/_old_age ˱of˲_her, and this is sixth month ˱to˲_her who \add was\add* /being/_called barren.
\v 37 Because every word /will_ not _be/_unattaining with - \nd God\nd*.”
\v 38 And Mary said, “Behold, the handmaiden ˱of˲_/the/_\nd Lord\nd*; /might/_˱it˲_become ˱to˲_me according_to the word ˱of˲_you.” And the angel went_away from her.
\v 39 ¶ And Mary /having/_risen_up in - these days, /was/_gone into the mountainous with earnestness, to /a/_city ˱of˲_Judah,
\v 40 and ˱she˲_came_in into the house ˱of˲_Zacharias, and greeted - Elizabeth.
\v 41 And ˱it˲_became, as - Elizabeth heard the greeting - ˱of˲_Mary, the baby kicked in the womb ˱of˲_her, and - Elizabeth /was/_filled ˱with˲_/the/_=> Holy <=_\nd Spirit\nd*,
\v 42 and ˱she˲_cried_out ˱with˲_/a/_=> loud <=_voice and said, “You /having_been/_blessed among women, and the fruit ˱of˲_the womb ˱of˲_you /having_been/_blessed.
\v 43 And from_where this ˱to˲_me, that the mother ˱of˲_the \nd Lord\nd* ˱of˲_me /may/_come to me?
\v 44 For behold, as the voice ˱of˲_the greeting ˱of˲_you became into the ears ˱of˲_me, the baby in the womb ˱of˲_me kicked in. exultation.
\v 45 And blessed \add is\add* the \add woman\add* /having/_believed that ˱there˲_will_be /a/_completion ˱to˲_the \add things\add* /having_been/_spoken ˱to˲_her from /the/_\nd Lord\nd*.”
\v 46 ¶ And Mary said: “The soul ˱of˲_me /is/_magnifying the \nd Lord\nd*,
\v 47 and the spirit ˱of˲_me exulted in - \nd God\nd*, the Savior ˱of˲_me.
\v 48 Because ˱he˲_looked_at on the humiliation ˱of˲_the handmaiden ˱of˲_him. For behold, from the \add time\add* now all the generations /will_be/_counting_ me _blessed.
\v 49 Because the powerful \add one\add* did great \add things\add* ˱to˲_me, and the name ˱of˲_him \add is\add* holy.
\v 50 ‘And the mercy ˱of˲_him \add is\add* to generations and generations, ˱to˲_the \add ones\add* revering him.’
\v 51 ˱He˲_did power with /the/_arm ˱of˲_him, /the/_proud ˱in˲_/the/_mind ˱of˲_heart ˱of˲_them ˱he˲_scattered.
\v 52 ˱He˲_took_down sovereigns from thrones, and exalted /the/_humble.
\v 53 ‘˱He˲_filled hungering \add ones\add* ˱with˲_good \add things\add*’, and ˱he˲_sent_away being_rich \add ones\add* empty-handed.
\v 54 ˱He˲_took_care ˱of˲_Israel servant ˱of˲_him, /to_be/_reminded ˱of˲_mercy,
\v 55 as ˱he˲_spoke to the fathers ˱of˲_us, - ˱to˲_Abraham and ˱to˲_the descendants ˱of˲_him, for the age.”
\v 56 And Mary remained with her about three months, and returned to the home ˱of˲_her.
\v 57 ¶ And - ˱to˲_Elizabeth /was/_fulfilled the time, - her /to/_bear, and ˱she˲_bore /a/_son.
\v 58 And the neighbors and the relatives ˱of˲_her heard that /the/_\nd Lord\nd* magnified the mercy ˱of˲_him with her, and ˱they˲_/were/_rejoicing_with ˱with˲_her.
\v 59 And ˱it˲_became on the - eighth day, ˱they˲_came /to/_circumcise the little_child, and ˱they˲_/were/_calling it Zacharias after the name ˱of˲_the father ˱of˲_him.
\v 60 And /having_been/_answering the mother ˱of˲_him said, “No, but ˱he˲_/will_be_being/_called John.”
\v 61 And ˱they˲_said to her, - “No_one is of the relatives ˱of˲_you, who /is_being/_called - ˱by˲_> this <_name.”
\v 62 And ˱they˲_/were/_signaling ˱to˲_the father ˱of˲_him, what the \add name\add* - ˱he˲_/might_be/_wanting him /to_be_being/_called.
\v 63 And /having/_requested /a/_tablet, ˱he˲_wrote saying, “John is /the/_name ˱of˲_him.” And all marveled.
\v 64 And the mouth ˱of˲_him /was/_opened_up immediately, and the tongue ˱of˲_him, and ˱he˲_/was/_speaking blessing - \nd God\nd*.
\v 65 And fear became on all, the \add ones\add* dwelling_around them, and in all the mountainous \add area\add* - ˱of˲_Judea all - these words. /was_being/_discussed.
\v 66 And all the \add ones\add* /having/_heard put in the heart themselves saying, “What consequently the this little_child will_be?” For also /the/_hand ˱of˲_/the/_\nd Lord\nd* was with him.
\v 67 ¶ And Zacharias the father ˱of˲_him, /was/_filled ˱with˲_/the/_=> Holy <=_\nd Spirit\nd* and prophesied saying,
\v 68 “Blessed \add is\add* /the/_\nd Lord\nd* the \nd God\nd* - ˱of˲_Israel, because ˱he˲_visited and established redemption ˱for˲_the people ˱of˲_him,
\v 69 and raised /a/_horn ˱of˲_salvation ˱for˲_us, in /the/_house ˱of˲_David, /the/_servant ˱of˲_him,

\v 12 And this \add is\add* the sign ˱to˲_you_all: ˱you_all˲_/will_be/_finding /a/_baby /having_been/_swaddled, and lying in /a/_manger.”
\v 13 And suddenly /a/_multitude ˱of˲_/the/_=> heavenly <=_army became with the angel, praising - \nd God\nd* and saying,
\v 14 “Glory ˱to˲_\nd God\nd* in /the/_highest, and peace on earth among humans ˱with˲_good_pleasure!”
\v 15 ¶ And ˱it˲_became as the angels went_away from them into - heaven, the shepherds /were/_saying to one_another, “˱We˲_/may/_=> indeed <=_pass_through as_far_as Bethlehem, and ˱we˲_/may/_see - word this the \add thing\add* /having/_become, which the \nd Lord\nd* made_known ˱to˲_us.”
\v 16 And came /having/_hurried, and sought_out - both Mary and - Joseph, and the baby, lying in the manger.
\v 17 And /having/_seen, ˱they˲_made_known concerning the saying - /having_been/_spoken ˱to˲_them, concerning - this little_child.
\v 18 And all the \add ones\add* /having/_heard, marveled concerning the \add things\add* /having_been/_spoken by the shepherds to them.
\v 19 But - Mary /was/_treasuring all - these words, considering \add them\add* in the heart ˱of˲_her.
\v 20 And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising - \nd God\nd* for all \add things\add* which ˱they˲_heard and saw, as /was/_spoken to them.

\v 29 “Now ˱you˲_/are/_sending_away the slave ˱of˲_you, Master, in peace according_to the word ˱of˲_you;
\v 30 because the eyes ˱of˲_me saw the salvation ˱of˲_you,
\v 31 which ˱you˲_prepared in /the/_face ˱of˲_all the peoples,
\v 32 ‘/a/_light for revelation ˱of˲_/the/_pagans’ and glory ˱of˲_/the/_people ˱of˲_you, Israel.”
\v 33 And the father ˱of˲_him and the mother was marveling at the \add things\add* /being/_spoken concerning him.
\v 34 And Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary the mother ˱of˲_him, “Behold, this \add one\add* /is/_appointing for /the/_fall and /the/_resurrection ˱of˲_many in - Israel, and for /a/_sign /being/_spoken_against,

\v 36 ¶ And Anna was /a/_prophetess, daughter ˱of˲_Phanuel, of /the/_tribe ˱of˲_Aser; this \add woman\add* /having/_advanced in great days, /having/_lived with /a/_husband seven years from the virginity ˱of˲_her,

\v 1 ¶ And in /the/_=> fifteenth <=_year ˱of˲_the government ˱of˲_Tiberias Caesar, Pontius Pilate \add was\add* governing - ˱of˲_Judea, and Herod being_tetrarch - ˱of˲_Galilee, And Philip the brother ˱of˲_him being_tetrarch - ˱of˲_Iturea and Trachonitis region, and Lysanias - being_tetrarch ˱of˲_Abilene,
\v 2 during /the/_chief_priest ˱of˲_Annas and Caiaphas, /the/_word ˱of˲_\nd God\nd* became on John, the ˱of˲_Zacharias son, in the desert.
\v 3 And ˱he˲_came into all /the/_surrounding_region ˱of˲_the Jordan, proclaiming /a/_baptism ˱of˲_repentance for forgiveness ˱of˲_sins,
\v 4 as ˱it˲_/has_been/_written in /the/_scroll ˱of˲_/the/_words ˱of˲_Isaiah the prophet, “/the/_voice shouting in the desert: ‘Prepare the way ˱of˲_/the/_\nd Lord\nd*, /be/_making the paths ˱of˲_him straight.
\v 5 Every valley /will_be_being/_filled, and every mountain and hill /will_be_being/_brought_low, and the crooked will_be into straight, and the rough ways into smooth;
\v 6 and all flesh /will_be/_seeing the salvation - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*.’”
\v 7 ¶ Therefore ˱he˲_/was/_saying ˱to˲_the crowds going_out /to_be/_baptized by him, “Brood ˱of˲_vipers, who warned ˱to˲_you_all /to/_flee from the coming wrath?
\v 8 Therefore produce fruits worthy - ˱of˲_repentance; and ˱you_all˲_/may/_=> not <=_begin /to_be/_saying in yourselves, ˱we˲_/are/_having - Abraham ‘˱As˲_father’, for ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all that - \nd God\nd* /is/_able /to/_raise children - ˱to˲_Abraham from - these stones.
\v 9 And already also the axe /is/_lying to the root ˱of˲_the trees; therefore every tree not producing good fruit, /is_being/_cut_off and /is_being/_cast into /the/_fire.”
\v 10 ¶ And the crowds /were/_asking him saying, “Therefore what /may/_˱we˲_do?”
\v 11 And answering ˱he˲_/was/_saying ˱to˲_them, “The \add one\add* having two tunics, /let/_share ˱to˲_the \add one\add* not having, and the \add one\add* having foods, likewise /let_be/_doing.”
\v 12 And tax_collectors also came /to_be/_baptized, and ˱they˲_said to him, “Teacher, what /may/_˱we˲_do?”
\v 13 And he said to them, “/Be/_collecting nothing more beside the \add thing\add* /having_been/_directed ˱to˲_you_all.”
\v 14 And also /the/_soldiering \add ones\add* /were/_asking him saying, “What /may/_=> we <=_do also?” And ˱he˲_said ˱to˲_them, “˱You_all˲_/may/_accost no_one nor ˱you_all˲_/may/_falsely_accuse, and /be_being/_sufficed ˱for˲_the wages ˱of˲_you_all.”
\v 15 ¶ And the people expecting and reasoning all in the hearts ˱of˲_them concerning - John, whether he might_be the \nd Messiah\nd*,
\v 16 - John answered saying ˱to˲_all, “I on_one_hand /am/_baptizing you_all ˱in˲_water, on_the_other_hand the \add one\add* mightier \add than\add* me /is/_coming, ˱of˲_whom not ˱I˲_am worthy /to/_untie the strap ˱of˲_the sandals ˱of˲_him; he /will_be/_baptizing you_all with /the/_=> Holy <=_\nd Spirit\nd*, and ˱with˲_fire;

\v 18 ¶ Therefore also exhorting many other \add things\add* indeed, ˱he˲_/was/_gospel_preaching ˱to˲_the people.
\v 19 But - Herod the tetrarch, /being/_rebuked by him concerning Herodias, the wife ˱of˲_the brother ˱of˲_him, and concerning all evil which - Herod did,
\v 20 also added this to all: ˱he˲_locked_up - John in prison.
\v 21 ¶ And ˱it˲_became that with all the people /to_be/_baptized, and \nd Jesus\nd* /having_been/_baptized, and praying - heaven /to_be/_opened_up,

\v 3 And the devil said ˱to˲_him, “If ˱you˲_are /the/_Son - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*, say - ˱to˲_> this <_stone that ˱it˲_/may/_become bread.”
\v 4 And - \nd Jesus\nd* answered to him, “˱It˲_/has_been/_written, - ‘the person only not on bread /will_be/_living.’”
\v 5 ¶ And /having/_brought_ him _up ˱he˲_showed ˱to˲_him all the kingdoms ˱of˲_the inhabited_world in /a/_moment ˱of˲_time.
\v 6 And the devil said ˱to˲_him, “˱I˲_/will_be/_giving ˱to˲_you - all this domain and the glory ˱of˲_them, because /has_been/_given_over ˱to˲_me and ˱I˲_/am/_giving it ˱to˲_whom - ˱I˲_/may_be/_wanting.
\v 7 Therefore if you ˱you˲_/may/_worship before me, all will_be ˱of˲_you.”
\v 8 And - \nd Jesus\nd* answering said ˱to˲_him, “˱It˲_/has_been/_written, ˱you˲_/will_be/_worshipping /the/_\nd Lord\nd* - \nd God\nd* ‘˱of˲_you and only ˱unto˲_him ˱you˲_/will_be/_serving.’”
\v 9 ¶ And ˱he˲_led him to Jerusalem, and stood on the pinnacle ˱of˲_the temple, and ˱he˲_said ˱to˲_him, “If ˱you˲_are /the/_Son - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*, cast yourself down from_here;
\v 10 for ˱it˲_/has_been/_written, - ‘˱he˲_/will_be/_commanding ˱to˲_the angels ˱of˲_him concerning you, - /to/_guard you’,

\v 12 And answering - \nd Jesus\nd* said ˱to˲_him, - “˱It˲_/has_been/_said, ‘˱you˲_/will_ not _be/_testing /the/_\nd Lord\nd* the \nd God\nd* ˱of˲_you.’”
\v 13 And /having/_completed every temptation, the devil withdrew from him until /a/_season.
\v 14 ¶ And - \nd Jesus\nd* returned in the power ˱of˲_the \nd Spirit\nd* to - Galilee. And /a/_news came_out to all the surrounding_region concerning him.
\v 15 And he /was/_teaching in the synagogues ˱of˲_them, /being/_glorified by all.
\v 16 ¶ And ˱he˲_came to Nazareth, where ˱he˲_was /having_been/_brought_up, and ˱he˲_came_in according_to that /having/_been_accustomed ˱to˲_him, on the day ˱of˲_the Sabbaths into the synagogue, and ˱he˲_stood_up /to/_read.
\v 17 And /the/_scroll ˱of˲_the prophet Isaiah /was/_handed_out ˱to˲_him, and /having/_opened_up the scroll, ˱he˲_found the place where ˱it˲_was /having_been/_written,
\v 18 “/the/_\nd Spirit\nd* ˱of˲_/the/_\nd Lord\nd* \add is\add* on me, ˱of˲_which on_account ˱he˲_anointed me /to/_gospel_preach ˱to˲_/the/_poor, ˱he˲_/has/_sent_ me _out /to/_proclaim forgiveness ˱to˲_captives, and regained_sight ˱to˲_/the/_blind, /having_been/_oppressed /to/_send_out in forgiveness,
\v 19 /to/_proclaim /the/_=> acceptable <=_year ˱of˲_/the/_\nd Lord\nd*.”
\v 20 And /having/_rolled_up the scroll /having/_given_back \add it\add* ˱to˲_the attendant, ˱he˲_sat_down and the eyes ˱of˲_all in the synagogue were looking_intently ˱at˲_him.
\v 21 And ˱he˲_began /to_be/_saying to them, - “Today this - Scripture /has_been/_fulfilled in the ears ˱of˲_you_all.”
\v 22 And all /were/_testifying ˱to˲_him, and /were/_marveling at the words - ˱of˲_grace - going_out out_of the mouth ˱of˲_him, and ˱they˲_/were/_saying, is this “Not /the/_son ˱of˲_Joseph?”
\v 23 And ˱he˲_said to them, “Certainly ˱you_all˲_/will_be/_saying ˱to˲_me - this parable: ‘“physician, heal yourself”; as_much_as ˱we˲_heard /having/_become in - Capernaum, also do here in the hometown ˱of˲_you.’”
\v 24 And ˱he˲_said, “Truly, ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all that not_one prophet is acceptable in the hometown ˱of˲_him.
\v 25 But in truth ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all, were many widows in the days ˱of˲_Elijah in - Israel, when the sky /was/_shut for three years and six months when /a/_=> great <=_famine became on all the land,
\v 26 and Elijah /was/_sent to no_one ˱of˲_them, except - to Sarepta - ˱of˲_Sidon, to /the/_=> widow <=_woman.
\v 27 And many lepers were in - Israel, during Elisha the prophet, and no_one ˱of˲_them /was/_cleansed, except - Naaman the Syrian.”
\v 28 And all in the synagogue /were/_filled ˱with˲_rage hearing these \add things\add*,
\v 29 and /having/_risen_up, ˱they˲_cast_out him out ˱of˲_the city, and ˱they˲_led him to /the/_brow ˱of˲_the mountain on which the city ˱of˲_them /had_been/_built, so_as /to/_throw_ him _down.
\v 30 But he, /having/_passed_through through /the/_midst ˱of˲_them, /was/_going.
\v 31 ¶ And ˱he˲_came_down to Capernaum, /a/_city - ˱of˲_Galilee. And ˱he˲_was teaching them on the Sabbaths.
\v 32 And ˱they˲_/were_being/_astonished at the teaching ˱of˲_him, because the word ˱of˲_him was with authority.
\v 33 And in the synagogue was /a/_man having /a/_spirit ˱of˲_/a/_=> unclean <=_demon, and ˱he˲_cried_out ˱with˲_/a/_=> loud <=_voice,
\v 34 “Ha! What ˱to˲_us and ˱to˲_you, \nd Jesus\nd* Nazarean? Came_˱you˲ /to/_destroy us? ˱I˲_/have/_known who you are, the Holy \add One\add* - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*.”
\v 35 And - \nd Jesus\nd* gave_rebuke ˱to˲_it saying, “/Be/_silenced, and come_out from him!” And the demon /having/_thrown_ him _down into the midst, came_out from him, nothing /having/_harmed him.
\v 36 And amazement became on all, and ˱they˲_/were/_conversing_with to one_another saying, “What \add is\add* - this word, that with authority and power ˱he˲_/is/_commanding ˱to˲_the unclean spirits, and ˱they˲_/are/_coming_out?”
\v 37 And /the/_report concerning him /was/_going_out into every place ˱of˲_the surrounding_region.
\v 38 ¶ And from the synagogue /having/_risen_up, ˱he˲_came_in into the house ˱of˲_Simon. And /the/_mother_in_law - ˱of˲_Simon was /being/_gripped_with ˱with˲_/a/_=> great <=_fever, and ˱they˲_asked ˱to˲_him about her.
\v 39 And /having/_stood_by over her, ˱he˲_gave_rebuke ˱to˲_the fever, and ˱it˲_left her; and immediately /having/_stood_up, ˱she˲_/was/_serving ˱unto˲_them.
\v 40 ¶ And ˱at˲_/the/_setting ˱of˲_the sun, all as_many_as /were/_having ailing \add ones\add* ˱with˲_> various <_diseases, ˱they˲_brought them to him, and he laying_on his hands ˱to˲_one each ˱of˲_them, /was/_healing them.
\v 41 And also demons /was/_coming_out from many, crying_out and saying, - “You are the Son - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*.” But giving_rebuke, ˱he˲_/was/_=> not <=_allowing them /to_be/_speaking, because ˱they˲_/had/_known him to_be the \nd Messiah\nd*.
\v 42 ¶ And /having/_become day, /having/_come_out ˱he˲_/was/_gone into /a/_desolate place, and the crowds /were/_seeking_after him, and ˱they˲_came up_to him, and ˱they˲_/were/_restraining him - /to_ not _be/_going from them.
\v 43 But he said to them, - ˱it˲_/is/_fitting me also /to/_gospel_preach the Kingdom - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd* ˱to˲_the other “cities, because ˱I˲_/was/_sent_out for this.”
\v 44 And ˱he˲_was proclaiming in the synagogues - ˱of˲_Judea.

\v 1 ¶ And ˱it˲_became at the \add time\add*, the crowd /to_be/_imposing ˱on˲_him and /to_be/_hearing the word ˱of˲_the \nd God\nd*, and he was /having/_stood by the lake ˱of˲_Gennesaret,
\v 2 and ˱he˲_saw two boats /having/_stopped by the lake, but the fishermen from them /having/_gone_out, /were/_washing the nets.
\v 3 And /having/_boarded into one ˱of˲_the boats, which was ˱of˲_Simon, ˱he˲_asked him /to/_set_out little from the land. And /having/_sat_down, ˱he˲_/was/_teaching the crowds from the boat.
\v 4 And when ˱he˲_ceased speaking, ˱he˲_said to - Simon, “Set_out into the depth and lower the nets ˱of˲_you_all for /a/_catch.”
\v 5 And Simon answering, said, “Master, through all night /having/_labored, nothing ˱we˲_took, but at the word ˱of˲_you, ˱I˲_/will_be/_lowering the nets.”
\v 6 And this /having/_done, ˱they˲_caught /a/_=> great <=_multitude ˱of˲_fishes, and the nets ˱of˲_them /was_being/_torn.
\v 7 And ˱they˲_signaled ˱to˲_the companions in the other boat, - /having/_come /to/_give_help ˱to˲_them; and ˱they˲_came, and ˱they˲_filled both - boats, so_that them /to_be_being/_sunk.
\v 8 But Simon Peter /having/_seen fell_before ˱to˲_the knees ˱of˲_\nd Jesus\nd* saying, “Come_out from me, because ˱I˲_am /a/_man sinful, \nd Lord\nd*.”
\v 9 For amazement seized him and all the \add ones\add* with him, at the catch ˱of˲_the fishes which ˱they˲_captured,
\v 10 and also Jacobus and John, sons ˱of˲_Zebedee, who likewise were partners - ˱with˲_Simon. And - \nd Jesus\nd* said to - Simon, “/Be/_=> not <=_fearing; from the \add time\add* now ˱you˲_will_be catching people.”
\v 11 And /having/_brought_down the boats to the land, /having/_left all, ˱they˲_followed ˱after˲_him.
\v 12 ¶ And ˱it˲_became in that him to_be in one ˱of˲_the cities, and behold, /a/_man full ˱of˲_leprosy, and /having/_seen - \nd Jesus\nd*, /having/_fallen on /his/_face, ˱he˲_/was/_besought ˱of˲_him saying, “\nd Lord\nd*, if ˱you˲_/may_be/_willing, ˱you˲_/are/_being_able /to/_cleanse me.”
\v 13 And /having/_stretched_out his hand, ˱he˲_touched ˱against˲_him saying, “˱I˲_/am/_willing, /be/_cleansed!” And immediately the leprosy went_away from him.
\v 14 And he commanded ˱to˲_him, “/To/_tell no_one, but /having/_gone_away show yourself ˱to˲_the priest, and offer for the cleansing ˱of˲_you as Moses commanded, for /a/_testimony ˱to˲_them.”
\v 15 But the word concerning him /was/_passing_through more, and great crowds /were/_coming_together /to_be/_hearing, and /to_be_being/_healed from the sicknesses ˱of˲_them.
\v 16 But he was withdrawing in the deserts and praying.
\v 17 ¶ And ˱it˲_became on one ˱of˲_the days, and he was teaching, and Pharisees and law_teachers were sitting, who ˱they˲_were /having/_come out_of every village - ˱of˲_Galilee, and ˱of˲_Judea, and ˱of˲_Jerusalem. And /the/_power ˱of˲_/the/_\nd Lord\nd* was \add there\add* in_order that him /to_be/_healing.
\v 18 And behold, men carrying /a/_man on /a/_bed who was /having_been/_paralyzed, and ˱they˲_/were/_seeking /to/_carry_ him _in and /to/_put before him.
\v 19 And not /having/_found ˱by˲_what \add way\add* ˱they˲_/may/_carry_ him _in because_of the crowd, /having/_gone_up on the housetop, ˱they˲_let_ him _down through the tiles with the stretcher into the midst before - \nd Jesus\nd*.
\v 20 And /having/_seen the faith ˱of˲_them ˱he˲_said, “Man, the sins ˱of˲_you /have_been/_forgiven ˱to˲_you.”
\v 21 And the scribes and the Pharisees began /to_be/_reasoning saying, “Who is this who /is/_speaking slander? Who /is/_able /to/_forgive sins except - only - \nd God\nd*?”
\v 22 But - \nd Jesus\nd* /having/_known the speculations ˱of˲_them, answering said to them, “Why ˱you_all˲_/are/_reasoning in the hearts ˱of˲_you_all?
\v 23 Which is easier, /to/_say, the sins ˱of˲_you ‘/Have_been/_forgiven ˱to˲_you’, or /to/_say, ‘/Be/_raising and /be/_walking’?
\v 24 But in_order_that ˱you_all˲_/may_have/_known that the Son - ˱of˲_Man /is/_having authority on the earth /to_be/_forgiving sins”, ˱he˲_said ˱to˲_the paralytic, “˱to˲_you ˱I˲_/am/_saying, /be/_raising, and /having/_taken_up the stretcher ˱of˲_you, /be/_going to the house ˱of˲_you.”
\v 25 And immediately /having/_stood_up before them, /having/_taken_up on which ˱he˲_/was/_lying, ˱he˲_went_away to the home ˱of˲_him glorifying - \nd God\nd*.
\v 26 And amazement took all, and ˱they˲_/were/_glorifying - \nd God\nd*, and ˱they˲_/were/_filled ˱with˲_fear saying, - “˱We˲_saw remarkable \add things\add* today.”
\v 27 ¶ And after these \add things\add* ˱he˲_came_out, and saw /a/_tax_collector ˱with˲_/the/_name Levi, sitting at the tax_office, and ˱he˲_said ˱to˲_him, “/Be/_following ˱after˲_me.”

\v 2 and some women who were /having_been/_healed from evil spirits and sicknesses: Mary who /being/_called Magdalene, from whom seven demons /had/_come_out,
\v 3 and Joanna wife ˱of˲_Chusa /a/_manager ˱of˲_Herod, and Susanna, and many others, who /were/_serving ˱unto˲_them from the \add things\add* possessing ˱to˲_them.
\v 4 ¶ And /a/_=> great <=_crowd ¶ Coming_together and ˱of˲_the \add ones\add* in /the/_city journeying to him, ˱he˲_spoke by parable:
\v 5 “The \add one\add* sowing came_out - /to/_sow the seed ˱of˲_him. And at the \add time\add* him /to_be/_sowing, some indeed fell along the road, and ˱it˲_/was/_trampled and the birds ˱of˲_the sky devoured them.
\v 6 And other fell_down on rock, and /having_been/_sprouted /was/_withered because_of the \add thing\add* /to_ not _be/_having moisture.
\v 7 And other fell in /the/_midst ˱of˲_the thorns, and /having_been/_grown_up the thorns choked_ it _out.
\v 8 And other fell on the - good soil, also /having_been/_sprouted produced fruit /a/_hundred_fold.” These \add things\add* saying, ˱he˲_/was/_calling, “The \add one\add* having ears /to_be/_hearing, ˱him˲_/let_be/_hearing.”
\v 9 ¶ And the disciples ˱of˲_him /were/_asking him, “What this?” might_be - parable?”
\v 10 And he said, “˱It˲_/has_been/_given ˱to˲_you_all /to/_know the mysteries ˱of˲_the Kingdom - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*, but ˱to˲_the rest in parables, in_order_that ‘seeing ˱they˲_/may_ not _be/_seeing, and hearing ˱they˲_/may_ not _be/_understanding’.
\v 11 ¶ And this is the parable: the seed is the word - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*.
\v 12 And the \add ones\add* along the road are the \add ones\add* /having/_heard, thereafter the devil /is/_coming and /is/_taking_away the word from the heart ˱of˲_them, in_order_that not /having/_believed ˱they˲_/may_be/_saved.
\v 13 And the \add ones\add* on the rock, who whenever ˱they˲_/may/_hear with joy /are/_receiving the word, and these /are/_=> not <=_having /a/_root, who for /a/_time /are/_believing, and in /the/_time ˱of˲_temptation ˱they˲_/are/_withdrawing_from.
\v 14 And the \add seed\add* /having/_fallen into the thorns, these are the \add ones\add* /having/_heard, and going /are_being/_choked under worries, and riches, and gratifications - ˱of˲_living, and /are/_=> not <=_brought_to_maturity.
\v 15 But the \add seed\add* in the good soil, these are \add the_ones\add* who in /a/_heart good and good, /having/_heard the word /are/_keeping \add it\add*, and /are/_bearing_fruit by endurance.
\v 16 ¶ And no_one /having/_lit /a/_lamp, /is/_covering it ˱with˲_/a/_object or /is/_putting \add it\add* beneath /a/_bed, but /is/_putting \add it\add* on /a/_lampstand,
\v 17 For not is hidden which /will_ not _be/_becoming manifest, nor secret which not /may_ not _be/_known and /may/_come to manifest.
\v 18 Therefore /be/_watching_out how ˱you_all˲_/are/_hearing; for whoever - /may_be/_having, /will_be_being/_given ˱to˲_him, and whoever - /may_ not _be/_having, even what ˱he˲_/is/_supposing /to_be/_having /will_be_being/_taken_away from him.”
\v 19 ¶ And ¶ the mother and the brothers ˱of˲_him arrived to him, and ˱they˲_/were/_=> not <=_able /to/_reach ˱to˲_him because_of the crowd.
\v 20 And ˱it˲_/was/_reported ˱to˲_him, “The mother ˱of˲_you and the brothers ˱of˲_you, /have/_stood outside wanting /to/_see you.”
\v 21 But he answering said to them, “/The/_mother ˱of˲_me and /the/_brothers ˱of˲_me, these are the \add ones\add* hearing and doing the word - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*.”
\v 22 ¶ And ˱it˲_became on one ˱of˲_the days, and he and the disciples ˱of˲_him boarded into /a/_boat, and ˱he˲_said to them, “˱We˲_/may/_pass_through to the \add side\add* across ˱of˲_the lake”. And ˱they˲_/were/_launched.
\v 23 But sailing ˱of˲_them, ˱he˲_fell_asleep. And /a/_=> wind <=_storm came_down on the lake, and ˱they˲_/were_being/_swamped and ˱they˲_/were/_risking_danger.
\v 24 And /having/_approached, ˱they˲_awoke him saying, “Master, Master, ˱we˲_/are/_perishing!” And he /having_been/_awoke, gave_rebuke ˱to˲_the wind, and ˱to˲_the wave, ˱of˲_the water, and ˱they˲_ceased and ˱it˲_became /a/_calm.
\v 25 And ˱he˲_said ˱to˲_them, “Where \add is\add* the faith ˱of˲_you_all?” And /having_been/_afraid, ˱they˲_marveled saying to one_another, “Who consequently is this, that ˱he˲_/is/_commanding both ˱to˲_the winds and ˱to˲_the water,
\v 26 ¶ And ˱they˲_sailed_down to the region ˱of˲_the Gerasenes, which is opposite - Galilee.
\v 27 And /having/_come_out ˱to˲_him on the land, /a/_=> certain <=_man met \add him\add* out_of the city having demons, and ˱for˲_> much <_time not dressed_in garment, and /was/_=> not <=_remaining in /a/_house, but in the tombs.
\v 28 And /having/_seen - \nd Jesus\nd*, /having/_cried_out ˱he˲_fell_before ˱to˲_him, and ˱with˲_/a/_=> loud <=_voice said, “What ˱to˲_me and ˱to˲_you, \nd Jesus\nd*, /the/_Son - ˱of˲_> The Highest <_\nd God\nd*? ˱I˲_/am/_beseeching ˱of˲_you, ˱you˲_/may/_=> not <=_torment me!”
\v 29 for ˱He˲_commanded ˱to˲_the the spirit unclean /to/_come_out from the man. For ˱for˲_many times ˱it˲_/had/_seized him, and ˱he˲_/was_being/_bound ˱with˲_chains and /being/_guarded ˱in˲_shackles, and tearing the bonds, ˱he˲_/was_being/_driven by the demon into the deserts.
\v 30 And - \nd Jesus\nd* asked him, “What ˱to˲_you is /the/_name?” And he said, “Legion”, because many demons came_in into him.
\v 31 And ˱they˲_/were/_imploring him that ˱he˲_/may/_=> not <=_command ˱to˲_them /to/_go_away into the Abyss.
\v 32 ¶ And there was /a/_herd ˱of˲_> many <_pigs /being/_fed on the mountain, and ˱they˲_implored him that ˱he˲_/may/_permit ˱to˲_them /to/_come_in into those. And ˱he˲_permitted ˱to˲_them.
\v 33 And the demons /having/_come_out from the man, ˱they˲_came_in into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep_bank into the lake, and /was/_drowned.
\v 34 ¶ And the \add ones\add* feeding \add them\add* /having/_seen, the \add thing\add* /having/_become, ˱they˲_fled and ˱they˲_reported to the city and to the country.
\v 35 And ˱they˲_came_out /to/_see the \add thing\add* /having/_become, and came to - \nd Jesus\nd*, and found the man sitting, from whom the demons came_out, /having_been/_clothed and being_sensible before the feet ˱of˲_\nd Jesus\nd*, and ˱they˲_/were/_afraid.
\v 36 And the \add ones\add* /having/_seen \add it\add* reported ˱to˲_them, how the \add one\add* /having_been/_demon_possessed /was/_healed.
\v 37 And all the multitude ˱of˲_the surrounding_region ˱of˲_the Gerasenes asked, him, /to/_go_away from them, because ˱they˲_/were_being/_gripped_with ˱with˲_> great <_fear. And he /having/_boarded, into /the/_boat, returned.
\v 38 But the man from whom /had/_come_out the demons, /was/_beseeching ˱of˲_him, to_be with him. But ˱he˲_sent_ him _away saying,
\v 39 “/Be/_returning to the house ˱of˲_you, and /be/_describing as_much_as - \nd God\nd* did ˱for˲_you.” And ˱he˲_went_away throughout all the city, proclaiming as_much_as - \nd Jesus\nd* did ˱for˲_him.
\v 40 ¶ And at the \add time\add* - \nd Jesus\nd* /to_be/_returning, the crowd welcomed him, for were all waiting ˱for˲_him.
\v 41 And behold, /a/_man came ˱to˲_whose name \add was\add* Jairus, and this \add one\add* /was/_being /a/_ruler ˱of˲_the synagogue, and /having/_fallen before the feet ˱of˲_\nd Jesus\nd*, ˱he˲_/was/_imploring him /to/_come_in to the house ˱of˲_him,
\v 42 because /a/_=> only_begotten <=_daughter was ˱to˲_him, about twelve ˱of˲_years, and she /was/_dying_off. ¶ But at the \add time\add* /to_be/_going him, the crowds /were/_pressing_against him.
\v 43 And /a/_woman being with /a/_hemorrhage ˱of˲_blood for twelve years, who was_ not _able /to_be/_healed by no_one,
\v 44 /having/_approached behind, ˱she˲_touched ˱against˲_the fringe ˱of˲_the garment ˱of˲_him, and immediately the hemorrhage ˱of˲_the blood ˱of˲_her stopped.
\v 45 And - \nd Jesus\nd* said, “Who \add is\add* the \add one\add* /having/_touched ˱against˲_me?” And disowning \add it\add* all, - Peter said, “Master, the crowds /are/_pressing you and ˱they˲_/are/_pressing_in.”
\v 46 But - \nd Jesus\nd* said, “Someone touched ˱against˲_me, for I knew power /having/_come_out from me.”
\v 47 And the woman /having/_seen that ˱she˲_> not <_escaped_notice, came trembling and /having/_fallen_before ˱to˲_him, ˱she˲_reported before all for what cause ˱she˲_touched ˱against˲_him, the people, and how ˱she˲_/was/_healed immediately.
\v 48 And he said ˱to˲_her, “Daughter, the faith ˱of˲_you /has/_healed you; /be/_going in peace.”
\v 49 ¶ Still ˱of˲_him speaking, someone /is/_coming from the synagogue_leader saying, - the daughter ˱of˲_you “/Has/_died, /be/_troubling the teacher no_longer.”
\v 50 But - \nd Jesus\nd* /having/_heard, answered ˱to˲_him, “/Be/_=> not <=_fearing, only /be/_believing, and ˱she˲_/will_be_being/_healed.”
\v 51 And /having/_come into the house, ˱he˲_> not <_allowed anyone /to/_come_in, with him, except - Peter, and John, and Jacobus, and the father ˱of˲_the girl, and the mother.
\v 52 And all /were/_weeping and ˱they˲_/were/_mourning ˱for˲_her. But he said, “/Be/_=> not <=_weeping, for ˱she˲_> not <_died_off, but ˱she˲_/is/_sleeping.”
\v 53 And ˱they˲_/were/_ridiculing ˱of˲_him, /having/_known that ˱she˲_died_off.
\v 54 And he /having/_taken_hold ˱of˲_the hand ˱of˲_her, called saying, “- girl, /be/_raising!”
\v 55 And the spirit ˱of˲_her returned, and ˱she˲_rose_up immediately, and ˱he˲_directed ˱to˲_her /to_be/_given \add something\add* /to/_eat.
\v 56 And the parents ˱of˲_her marvelled; but he ˱he˲_commanded ˱to˲_them /to/_tell no_one what /having/_become.
\c 9
\v 1 ¶ And /having/_called_together the twelve, ˱he˲_gave ˱to˲_them power and authority over all the demons, and /to_be/_healing diseases,
\v 2 and ˱he˲_sent_ them _out /to_be/_proclaiming the Kingdom - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*, and /to_be/_healing the sick.
\v 3 And ˱he˲_said to them, “/Be/_taking_ nothing _away for the journey, neither staff, nor knapsack, nor bread, nor silver, nor /to_be/_having two tunics.
\v 4 And into whatever - house ˱you_all˲_/may/_come_in, /be/_remaining there and from_there /be/_coming_out.
\v 5 And as_many_as - /may_ not _be/_receiving you_all, coming_out from - that city, /be/_shaking_off the dust from the feet ˱of˲_you_all, for /a/_testimony against them.”
\v 6 And coming_out, ˱they˲_/were/_passing_through throughout the villages, gospel_preaching and healing everywhere.
\v 7 ¶ And ¶ Herod the tetrarch heard the \add things\add* becoming all, and /was/_thoroughly_perplexing, because_of the \add thing\add* /to_be_being/_said by some that John /was/_raised from /the/_dead,
\v 8 and by some that Elijah /was/_seen, and ˱by˲_others that /a/_certain prophet ˱of˲_the ancients rose_up.
\v 9 And Herod said, “I beheaded John, but who is this concerning whom ˱I˲_/am/_hearing such \add things\add*?” And ˱he˲_/was/_seeking /to/_see him.
\v 10 ¶ And /having/_returned, the ambassadors described ˱to˲_him as_much_as ˱they˲_did. And /having/_taken them, ˱he˲_withdrew by himself into /a/_city /being/_called Bethsaida.
\v 11 But the crowds /having/_known, followed ˱after˲_him. And /having/_welcomed them, ˱he˲_/was/_speaking ˱to˲_them concerning the Kingdom - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*, and ˱he˲_/was/_healing the \add ones\add* having need ˱of˲_healing.
\v 12 ¶ And the day began /to_be/_declining, and the twelve /having/_approached said ˱to˲_him, “Send_away the crowd, in_order_that /having_been/_gone into the surrounding villages and country, ˱they˲_/may/_lodge and ˱they˲_/may/_find provisions, because ˱we˲_are here in /a/_desolate place.”
\v 13 But ˱he˲_said to them, “You_all give \add something\add* ˱to˲_them.” /to/_eat.” But they said, “Not ˱to˲_us are more than five loaves and two fishes, if surely_not /having_been/_gone, we /may/_buy foods for all the this people.”
\v 14 For ˱they˲_were about five_thousand men.) And ˱he˲_said to the disciples ˱of˲_him, “Recline them ˱in˲_groups about fifty each.”
\v 15 And thus ˱they˲_did, and ˱they˲_> all <_reclined.
\v 16 And /having/_taken the five loaves and the two fishes, /having/_looked_up to the sky, ˱he˲_blessed them and broke_up \add them\add*, and /was/_giving \add them\add* ˱to˲_the disciples /to/_set_before ˱before˲_the crowd.
\v 17 And all ate and /were/_satisfied, and twelve baskets /was/_=> the \add amount\add* <=_taken_up /having/_been_leftover ˱to˲_them ˱of˲_/the/_fragments.
\v 18 ¶ And ˱it˲_became at the \add time\add* him to_be praying by only \add them\add*, the disciples /were/_being_with ˱with˲_him, and ˱he˲_asked them saying, “Whom /are/_=> crowds <=_saying the me to_be?”
\v 19 And they answering said, “John the Baptist, and others, Elijah, but others that /a/_certain prophet ˱of˲_the ancients rose_up.”
\v 20 And ˱he˲_said ˱to˲_them, “But whom you_all /are/_saying me to_be?” And Peter answering said, “The \nd Messiah\nd* - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*.”
\v 21 ¶ And he, /having/_warned ˱to˲_them, commanded \add them\add* /to_be/_telling this ˱to˲_no_one,
\v 22 /having/_said, - “˱It˲_/is/_fitting the Son - ˱of˲_Man /to/_suffer many \add things\add*, and /to_be/_rejected by the elders, and chief_priests, and scribes, and /to_be/_killed_off and ˱on˲_the third day /to_be/_raised.”
\v 23 ¶ And ˱he˲_/was/_saying to all, “If anyone /is/_wanting /to_be/_coming after me, ˱him˲_/let/_renounce himself, and ˱him˲_/let/_take_up the cross ˱of˲_him in_every day, and ˱him˲_/let_be/_following ˱after˲_me.
\v 24 For whoever - /may_be/_wanting /to/_save the life ˱of˲_him, /will_be/_losing it; but whoever - /may/_lose the life ˱of˲_him on_account me, this \add one\add* /will_be/_saving it.
\v 25 For what /is_being/_benefited /a/_person, /having/_gained the whole world, and /having/_destroyed himself or /having_been/_lost?
\v 26 For whoever - /may_be/_ashamed_of me and - my words, this \add one\add* the Son - ˱of˲_Man /will_be_being/_ashamed \add of\add*, whenever ˱he˲_/may/_come in the glory ˱of˲_him, and ˱of˲_the Father, and ˱of˲_the holy angels.
\v 27 But ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all truly, are some ˱of˲_the \add ones\add* /having/_stood here, who by_no_means /may/_=> not <=_taste ˱of˲_death, until - ˱they˲_/may/_see the Kingdom - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*.”
\v 28 ¶ And ˱it˲_became about eight days after - these sayings, /having/_taken Peter, and John, and Jacobus, ˱he˲_went_up on the mountain /to/_pray.
\v 29 And ˱it˲_became at the \add time\add* him /to_be/_praying, the appearance ˱of˲_the face ˱of˲_him different, and the clothing ˱of˲_him gleaming white.
\v 30 And behold, two men /were/_conversing_with ˱with˲_him, who were Moses and Elijah,
\v 31 who /having_been/_seen in glory, /were/_spoken the departure ˱of˲_him, which ˱he˲_/was/_going /to_be/_fulfilling in Jerusalem.
\v 32 And - Peter and the \add ones\add* with him were /having_been/_weighed_down ˱with˲_sleep; but /having/_fully_awoken ˱they˲_saw the glory ˱of˲_him, and the two men - /having/_stood_with ˱with˲_him.
\v 33 And ˱it˲_became at the \add time\add* them /to_be_being/_departed from him, - Peter said to - \nd Jesus\nd*, “Master, ˱it˲_is good ˱for˲_us here to_be, and ˱we˲_/may/_make three tents: one ˱for˲_you, and one ˱for˲_Moses, and one ˱for˲_Elijah”, not /having/_known what ˱he˲_/is/_saying.
\v 34 And ˱of˲_him saying these \add things\add*, /a/_cloud became and overshadowed them; and ˱they˲_/were/_afraid at the \add time\add* /to/_come_in them into the cloud.
\v 35 And /a/_voice became out_of the cloud saying, “This is the Son ˱of˲_me, the \add one\add* /having_been/_chosen, /be/_hearing ˱from˲_him.”
\v 36 And at the \add time\add* the voice /to/_become, only \nd Jesus\nd* /was/_found. And they kept_silent, and ˱they˲_reported ˱to˲_no_one in those - days nothing ˱of˲_what \add things\add* ˱they˲_/have/_seen.
\v 37 ¶ And ˱it˲_became ˱on˲_the next day, ˱of˲_them /having/_come_down from the mountain, /a/_=> great <=_crowd met ˱with˲_him.
\v 38 And behold, /a/_man from the crowd shouted saying, “Teacher, ˱I˲_/am/_beseeching ˱of˲_you /to/_look_at at the son ˱of˲_me, because ˱he˲_is /an/_only_begotten ˱to˲_me.”
\v 39 And behold, /a/_spirit /is/_taking him, and suddenly ˱he˲_/is/_crying_out and ˱it˲_/is/_convulsing him with foam, and /is/_going_away from him, ˱with˲_difficultly, bruising him.
\v 40 And ˱I˲_/was/_besought ˱of˲_the disciples ˱of˲_you that ˱they˲_/may/_cast_out it, and ˱they˲_/were/_=> not <=_able.
\v 41 And - \nd Jesus\nd* answering said, “O unbelieving generation and /having_been/_perverted, until when ˱I˲_will_be with you_all and ˱I˲_/will_be/_tolerating ˱of˲_you_all? Bring_forward here the son ˱of˲_you.”
\v 42 And still approaching ˱of˲_him, the demon attacked him and threw_into_convulsions \add him\add*. But - \nd Jesus\nd* gave_rebuke ˱to˲_the - unclean spirit, and ˱he˲_healed the boy and gave_ him _back ˱to˲_the father ˱of˲_him.
\v 43 And all /were_being/_astonished at the greatness - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*. ¶ But all wondering at all which ˱he˲_/was/_doing, ˱he˲_said to the disciples ˱of˲_him,
\v 44 “You_all set into the ears ˱of˲_you_all - these words, for the Son - ˱of˲_Man /is/_going /to_be_being/_given_over into /the/_hands ˱of˲_people.”
\v 45 But they /were/_not_knowing - this saying, and ˱it˲_was /having_been/_concealed from them, in_order_that ˱they˲_/may/_=> not <=_sense it, and ˱they˲_/were/_fearing /to/_ask him concerning - this saying.
\v 46 ¶ And /a/_speculation came_in among them, who - might_be the_> greater <_\add one\add* ˱of˲_them.
\v 47 But - \nd Jesus\nd* /having/_known the speculation ˱of˲_the heart ˱of˲_them, /having/_taken_hold_of /a/_little_child, stood it by himself,
\v 48 and said ˱to˲_them, “Whoever - /may/_receive this - little_child in the name ˱of˲_me, /is/_receiving me, and whoever - /may/_receive me, /is/_receiving the \add one\add* /having/_sent_out me. For the \add one\add* being least among all you_all, this \add one\add* is great.”
\v 49 ¶ And John answering said, “Master, ˱we˲_saw someone casting_out demons in the name ˱of˲_you, and ˱we˲_/were/_forbidding him, because ˱he˲_/is/_=> not <=_following with us.”
\v 50 But - \nd Jesus\nd* said to him, “/Be/_=> not <=_forbidding \add him\add*, for who is not against you_all, is for you_all.”
\v 51 ¶ And ˱it˲_became at the \add time\add* /to_be_being/_fulfilled the days ˱of˲_the ascension ˱of˲_him, and he established his face, - /to_be/_going to Jerusalem,
\v 52 and ˱he˲_sent_out messengers before /the/_face ˱of˲_him. And /having_been/_gone, ˱they˲_came_in into /a/_village ˱of˲_/the/_Samaritans, so_as /to/_prepare ˱for˲_him.
\v 53 And ˱they˲_> not <_received him, because the face ˱of˲_him was going toward Jerusalem.
\v 54 And /having/_seen \add it\add*, the disciples Jacobus and John said, “\nd Lord\nd*, /are/_˱you˲_willing \add that\add* ˱we˲_/may/_call fire /to/_come_down from the sky and /to/_consume_ them _up?”
\v 55 But /having_been/_turned, ˱he˲_gave_rebuke ˱to˲_them.
\v 56 And ˱they˲_/were/_gone to another village.
\v 57 ¶ And going ˱of˲_them on the road, someone said to him, “˱I˲_/will_be/_following ˱after˲_you wherever - ˱you˲_/may_be/_going_away.”
\v 58 And - \nd Jesus\nd* said ˱to˲_him, “- foxes /are/_having burrows, and - birds ˱of˲_the sky nests, but the Son - ˱of˲_Man /is/_=> not <=_having where his head /may_be/_laying.”
\v 59 And ˱he˲_said to another, “/Be/_following ˱after˲_me.” But he said, “\nd Lord\nd*, permit ˱to˲_me /having/_gone_away, first /to/_bury the father ˱of˲_me.”
\v 60 But ˱he˲_said ˱to˲_him, “Leave the dead /to/_bury the dead ˱by˲_themselves, but you /having/_gone_away, /be/_proclaiming the Kingdom - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*.”
\v 61 And also another ˱he˲_said, “˱I˲_/will_be/_following ˱after˲_you, \nd Lord\nd*, but first permit ˱to˲_me /to/_bid_goodbye ˱to˲_the \add ones\add* at the home ˱of˲_me.”
\v 62 But - \nd Jesus\nd* said, “No_one “/Having/_laid_on the hand ˱of˲_him on /the/_plow, and looking on the \add things\add* behind, is suitable ˱in˲_the Kingdom - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*.”
\c 10
\v 1 ¶ And ¶ after, ¶ these \add things\add* the \nd Lord\nd* appointed seventy two others, and ˱he˲_sent_out each ˱by˲_two before /the/_face ˱of˲_him, into every city and place where he /was/_going /to_be/_coming.
\v 2 ˱He˲_/was/_saying but to them, “On_one_hand the harvest great, on_the_other_hand the workers few. Therefore /be/_besought ˱of˲_the \nd Lord\nd* ˱of˲_the harvest, so_that workers ˱he˲_/may/_cast_out into the harvest ˱of˲_him.
\v 3 /Be/_going behold, ˱I˲_/am/_sending_ you_all _out as lambs in /the/_midst ˱of˲_wolves.
\v 4 /Be/_bearing neither purse, nor knapsack, nor sandals, and ˱you_all˲_/may/_greet no_one on the road.
\v 5 And whatever house - ˱you_all˲_/may/_come_in into, first /be/_saying, ‘Peace - ˱to˲_> this <_house.’
\v 6 And if there may_be /a/_son ˱of˲_peace, the peace ˱of˲_you_all /will_be/_resting_on on it; but if not surely ˱it˲_/will_be/_returning to you_all.
\v 7 And /be/_remaining in /the/_same - house, eating and drinking the \add things\add* from them, for the worker \add is\add* worthy ˱of˲_the wage ˱of˲_him. /Be/_=> not <=_moving from house to house.
\v 8 And into whatever - city ˱you_all˲_/may_be/_coming_in, and ˱they˲_/may_be/_receiving you_all, /be/_eating the \add things\add* /being/_set_before ˱before˲_you_all.
\v 9 And /be/_healing the sick in it, and /be/_saying ˱to˲_them, the Kingdom - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd* ‘/Has/_neared to you_all.’
\v 10 But into whatever - city ˱you_all˲_/may/_come_in, and ˱they˲_/may_ not _be/_receiving you_all, /having/_come_out into the roads ˱of˲_it say,
\v 11 ‘˱We˲_/are/_wiping_off ˱to˲_you_all even the dust - /having_been/_joined_together to the feet ˱to˲_us out_of the city ˱of˲_you_all; however /be/_knowing this that the Kingdom - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd* /has/_neared.’
\v 12 ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all that will_be more_tolerable ˱for˲_Sodom in - that, day, than - ˱for˲_> that <_city.
\v 13 ¶ Woe ˱to˲_you, Chorazin! Woe ˱to˲_you, Bethsaida! Because if the miracles and Sidon /were/_become, - /having/_become in you_all in Tyre, ˱they˲_> would <_repented sitting in sackcloth and ashes long_ago.
\v 14 However ˱it˲_will_be more_tolerable ˱for˲_Tyre and Sidon, in the judgment than ˱for˲_you_all.
\v 15 And you, Capernaum, ˱you˲_/will_ not _be_being/_exalted to heaven? ˱You˲_/will_be_being/_coming_down to Hades.
\v 16 ¶ The \add one\add* hearing ˱from˲_you_all, /is/_hearing ˱from˲_me, and the \add one\add* rejecting you_all, /is/_rejecting me; and the \add one\add* rejecting me, /is/_rejecting the \add one\add* /having/_sent_ me _out.”
\v 17 ¶ And the seventy two returned with joy saying, “\nd Lord\nd*, even the demons /is_being/_subjected ˱to˲_us in the name ˱of˲_you.”
\v 18 And ˱he˲_said ˱to˲_them, “˱I˲_/was/_observing - Satan /having/_fallen as lightning out_of the heaven.
\v 19 Behold, ˱I˲_/have/_given ˱to˲_you_all the authority - /to_be/_treading on serpents and scorpions, and on all the power ˱of˲_the enemy, and nothing /may/_=> not <=_injure you_all by_no_means.
\v 20 However in this /be/_=> not <=_rejoicing that the spirits /is_being/_subjected ˱to˲_you_all, but /be/_rejoicing that the names ˱of˲_you_all /has_been/_inscribed in the heavens.”
\v 21 ¶ In /the/_same - hour, ˱he˲_exulted ˱in˲_the - Holy \nd Spirit\nd* and said, “˱I˲_/am/_confessing ˱to˲_you, Father, \nd Lord\nd* - ˱of˲_heaven and - earth, that ˱you˲_hidden_away these \add things\add* from /the/_wise and intelligent, and ˱you˲_revealed them ˱to˲_infants. Yes. - Father, because thus ˱it˲_became good_pleasure before you.
\v 22 All \add things\add* /was/_given_over ˱to˲_me by the Father ˱of˲_me, and no_one /is/_knowing who is the Son, except - the Father, and who is the Father, except - the Son and ˱to˲_whom - the Son /may_be/_wishing /to/_reveal \add him\add*.”
\v 23 ¶ And /having_been/_turned to the disciples ˱he˲_said by himself, “Blessed \add are\add* the eyes the \add ones\add* seeing what ˱you_all˲_/are/_seeing!
\v 24 For ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all that many prophets and kings wanted /to/_see what you_all /are/_seeing, and ˱they˲_> not <_saw, and /to/_hear ˱from˲_me what ˱you_all˲_/are/_hearing, and ˱they˲_> not <_heard.”
\v 25 ¶ And behold, /a/_=> certain <=_lawyer stood_up, testing him saying, “Teacher, /having/_done what, /will_˱I˲_/be_inheriting life eternal?”
\v 26 And he said to him, “In the law what /has_˱it˲_/been_written? How ˱you˲_/are/_reading \add it\add*?”
\v 27 And he answering said, “‘˱You˲_/will_be/_loving /the/_\nd Lord\nd* the \nd God\nd* ˱of˲_you, with all /the/_heart ˱of˲_you, and with all the soul ˱of˲_you, and with all the strength ˱of˲_you, and with all the mind ˱of˲_you’, and, ‘the neighbor ˱of˲_you as yourself.’”
\v 28 And ˱he˲_said ˱to˲_him, “˱You˲_answered correctly. /Be/_doing this, and ˱you˲_/will_be/_living.”
\v 29 ¶ But he wanting /to/_justify himself, said to - \nd Jesus\nd*, “And who is /the/_neighbor ˱of˲_me?”
\v 30 - \nd Jesus\nd* /having/_replied said, “/A/_=> certain <=_man /was/_coming_down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and ˱he˲_fell_among ˱among˲_robbers, who both /having/_stripped_ him _off, and /having/_inflicted wounds, ˱they˲_went_away /having/_left \add him\add* half_dead.
\v 31 And by coincidence /a/_=> certain <=_priest /was/_coming_down on - that road, and /having/_seen him passed_by_opposite.
\v 32 And likewise also /a/_Levite /having/_become to the place, /having/_come and /having/_seen passed_by_opposite.
\v 33 But /a/_=> certain <=_Samaritan journeying came to him, and /having/_seen ˱he˲_/was/_feeling_compassion
\v 34 and /having/_approached, ˱he˲_bound_up the wounds ˱of˲_him, pouring_on olive_oil and wine, and /having/_mounted him on his own mount, ˱he˲_brought him to /an/_inn and /was/_taken_care ˱of˲_him.
\v 35 And on next the \add day\add* /having/_cast_out, ˱he˲_gave two denarii ˱to˲_the innkeeper, and said, ‘/Be/_taking_care ˱of˲_him, and whatever anything - ˱you˲_/may/_additionally_spend, I on the \add way\add* me /to_be/_returning ˱I˲_/will_be/_giving_back ˱to˲_you.’
\v 36 Which ˱of˲_these - three /is/_supposing ˱to˲_you /to_have/_become /a/_neighbor, ˱of˲_the \add one\add* /having/_fallen_in among the robbers?”
\v 37 And he said, “The \add one\add* /having/_done - mercy with him.” And - \nd Jesus\nd* said ˱to˲_him, “/Be/_going and you /be/_doing likewise.”
\v 38 ¶ And at the \add time\add* them /to_be/_going, he came_in into /a/_=> certain <=_village; and /a/_=> /a/_certain <=_woman ˱by˲_/the/_name Martha welcomed him,
\v 39 and ˱to˲_this \add woman\add* ˱she˲_was /a/_sister /being/_called Mary, who also /having_been/_seated_beside at the feet the ˱of˲_\nd Jesus\nd*, /was/_hearing the word ˱of˲_him.
\v 40 But - Martha /was_being/_pulled_away about much service; and /having/_approached said, “\nd Lord\nd*, not /is/_˱it˲_mattering ˱to˲_you that the sister ˱of˲_me left only me /to_be/_serving? Therefore tell ˱to˲_her that ˱she˲_/may/_help ˱with˲_me!”
\v 41 But the \nd Lord\nd* answering said ˱to˲_her, “Martha, Martha, ˱you˲_/are/_worrying and ˱you˲_/are_being/_troubled about many \add things\add*,
\v 42 but ˱there˲_is need ˱of˲_one; Mary chose for the good portion, which /will_ not _be_being/_taken_away from her.”
\c 11
\v 1 ¶ And ˱it˲_became at the \add time\add* him to_be in /a/_=> certain <=_place praying, when ˱he˲_ceased, someone ˱of˲_the disciples ˱of˲_him said to him, “\nd Lord\nd*, teach us /to_be/_praying, as also John taught the disciples ˱of˲_him.”
\v 2 And ˱he˲_said ˱to˲_them, “Whenever /be/_praying, /be/_saying, ‘Father, /let_ the name ˱of˲_you _be/_sanctified. /let/_=> the kingdom ˱of˲_you. <=_Come.
\v 3 /Be/_giving - the ˱to˲_us daily_needed bread ˱of˲_us, - in_every day.
\v 4 And forgive ˱to˲_us the sins ˱of˲_us, for also ˱we˲_> ourselves <_/are/_forgiving ˱to˲_everyone owing ˱to˲_us. And not /may/_˱you˲_carry_in us into temptation.’”
\v 5 ¶ And ˱he˲_said to them, “Who of you_all /will_be/_having /a/_friend, and /will_be/_going to him ˱at˲_midnight, and /may/_say ˱to˲_him, ‘Friend, lend three loaves ˱to˲_me,
\v 6 since /a/_friend ˱of˲_me arrived from /a/_journey to me, and ˱I˲_/am/_=> not <=_having what ˱I˲_/will_be/_setting_before ˱to˲_him.’
\v 7 And_that \add one\add* inside answering /may/_say, ‘/Be/_=> not <=_bringing_about ˱to˲_me troubles; the door /has_been/_shut already, and the little_children ˱of˲_me are with me in the bed; ˱I˲_/am/_=> not <=_being_able /having/_risen_up /to/_give \add anything\add* ˱to˲_you.’
\v 8 ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all, even if /will_ not _be/_giving ˱to˲_him /having/_risen_up, because_of that to_be friend ˱of˲_him, surely because_of the persistence ˱of˲_him /having_been/_raised, /will_be/_giving ˱to˲_him ˱of˲_as_much_as ˱he˲_/is/_needing.
\v 9 ¶ And_I /am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all, ‘/Be/_requesting, and ˱it˲_/will_be_being/_given ˱to˲_you_all; /be/_seeking, and ˱you_all˲_/will_be/_finding; /be/_knocking, and ˱it˲_/will_be_being/_opened_up ˱to˲_you_all.
\v 10 For everyone - requesting /is/_receiving, and the \add one\add* seeking /is/_finding, and ˱to˲_the \add one\add* knocking ˱it˲_/is/_opening_up.’
\v 11 and who of ˱of˲_you_all the son /will_be/_requesting the father, /a/_fish, and instead_of /a/_fish, /will_be/_handing_out /a/_serpent? ˱to˲_him
\v 12 or also /will_be/_requesting /an/_egg, /will_be/_handing_out /a/_scorpion ˱to˲_him?
\v 13 Therefore if you_all being evil, /have/_known good gifts /to_be/_giving ˱to˲_the children ˱of˲_you_all, ˱for˲_how_much more the Father who \add is\add* of heaven /will_be/_giving /the/_=> Holy <=_\nd Spirit\nd* ˱to˲_the \add ones\add* requesting him?”
\v 14 ¶ And ˱he˲_was casting_out /a/_=> mute <=_demon. And ˱it˲_became the demon /having/_come_out, the mute \add man\add* spoke. And the crowds marveled.
\v 15 But some of them said, “˱He˲_/is/_casting_out the demons by Beelzeboul the ruler ˱of˲_the demons.”
\v 16 And others testing, /were/_seeking /a/_sign from /the/_sky from him.
\v 17 But he /having/_known the thoughts ˱of˲_them said ˱to˲_them, “Every kingdom /having_been/_divided against itself /is_being/_desolated, and /a/_house against /a/_house /is/_falling.
\v 18 And if - Satan also /was/_divided against himself, how /will_ the kingdom ˱of˲_him _be_being/_stood? Because ˱you_all˲_/are/_saying, by Beelzeboul me /to_be/_casting_out the demons.
\v 19 And if I /am/_casting_out the demons by Beelzeboul, by whom /are/_=> the sons ˱of˲_you_all <=_casting_out? Because_of this, they will_be judges ˱of˲_you_all.
\v 20 But if I /am/_casting_out the demons by /the/_finger ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*, consequently the Kingdom - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd* came on you_all.
\v 21 Whenever the strong \add one\add* /having_been/_armed, /may_be/_guarding the palace ˱of˲_himself, the \add things\add* possessing ˱of˲_him is; in peace;
\v 22 but when stronger \add than\add* him /having/_come_over, /may/_overcome him, ˱he˲_/is/_taking_away the whole_armor ˱of˲_him in which ˱he˲_/had/_trusted, and /is/_distributing the plunder ˱of˲_him.
\v 23 The \add one\add* being not with me, is against me, and the \add one\add* not gathering_together with me, /is/_scattering.
\v 24 whenever the unclean spirit /may/_come_out from the person, ˱it˲_/is/_passing_through through waterless places seeking rest, and not finding, ˱it˲_/is/_saying, ‘˱I˲_/will_be/_returning to the house ˱of˲_me, whence ˱I˲_came_out.’
\v 25 And /having/_come, ˱it˲_/is/_finding \add it\add* /having_been/_swept and /having_been/_adorned.
\v 26 Then ˱it˲_/is/_going and /is/_taking seven other spirits more_evil \add than\add* itself, and /having/_come_in, /is/_dwelling there, and the last - ˱of˲_> that <_person /is/_becoming, worse \add than\add* the first.”
\v 27 ¶ And ˱it˲_became at the \add time\add* him /to_be/_saying these \add things\add*, /a/_certain woman from the crowd /having/_lifted_up /a/_voice, said ˱to˲_him, “Blessed \add is\add* the womb - /having/_borne you, and /the/_breasts which ˱you˲_nursed.”
\v 28 But he said, “Indeed_rather, blessed \add are\add* the \add ones\add* hearing the word - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd* and keeping \add it\add*.”
\v 29 ¶ And the crowds /being/_increased, ˱he˲_began /to_be/_saying, “- this generation is evil generation; ˱it˲_/is/_seeking /a/_sign and /a/_sign /will_ not _be_being/_given ˱to˲_it, except - the sign ˱of˲_Jonah.
\v 30 For as Jonah became /a/_sign ˱to˲_the Ninevites, thus the Son - ˱of˲_Man also will_be - ˱to˲_> this <_generation.
\v 31 /The/_queen ˱of˲_/the/_south /will_be_being/_raised at the judgment with the men - this generation, and /will_be/_condemning them, because ˱she˲_came from the ends ˱of˲_the earth /to/_hear the wisdom ˱of˲_Solomon, and behold, ˱one˲_greater \add than\add* Solomon \add is\add* here.
\v 32 Ninevites men /will_be/_standing_up at the judgment with - this generation, and ˱they˲_/will_be/_condemning it, because ˱they˲_repented at the proclamation ˱of˲_Jonah, and behold, ˱one˲_greater \add than\add* Jonah \add is\add* here.
\v 33 no_one /having/_lit /a/_lamp /is/_putting \add it\add* in /a/_hidden_place, nor under the basket, but on the lampstand, in_order_that the \add ones\add* entering_in /may_be/_seeing the light.
\v 34 The lamp ˱of˲_the body is the eye ˱of˲_you. Whenever the eye ˱of˲_you may_be healthy, all the body ˱of˲_you is also bright; but when evil may_be, the body ˱of˲_you \add is\add* also dark.
\v 35 Therefore /be/_looking_out, lest the light - in you is darkness.
\v 36 Therefore if the whole body ˱of˲_you \add is\add* bright, not having any dark part, ˱it˲_will_ all _be bright, as whenever the lamp /may_be/_illuminating you - ˱with˲_shining.”
\v 37 ¶ And at the \add time\add* /to/_speak, /a/_Pharisee /is/_asking him so_that ˱he˲_/may/_eat_breakfast with him, and /having/_come_in, ˱he˲_sat_down.
\v 38 And the Pharisee /having/_seen \add it\add*, marveled that ˱he˲_/was/_=> not first <=_washed before the dinner.
\v 39 But the \nd Lord\nd* said to him, “Now you_all - Pharisees /are/_cleansing the \add part\add* outside ˱of˲_the cup and ˱of˲_the platter, and - inside ˱of˲_you_all /is/_being_full ˱of˲_theft and wickedness.
\v 40 Foolish! Not the \add one\add* /having/_made the_> outside <_\add part\add*, also made the_> inside <_\add part\add*?
\v 41 However give ˱as˲_alms the \add things\add* being_within, and behold, all \add things\add* is clean ˱to˲_you_all.
\v 42 ¶ But woe ˱to˲_you_all - Pharisees, because ˱you_all˲_/are/_tithing - mint, and - rue, and every garden_plant, and ˱you_all˲_/are/_passing_by the justice and the love - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*. And these \add things\add* ˱it˲_/was/_fitting /to/_do, and_those \add things\add* /to/_=> not <=_neglect.
\v 43 Woe ˱to˲_you_all - Pharisees, because ˱you_all˲_/are/_loving the best_seat in the synagogues, and the greetings in the marketplaces.
\v 44 Woe ˱to˲_you_all, because ˱you_all˲_are as - - unseen tombs, and the people walking over ˱they˲_/have/_=> not <=_known \add it\add*.”
\v 45 ¶ And someone ˱of˲_the lawyers answering /is/_saying ˱to˲_him, “Teacher, saying these \add things\add*, ˱you˲_/are/_insulting us also.”
\v 46 But he said, woe also ˱to˲_you_all the lawyers! Because ˱you_all˲_/are/_burdening the people ˱with˲_> unbearable <_burdens, and you_all yourselves ˱you_all˲_/are/_=> not <=_touching ˱upon˲_the burdens ˱with˲_one ˱of˲_the fingers ˱of˲_you_all.
\v 47 Woe ˱to˲_you_all, because ˱you_all˲_/are/_building the tombs ˱of˲_the prophets, but the fathers ˱of˲_you_all killed_ them _off.
\v 48 Consequently ˱you_all˲_/are/_testifying and ˱you_all˲_/are/_consenting ˱to˲_the works ˱of˲_the fathers ˱of˲_you_all, because they on_one_hand killed_ them _off, on_the_other_hand you_all /are/_building \add their_tombs\add*.
\v 49 Because_of this the wisdom - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd* also said, ‘˱I˲_/will_be/_sending_out prophets and ambassadors to them, and ˱they˲_/will_be/_killing_off and ˱they˲_/will_be/_persecuting of them,
\v 50 in_order_that the blood ˱of˲_all the prophets, - /being/_poured_out from /the/_foundation ˱of˲_/the/_world /may_be/_sought_out, from - this generation,

\v 53 ¶ And_from_there ˱of˲_him ˱of˲_/having/_come_out, the scribes and the Pharisees began /to_be/_resenting \add him\add* terribly, and /to_be/_interrogating him about more \add things\add*,
\v 54 lying_in_wait him /to/_catch something out_of the mouth ˱of˲_him.
\c 12
\v 1 ¶ In which \add things\add* the myriads ˱of˲_the crowd, /having_been/_gathered_together, so_as /to_be/_trampling one_another, ˱he˲_began /to_be/_saying to the disciples ˱of˲_him first, “/Be/_taking_heed ˱to˲_yourselves of the leaven, ˱of˲_the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.
\v 2 But ˱there˲_is nothing /having_been/_covered_up, which /will_ not _be_being/_revealed, and hidden which /will_ not _be_being/_known.
\v 3 Instead_of that as_much_as ˱you_all˲_said in the darkness, /will_be_being/_heard in the light, and what ˱you_all˲_spoke to the ear in the private_rooms, /will_be_being/_proclaimed on the housetops.

\v 6 /are_ not five sparrows _being/_sold ˱for˲_> two <_assarions? And not one of them is /having_been/_forgotten before - \nd God\nd*.

\v 13 ¶ And someone from the crowd said ˱to˲_him, “Teacher, tell ˱to˲_the brother ˱of˲_me /to/_divide the inheritance with me.”
\v 14 But he ˱he˲_said ˱to˲_him, “Man, who me appointed /a/_judge or arbitrator over you_all?”
\v 15 And ˱he˲_said to them, “/Be/_watching and /be/_keeping from all greediness, because the life ˱of˲_him is not in the \add thing\add* /to_be/_abounding ˱to˲_anyone, of the \add things\add* possessing ˱to˲_him.”
\v 16 And ˱he˲_spoke /a/_parable to them saying, “The land ˱of˲_/a/_=> certain rich <=_man yielded_well.
\v 17 And ˱he˲_/was/_reasoning by himself saying, ‘What ˱I˲_/may/_do, because ˱I˲_/am/_=> not <=_having where ˱I˲_/will_be/_gathering_together the fruits ˱of˲_me?’
\v 18 And ˱he˲_said, ‘This ˱I˲_/will_be/_doing: ˱I˲_/will_be/_taking_down the barns and greater \add barns\add* ˱of˲_me and ˱I˲_/will_be/_building, ˱I˲_/will_be/_gathering_together there all the grain and the good \add things\add* ˱of˲_me.

\v 20 But - \nd God\nd* said ˱to˲_him, ‘Foolish, ˱on˲_this - night, requesting of you the soul ˱of˲_you; and what ˱you˲_prepared, ˱to˲_whom ˱it˲_will_be?’

\v 22 ¶ And ˱he˲_said to the disciples “Because_of this ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all, /be/_=> not <=_worrying ˱for˲_your life, what ˱you_all˲_/may/_eat nor ˱for˲_the body what ˱you_all˲_/may/_dress_in.
\v 23 For your life is more \add than\add* the food, and the body \add than\add* the clothing.
\v 24 Observe the ravens, because ˱they˲_/are/_=> not <=_sowing nor /are/_˱they˲_reaping, ˱to˲_which not is /a/_storeroom nor barn, and - \nd God\nd* /is/_feeding them. ˱For˲_how_much more you_all /are/_carrying_value \add than\add* the birds!

\v 27 Observe the lilies how ˱it˲_/is/_growing, neither ˱it˲_/is/_laboring nor ˱it˲_/is/_spinning; but ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all, not_even Solomon in all the glory ˱of˲_him, clothed as one ˱of˲_these.

\v 1 ¶ And some /were/_being_present at /the/_same - time, reporting ˱to˲_him about the Galileans, ˱of˲_whom the blood Pilate mixed with the sacrifices ˱of˲_them.

\v 12 And /having/_seen her, - \nd Jesus\nd* calling_out and said ˱to˲_her, “Woman, ˱you˲_/have_been/_sent_away ˱from˲_the sickness ˱of˲_you.”
\v 13 And ˱he˲_laid_on his hands ˱on˲_her, and immediately ˱she˲_/was/_restored and /was/_glorifying - \nd God\nd*.
\v 14 But the synagogue_leader answering, resenting because - \nd Jesus\nd* healed ˱on˲_the Sabbath, ˱he˲_/was/_saying ˱to˲_the crowd, because “Six days are in which ˱it˲_/is/_fitting /to_be/_working; therefore coming in them /be_being/_healed, and not ˱on˲_the day ˱of˲_the Sabbath.”
\v 15 And the \nd Lord\nd* answered ˱to˲_him and said, “Hypocrites! /Is/_=> not <=_untying each ˱of˲_you_all the ox ˱of˲_him, ˱on˲_the Sabbath, or the donkey from the manger, and /having/_led_away \add it\add* /is/_giving_to_drink \add it\add*?

\v 27 Whoever not /is/_bearing the cross ˱of˲_him and /is/_coming after me, /is/_=> not <=_able to_be /a/_disciple ˱of˲_me.
\v 28 For which of you_all wanting /to/_build /a/_tower, not first /having/_sat_down, /is/_counting the cost, whether ˱he˲_/is/_having \add enough\add* for /the/_completion?
\v 29 In_order_that lest /having/_laid /a/_foundation ˱of˲_it and not being_able /to/_finish \add it\add*, all - observing \add it\add* /may/_begin /to_be/_mocking ˱at˲_him
\v 30 saying, - ‘This - man began /to_be/_building, and was_ not _able /to/_finish \add it\add*.’
\v 31 Or what king going /to/_encounter ˱with˲_another king in war, not /having/_sat_down first /will_be/_counselling whether ˱he˲_is powerful with ten thousands /to/_meet ˱with˲_the \add one\add* with twenty thousands coming against him?
\v 32 And if not surely still ˱of˲_him being far_away, /having/_sent_out /a/_delegation /is/_asking peace.
\v 33 Therefore thus everyone of you_all who /is/_=> not <=_bidding_goodbye ˱to˲_all the \add things\add* possessing ˱of˲_himself, /is/_=> not <=_able to_be /a/_disciple ˱of˲_me.
\v 34 ¶ Therefore the salt \add is\add* good, but if the salt /may_be/_made_tasteless, with what ˱it˲_/will_be_being/_seasoned?
\v 35 ˱It˲_is neither suitable for soil nor for manure; ˱they˲_/are/_casting it out. The \add one\add* having ears /to_be/_hearing, /let_˱him˲_/be_hearing.”
\c 15
\v 1 ¶ And all the tax_collectors and the sinners were nearing ˱to˲_him /to_be/_hearing ˱from˲_him.
\v 2 And both the Pharisees and the scribes /were/_grumbling saying, - “This \add man\add* /is/_accepting sinners and /is/_eating_with ˱with˲_them.”
\v 3 And ˱he˲_said to them - this parable saying,
\v 4 “What person of you_all, having /a/_hundred sheep and /having/_lost one of them, /is/_=> not <=_leaving the ninety nine in the desert, and /is/_going after the \add sheep\add* /having/_lost, until ˱he˲_/may/_find it?
\v 5 And /having/_found \add it\add*, ˱he˲_/is/_laying_on \add it\add* on the shoulders ˱of˲_him rejoicing.
\v 6 And /having/_come to the /the/_house, ˱he˲_/is/_calling_together his friends and his neighbors, saying ˱to˲_them, ‘/Be/_rejoicing_with ˱with˲_me, because ˱I˲_found the sheep ˱of˲_me - /having/_been_lost!’
\v 7 ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all that thus joy in - heaven will_be over one sinner repenting, than over ninety nine righteous \add ones\add*, who /are/_having no need ˱of˲_repentance.
\v 8 ¶ Or what woman having ten drachmas, if ˱she˲_/may/_lose one drachma, /is/_=> not <=_lighting /a/_lamp, and /is/_sweeping the house, and /is/_seeking carefully, until ˱of˲_which ˱she˲_/may/_find \add it\add*?
\v 9 And /having/_found \add it\add*, /is/_calling_together her friends and neighbors saying, ‘/Be/_rejoicing_with ˱with˲_me, because ˱I˲_found the drachma that ˱I˲_lost.’
\v 10 Thus ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all, ˱there˲_/is/_becoming joy before the angels - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd* over one sinner repenting.”
\v 11 ¶ And ˱he˲_said, “/A/_=> certain <=_man /was/_having two sons.
\v 12 And the younger ˱of˲_them said ˱to˲_the father, ‘Father, give ˱to˲_me the breaking_down portion ˱of˲_the estate.’ he and ˱he˲_divided the living ˱to˲_them.
\v 13 And after not many days /having/_gathered_together all, the younger son traveled into /a/_=> distant <=_country, and there scattered the estate ˱of˲_him, living intemperately.
\v 14 But /having/_spent all \add things\add* ˱of˲_him, ˱there˲_became /a/_=> mighty <=_famine throughout - that country, and he began /to_be_being/_deficient.
\v 15 And /having_been/_gone, ˱he˲_/was/_joined_together ˱to˲_one ˱of˲_the citizens - ˱of˲_> that <_country, and ˱he˲_sent him into the fields ˱of˲_him /to_be/_feeding pigs.
\v 16 And ˱he˲_/was/_desiring /to_be/_satisfied from the carob_pods which the pigs /were/_eating, and no_one /was/_giving ˱to˲_him.
\v 17 To but himself /having/_come ˱he˲_/was/_saying, ‘How_many hired \add ones\add* ˱of˲_the father ˱of˲_me /are/_abounding ˱of˲_bread, but I /am/_perishing ˱with˲_famine here?
\v 18 /Having/_risen_up, ˱I˲_/will_be/_going to the father ˱of˲_me, and ˱I˲_/will_be/_saying ˱to˲_him, “Father, ˱I˲_sinned against - heaven and before you,

\v 20 And /having/_risen_up, ˱he˲_came to the father ˱of˲_himself. But still being_ far _away ˱from˲_him, the father ˱of˲_him saw him, and /was/_feeling_compassion, and /having/_run, embraced on the neck ˱of˲_him and kissed him.
\v 21 And the son said ˱to˲_him, ‘Father, ˱I˲_sinned against - heaven and before you, ˱I˲_am no_longer worthy /to_be/_called /a/_son ˱of˲_you.’
\v 22 But the father said to the slaves ˱of˲_him, ‘Quickly bring_out - first robe, and dress_ him _in, and give /a/_ring for the hand ˱of˲_him, and sandals for his feet,
\v 23 and /be/_bringing the - grain_fed calf, sacrifice \add it\add*, and /having/_eaten ˱we˲_/may_be/_gladdened.
\v 24 Because this - son ˱of˲_me was dead and revived, was /having_been/_lost and /was/_found.’ And ˱they˲_began /to_be_being/_gladdened.
\v 25 ¶ And the - elder son ˱of˲_him was in /the/_field; and while coming, ˱he˲_neared ˱to˲_the house, ˱he˲_heard ˱of˲_music and dancing.
\v 26 And /having/_called_to one ˱of˲_the servants, ˱he˲_/was/_inquiring what - might_be these \add things\add*.
\v 27 And he said ˱to˲_him, - ‘The brother ˱of˲_you /is/_coming, and the father ˱of˲_you sacrificed the - grain_fed calf, because ˱he˲_took_back being_sound him.’
\v 28 But ˱he˲_/was/_angered and ˱he˲_/was/_=> not <=_wanting /to/_come_in. And the father ˱of˲_him /having/_come_out, /was/_imploring him.
\v 29 And he answering said ˱to˲_the father ˱of˲_him, ‘Behold, so_many years ˱I˲_/am/_serving ˱for˲_you, and ˱I˲_> never <_passed_by /a/_commandment ˱of˲_you, and ˱you˲_> never <_gave /a/_young_goat ˱to˲_me, in_order_that ˱I˲_/may_be/_gladdened with the friends ˱of˲_me.
\v 30 But when - this son ˱of˲_you, ˱he˲_came - /having/_devoured the living ˱of˲_you with prostitutes, ˱you˲_sacrificed - grain_fed calf ˱for˲_him!’
\v 31 And he said ˱to˲_him, ‘Child, you are always with me, and all the \add things\add* mine \add is\add* is yours.
\v 32 But ˱it˲_/was/_fitting /to_be/_gladdened also /to_be/_elated, because - this brother ˱of˲_you, was dead and lived \add again\add*, and /having/_lost and ˱he˲_/was/_found.’”
\c 16
\v 1 ¶ And ˱he˲_/was/_saying also to the disciples, “/A/_=> certain <=_man was rich, who /was/_having /a/_manager, and this \add one\add* /was/_accused ˱to˲_him as scattering the \add things\add* possessing ˱of˲_him.
\v 2 And /having/_called him, ˱he˲_said ˱to˲_him, ‘What \add is\add* this ˱I˲_/am/_hearing concerning you? Give_back the account ˱of˲_the management ˱of˲_you, for ˱you˲_/are/_=> not <=_being_able anymore /to_be/_managing.’
\v 3 And the manager said by himself, ‘What /may/_˱I˲_do, because the master ˱of˲_me /is/_taking_away the management from me? ˱I˲_/am/_=> not <=_able /To_be/_digging, and ˱I˲_/am/_being_ashamed /to_be/_begging.
\v 4 ˱I˲_knew what ˱I˲_/may/_do, in_order_that whenever ˱I˲_/may_be/_removed from the management, ˱they˲_/may/_receive me into the homes ˱of˲_them.’
\v 5 And /having/_called_to each one ˱of˲_the debtors ˱of˲_the master ˱of˲_himself, ˱he˲_/was/_saying ˱to˲_the first, ‘How_much ˱you˲_/are/_owing ˱to˲_the master ˱of˲_me?’
\v 6 And he said, ‘/A/_hundred baths ˱of˲_olive_oil.’ And he said ˱to˲_him, ‘Receive ˱of˲_you the bills and /having/_sat_down quickly write fifty.’
\v 7 Then ˱to˲_another ˱he˲_said, ‘And how_much /are/_=> you <=_owing?’ And he said, ‘/A/_hundred cors ˱of˲_wheat.’ ˱He˲_/is/_saying ˱to˲_him, ‘Receive ˱of˲_you the bills and write eighty.’
\v 8 And the master praised the manager - ˱of˲_unrighteousness, because ˱he˲_performed prudently. Because the sons - ˱of˲_> this <_age are more_prudently beyond the sons ˱of˲_the light in the generation - ˱of˲_themselves.
\v 9 And I /am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all, make friends ˱for˲_yourselves by the money - ˱of˲_unrighteousness, in_order_that whenever ˱it˲_/may/_fail, ˱they˲_/may/_receive you_all into the eternal dwellings.
\v 10 ¶ The \add one\add* faithful with /the/_least, is also faithful with much, and the \add one\add* unrighteous with /the/_least, is also unrighteous with much.
\v 11 Therefore if ˱you_all˲_became not faithful with - unrighteous money, who /will_be/_entrusting - true \add wealth\add* ˱to˲_you_all?
\v 12 And if ˱you_all˲_became not faithful with the stranger, who /will_be/_giving the_> your <_\add things\add* ˱to˲_you_all?
\v 13 Not_one house_servant /is/_able /to_be/_serving ˱for˲_two masters, for either ˱he˲_/will_be/_hating the one, and the other ˱he˲_/will_be/_loving, or ˱of˲_/the/_one ˱he˲_/will_be/_upholding, and ˱of˲_the other ˱he˲_/will_be/_despising. ˱You_all˲_/are/_=> not <=_being_able /to_be/_serving ˱for˲_\nd God\nd* and money.”
\v 14 ¶ And all the Pharisees /were/_hearing these \add things\add*, being money_lovers, and ˱they˲_/were/_sneering_at him.
\v 15 And ˱he˲_said ˱to˲_them, “You_all are the \add ones\add* justifying yourselves before the people, but - \nd God\nd* /is/_knowing the hearts ˱of˲_you_all; because the \add thing\add* exalted among people, /an/_abomination \add is\add* before - \nd God\nd*.
\v 16 ¶ The law and the prophets \add were\add* until John; from then the Kingdom - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd* /is_being/_gospel_preached, and everyone /is/_forcing into it.
\v 17 But ˱it˲_is easier - ˱for˲_heaven and - earth /to/_pass_away, than one serif ˱of˲_the law /to/_fall.
\v 18 ¶ Everyone - sending_away the wife ˱of˲_him and marrying another, /is/_committing_adultery, and every the \add one\add* marrying /having_been/_sent_away from /a/_husband, /is/_committing_adultery.
\v 19 ¶ And ¶ /a/_=> certain <=_man was rich, and /was/_dressing_in purple and linen, /being/_gladdened splendidly in_every day.
\v 20 And /a/_=> certain <=_poor \add man\add* ˱by˲_/the/_name Lazarus, /had_been/_laid at the gate ˱of˲_him, /having_been/_ulcerated
\v 21 and desiring /to_be/_satisfied from - falling from the table ˱of˲_the rich \add man\add*; but even the dogs coming /were/_licking_up the ulcers ˱of˲_him.
\v 22 And ˱it˲_became the poor \add man\add* /to/_die_off, and him /to_be/_carried_away by the angels into the bosom ˱of˲_Abraham. And the rich \add man\add* died_off also and /was/_buried.
\v 23 And in - Hades /having/_lifted_up the eyes ˱of˲_him, being in torments, ˱he˲_/is/_seeing Abraham from afar, and Lazarus in the bosoms ˱of˲_him.
\v 24 And he /having/_called said, Father ‘Abraham, show_mercy ˱to˲_me and send Lazarus, in_order_that ˱he˲_/may/_dip the extremity ˱of˲_the finger ˱of˲_him ˱in˲_water, and /may/_cool_down the tongue ˱of˲_me, because ˱I˲_/am_being/_distressed in - this flame.’
\v 25 But Abraham said, ‘Child, /be/_reminded that ˱you˲_took_back the good ˱of˲_you in the life ˱of˲_you, and Lazarus likewise the evil. But now here ˱he˲_/is_being/_comforted, and you /are_being/_distressed.
\v 26 And among all these \add things\add*, between us and you_all /a/_chasm great /has_been/_established, so_that the \add ones\add* wanting /to/_pass_through here to you_all /may_ not _be/_able, nor /may_be/_crossing_over from_there to us.’
\v 27 And, ˱he˲_said, therefore ˱I˲_/am/_asking you Father, that ˱you˲_/may/_send him to the house ˱of˲_the father ˱of˲_me,
\v 28 for ˱I˲_/am/_having five brothers, so_that ˱he˲_/may_be/_testifying ˱to˲_them, in_order_that they /may/_=> not also <=_come to - this place - ˱of˲_torment.’
\v 29 But Abraham /is/_saying, ‘˱They˲_/are/_having Moses and the prophets; ˱them˲_/let/_hear ˱from˲_them.’
\v 30 And he said, ‘No, Father Abraham, but if someone from /the/_dead /may_be/_gone to them, ˱they˲_/will_be/_repenting.’
\v 31 But ˱he˲_said ˱to˲_him, ‘If ˱they˲_/are/_=> not <=_hearing ˱from˲_Moses and the prophets, not_even if someone from /the/_dead /may/_rise_up, ˱they˲_/will_be_being/_persuaded.’”
\c 17
\v 1 ¶ And ˱he˲_said to the disciples ˱of˲_him, “˱It˲_is impossible ˱of˲_which the temptations /to/_=> not <=_come, however woe \add to_him\add* by whom ˱it˲_/is/_coming!

\v 3 /Be/_taking_heed ˱to˲_yourselves! If the brother ˱of˲_you /may/_sin, give_rebuke ˱to˲_him, and if ˱he˲_/may/_repent, forgive ˱to˲_him.
\v 4 And if ˱he˲_/may/_sin against you seven_times ˱in˲_the day, and seven_times ˱he˲_/may/_return to you, saying ‘˱I˲_/am/_repenting’, ˱you˲_/will_be/_forgiving ˱to˲_him.”
\v 5 ¶ And the ambassadors said ˱to˲_the \nd Lord\nd*, “Add faith ˱to˲_us!”
\v 6 And the \nd Lord\nd* said, “If ˱you_all˲_/are/_having faith as /a/_seed ˱of˲_mustard, ˱you_all˲_> would <_/were/_saying - ˱to˲_mulberry_tree this, ‘/Be/_uprooted and /be/_planted in the sea’, and ˱it˲_> would <_submitted ˱to˲_you_all.
\v 7 ¶ And which of you_all having /a/_slave, plowing or shepherding, who /having/_come_in out_of the field /will_be/_saying ˱to˲_him, ‘/Having/_come_up immediately sit_down \add to_eat\add*’?
\v 8 But not ˱he˲_/will_be/_saying ˱to˲_him, ‘Prepare what ˱I˲_/may/_dine, and /having/_girded_about /be/_serving ˱unto˲_me, until ˱I˲_/may/_eat and ˱I˲_/may/_drink, and after these \add things\add* you /will_be/_eating and /will_be/_drinking’?

\v 13 And they lifted_up /their/_voice saying, “\nd Jesus\nd*, Master, show_mercy ˱to˲_us.”
\v 14 And /having/_seen \add them\add*, ˱he˲_said ˱to˲_them, “/Having_been/_gone show yourselves ˱to˲_the priests.” And ˱it˲_became at the \add time\add* /to_be/_going ˱to˲_them, ˱they˲_/were/_cleansed.
\v 15 And one of them /having/_seen that ˱he˲_/was/_healed, returned with /a/_=> loud <=_voice glorifying - \nd God\nd*,

\v 19 And ˱he˲_said ˱to˲_him, “/Having/_stood_up, /be/_going; the faith ˱of˲_you /has/_healed you!”
\v 20 ¶ And /having_been/_asked by the Pharisees when the Kingdom - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd* /is/_coming, ˱he˲_answered ˱to˲_them and said, the Kingdom - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd* “/Is/_=> not <=_coming with observation,

\v 22 And ˱he˲_said to the disciples, “Days /will_be/_coming when ˱you_all˲_/will_be/_desiring /to/_see one ˱of˲_the days ˱of˲_the Son - ˱of˲_Man, and ˱you_all˲_/will_ not _be/_seeing \add it\add*.
\v 23 And ˱they˲_/will_be/_saying ˱to˲_you_all, ‘Behold, there \add he_is\add*’, or, ‘Behold, here \add he_is\add*’; ˱you_all˲_/may/_=> not <=_pursue.
\v 24 For as the lightning flashing from the \add one_part\add* under the sky /is/_shining to the \add one_part\add* under sky, thus the Son - ˱of˲_Man will_be.
\v 25 But first ˱it˲_/is/_fitting him /to/_suffer many \add things\add*, and /to_be/_rejected by - this generation.
\v 26 And as ˱it˲_became in the days ˱of˲_Noah, thus ˱it˲_will_be also in the days ˱of˲_the Son - ˱of˲_Man:
\v 27 ˱they˲_/were/_eating, ˱they˲_/were/_drinking, ˱they˲_/were/_marrying, ˱they˲_/were_being/_betrothed, until that day Noah came_in into the ark, and the flood came and destroyed all.
\v 28 Likewise as ˱it˲_became in the days ˱of˲_Lot: ˱they˲_/were/_eating, ˱they˲_/were/_drinking, ˱they˲_/were/_buying, ˱they˲_/were/_selling, ˱they˲_/were/_planting, ˱they˲_/were/_building;
\v 29 but ˱in˲_that day Lot came_out from Sodom, fire and brimstone rained from /the/_sky and destroyed all.
\v 30 So ˱it˲_will_be according_to ˱in˲_that day, the Son - ˱of˲_Man /is_being/_revealed.
\v 31 In that - day, who will_be on the housetop, and the goods ˱of˲_him in his house, ˱him˲_/let/_=> not <=_come_down /to/_take_away them, and the \add one\add* in /the/_field, likewise ˱him˲_/let/_=> not <=_return to the \add things\add* back.

\v 36
\v 37 And answering ˱they˲_/are/_saying ˱to˲_him, “Where, \nd Lord\nd*?” And he said ˱to˲_them, “Where the body \add is\add*, there also the vultures /will_be_being/_gathered_together.”

\v 4 And ˱he˲_/was/_=> not <=_willing for /a/_time, but after these \add things\add* ˱he˲_said to himself, ‘Even if ˱I˲_/am/_=> not <=_revering - \nd God\nd* nor ˱I˲_/am_being/_swayed /a/_person,

\v 9 ¶ And ˱he˲_> also <_spoke - this parable to some - /having/_trusted in themselves that ˱they˲_are righteous and scorning the others:
\v 10 “Two men went_up into the temple /to/_pray, - one \add was\add* /a/_Pharisee, and the other \add was\add* /a/_tax_collector.
\v 11 The Pharisee /having_been/_stood /was/_praying these \add things\add* to himself: ‘- \nd God\nd*, ˱I˲_/am/_giving_thanks ˱to˲_you that ˱I˲_am not as the rest ˱of˲_the people, swindling, unrighteous, adulterers, or even as this - tax_collector.
\v 12 ˱I˲_/am/_fasting twice - ˱of˲_/a/_week, ˱I˲_/am/_tithing all \add things\add*, as_many_as ˱I˲_/am/_acquiring.’
\v 13 But the tax_collector /having/_stood afar, /was/_=> not <=_willing not_even his eyes /to/_lift_up to the sky, but /was/_striking the chest ˱of˲_him saying, ‘- \nd God\nd*, /be/_made_atonement ˱for˲_me, the sinner!’
\v 14 ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all, this \add one\add* came_down to the house ˱of˲_himself /having_been/_justified, contrary_to that \add one\add*. Because everyone - exalting himself /will_be_being/_humbled, but the \add one\add* humbling himself /will_be_being/_exalted.”
\v 15 ¶ And ˱they˲_/were/_=> also <=_bringing the babies ˱to˲_him, in_order_that ˱he˲_/may_be/_touching ˱against˲_them; but the disciples /having/_seen, /were/_giving_rebuke ˱to˲_them.
\v 16 But - \nd Jesus\nd* called_to saying, “Allow the little_children /to_be/_coming to me, and /be/_=> not <=_forbidding them, for the Kingdom - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd* is - ˱of˲_such.
\v 17 Truly, ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all, whoever - /may/_=> not <=_receive the Kingdom - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd* as /a/_little_child, by_no_means /may/_=> not <=_come_in into it.”
\v 18 ¶ And /a/_certain ruler asked him saying, “Good Teacher, /having/_done what, ˱I˲_/will_be/_inheriting life eternal?”
\v 19 And - \nd Jesus\nd* said ˱to˲_him, “Why /are/_˱you˲_calling me good? No_one \add is\add* good, except - one \nd God\nd*.
\v 20 ˱You˲_/have/_known the commandments: ‘˱you˲_/may/_=> not <=_commit_adultery, ˱you˲_/may/_=> not <=_murder, ˱you˲_/may/_=> not <=_steal, ˱you˲_/may/_=> not <=_give_false_testimony’, ‘/be/_honoring the father and the mother ˱of˲_you.’”
\v 21 And he said, ˱I˲_kept all these \add things\add* from /the/_youth ˱of˲_me.”
\v 22 And - \nd Jesus\nd* /having/_heard, said ˱to˲_him, “Still one \add thing\add* /is/_lacking ˱to˲_you; all as_much_as ˱you˲_/are/_having, sell and distribute ˱to˲_/the/_poor, and ˱you˲_/will_be/_having treasure in /the/_heavens, and come, /be/_following ˱after˲_me.”
\v 23 But he /having/_heard these \add things\add*, /was/_become very_sorrowful, for ˱he˲_was exceedingly rich.
\v 24 And - \nd Jesus\nd* /having/_seen him, said, “How difficultly the \add ones\add* having - wealth, /will_be/_coming_in into the Kingdom - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*.
\v 25 For is easier /a/_camel /to/_come_in through /an/_eye ˱of˲_/a/_needle, than /a/_rich \add man\add* /to/_come_in into the Kingdom - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*.”
\v 26 And they /having/_heard said, “And who /is/_able /to_be/_saved?”
\v 27 But he said, “The \add things\add* impossible with humans, is possible with - \nd God\nd*.”
\v 28 ¶ And - Peter said, “Behold, we left all and followed ˱after˲_you.”
\v 29 And he said ˱to˲_them, “Truly, ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all that ˱there˲_is no_one who left house, or wife, or brothers, or parents, or children, on_account the Kingdom - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*,
\v 30 who by_no_means /may/_=> not <=_take_back many_times_more in - this time, and in the - coming age, eternal life.”
\v 31 ¶ And /having/_taken the twelve, ˱he˲_said to them, “Behold, ˱we˲_/are/_going_up to Jerusalem, and all the \add things\add* /having_been/_written by the prophets ˱about˲_the Son - ˱of˲_Man /will_be_being/_accomplished.
\v 32 For ˱he˲_/will_be_being/_given_over ˱to˲_the pagans, and ˱he˲_/will_be_being/_mocked, and ˱he˲_/will_be_being/_insulted, and ˱he˲_/will_be_being/_spat_on.
\v 33 And /having/_flogged \add him\add*, ˱they˲_/will_be/_killing_ him _off, and ˱on˲_the - third day, ˱he˲_/will_be/_rising_up.”
\v 34 And they understood nothing ˱of˲_these \add things\add*, and - this word was /having_been/_hidden from them, and ˱they˲_/were/_=> not <=_knowing the \add things\add* /being/_spoken.
\v 35 ¶ And ˱it˲_became at the \add time\add* him /to_be/_nearing, to Jericho, /a/_=> certain <=_blind \add man\add* /was/_sitting beside the road begging.
\v 36 And /having/_heard ˱of˲_/a/_crowd passing_through, ˱he˲_/was/_inquiring what this might_be.
\v 37 And ˱they˲_reported ˱to˲_him, - “\nd Jesus\nd* the Nazarene /is/_passing_by.”
\v 38 And ˱he˲_shouted saying, “\nd Jesus\nd*, Son ˱of˲_David, show_mercy ˱to˲_me.”
\v 39 And the \add ones\add* going_before /were/_warning ˱to˲_him that ˱he˲_/may/_keep_silent. But he /was/_crying_out ˱by˲_much more, “Son ˱of˲_David, show_mercy ˱to˲_me.”
\v 40 And \nd Jesus\nd* /having_been/_stopped, commanded him /to_be/_brought to him. And /having/_neared him, ˱he˲_asked him,
\v 41 “What ˱you˲_/are/_wanting ˱I˲_/may/_do ˱for˲_you?” And he said, “\nd Lord\nd*, that ˱I˲_/may/_receive_sight.”
\v 42 And - \nd Jesus\nd* said ˱to˲_him, “Receive_sight; the faith ˱of˲_you /has/_healed you.”
\v 43 And immediately ˱he˲_received_sight, and /was/_following ˱after˲_him, glorifying - \nd God\nd*. And all the people /having/_seen \add it\add*, gave praise - ˱to˲_\nd God\nd*.
\c 19
\v 1 ¶ And /having/_come_in, ˱he˲_/was/_passing_through - Jericho.
\v 2 And behold, /a/_man /being/_called ˱by˲_/the/_name Zaccheus, and he was /a/_chief_tax_collector, and he \add was\add* rich.
\v 3 And ˱he˲_/was/_seeking /to/_see - who \nd Jesus\nd* is, and /was/_=> not <=_able because_of the crowd, because ˱he˲_was - small ˱in˲_stature.
\v 4 And /having/_run_ahead ahead, ˱he˲_went_up in /a/_sycamore_tree, in_order_that ˱he˲_/may/_see him, because ˱he˲_/was/_going /to_be/_passing_through ˱of˲_that \add way\add*.
\v 5 And as ˱he˲_came to the place, \nd Jesus\nd* /having/_looked_up, said to him, “Zaccheus, /having/_hurried come_down, for today ˱it˲_/is/_fitting me /to/_remain in the house ˱of˲_you.”
\v 6 And /having/_hurried, ˱he˲_came_down and welcomed him rejoicing.
\v 7 And all /having/_seen \add it\add*, /were/_grumbling saying, - “˱He˲_came_in /to/_lodge with /a/_sinful man.”
\v 8 And Zaccheus /having_been/_stood, said to the \nd Lord\nd*, “Behold, - half ˱of˲_the \add things\add* ˱of˲_me possessing, \nd Lord\nd*, ˱I˲_/am/_giving ˱to˲_the poor, and if ˱I˲_defrauded anything ˱of˲_anyone, ˱I˲_/am/_giving_back quadruple.”
\v 9 And - \nd Jesus\nd* said to him, - “Today salvation this - ˱to˲_house became, as_much_as he also is /a/_son ˱of˲_Abraham.
\v 10 For the Son - ˱of˲_Man came /to/_seek and /to/_save the \add thing\add* /having/_been_lost.”
\v 11 ¶ And ˱from˲_them hearing these \add things\add* /having/_proceeded, ˱he˲_said /a/_parable because_of that him to_be near ˱of˲_Jerusalem, and them /to_be/_supposing that the Kingdom - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd* /is/_=> immediately <=_going /to_be_being/_appeared.
\v 12 Therefore, ˱he˲_said, /a/_=> “certain noble <=_man /was/_gone to /a/_country distant, /to/_receive ˱for˲_himself /a/_kingdom and /to/_return.
\v 13 And /having/_called ten slaves ˱of˲_himself, ˱he˲_gave ten minas ˱to˲_them, and told to them, ‘/To/_do_business at the \add time\add* ˱I˲_/am/_coming.’
\v 14 But the citizens ˱of˲_him /were/_hating him, and ˱they˲_sent_out /a/_delegation after him saying, ‘˱We˲_/are/_=> not <=_willing this \add man\add* /to/_reign over us.’
\v 15 And ˱it˲_became on the \add way\add* ˱of˲_him /to/_return, /having/_received the kingdom, and ˱he˲_said the these slaves /to_be/_called ˱to˲_him ˱to˲_whom ˱he˲_/had/_given the silver, in_order_that ˱he˲_/may/_know what ˱they˲_bartered.
\v 16 And the first arrived saying, ‘Master, the mina ˱of˲_you, additionally_earned ten.’ minas.’
\v 17 And ˱he˲_said ˱to˲_him, ‘Well \add done\add* good slave! Because ˱you˲_became faithful in least, be having authority over ten cities.’
\v 18 And the second came saying, ‘The mina ˱of˲_you, Master, made five minas.’
\v 19 And ˱he˲_said also ˱to˲_this \add one\add*, ‘Also you /be/_becoming over five cities.’
\v 20 And - another came saying, ‘Master, behold, the mina ˱of˲_you, which ˱I˲_/was/_having lying_away in /a/_handkerchief.
\v 21 For ˱I˲_/was/_fearing you, because ˱you˲_are /a/_=> austere <=_man, ˱you˲_/are/_taking_up what ˱you˲_> not <_laid, and ˱you˲_/are/_reaping what ˱you˲_> not <_sowed.’
\v 22 ˱He˲_/is/_saying ˱to˲_him, ‘˱I˲_/will_be/_judging you out_of the mouth ˱of˲_you, evil slave. ˱You˲_/had/_known that I am /a/_=> austere <=_man, taking_up what ˱I˲_> not <_laid, and reaping what ˱I˲_> not <_sowed?
\v 23 And for_ why _reason ˱you˲_> not <_gave the silver ˱of˲_me to /the/_bank, and_I /having/_come, ˱I˲_collected - it with interest?’
\v 24 And ˱to˲_the \add ones\add* /having/_stood_by ˱he˲_said, ‘Take_away the mina from him, and give \add it\add* ˱to˲_the \add one\add*, having the ten minas.’
\v 25 And ˱they˲_said ˱to˲_him, Master ˱he˲_/is/_having ‘Ten, minas \add already\add*.’
\v 26 ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all that ˱to˲_everyone the \add one\add* having, /will_be_being/_given, but from the \add one\add* not having, even what ˱he˲_/is/_having /will_be_being/_taken_away.
\v 27 However these - enemies ˱of˲_me, the \add ones\add* not /having/_wanted me /to/_reign over them, bring here and strike_ them _down before me.”
\v 28 ¶ And /having/_said these \add things\add* ˱he˲_/was/_going ahead going_up to Jerusalem.
\v 29 ¶ And ˱it˲_became as ˱he˲_neared to Bethphage and Bethany, toward the mountain - /being/_called ˱of˲_Olives, ˱he˲_sent_out two ˱of˲_the disciples
\v 30 saying, “/Be/_going into the village ahead, in which entering_in ˱you_all˲_/will_be/_finding /a/_colt /having_been/_bound, on which no_one ever ˱of˲_people sat_down, and /having/_untied it, bring \add it\add*.
\v 31 And if anyone /may_be/_asking you_all, ‘for_ Why _reason ˱you_all˲_/are/_untying \add it\add*?’ Thus ˱you_all˲_/will_be/_saying, - ‘The \nd Lord\nd* /is/_having need ˱of˲_it.’”
\v 32 And /having/_gone_away they /having_been/_sent_out found \add it\add* as ˱he˲_said ˱to˲_them.
\v 33 And ˱of˲_them releasing the colt, the masters ˱of˲_it said to them, “Why /are/_˱you_all˲_untying the colt?”
\v 34 And they said, - “The \nd Lord\nd* /is/_having need ˱of˲_it.”
\v 35 And ˱they˲_led it to - \nd Jesus\nd*, and /having/_cast_on the clothes ˱of˲_them on the colt, - ˱they˲_mounted_> \nd Jesus\nd* <_\add on_it\add*.
\v 36 And ˱of˲_him going, ˱they˲_/were/_spreading_under the clothes ˱of˲_themselves on the road.
\v 37 And ˱of˲_him nearing already at the down_grade ˱of˲_the Mount - ˱of˲_Olives, all the multitude ˱of˲_the disciples began rejoicing /to_be/_praising - \nd God\nd* ˱with˲_/a/_=> loud <=_voice for all /the/_miracles which ˱they˲_saw
\v 38 saying, “‘/Having_been/_blessed \add is\add* the king the \add one\add* coming’; in /the/_name ˱of˲_/the/_\nd Lord\nd*’; in heaven peace and glory in /the/_highest.”
\v 39 And some ˱of˲_the Pharisees from the crowd said to him, “Teacher, give_rebuke ˱to˲_the disciples ˱of˲_you.”
\v 40 And answering ˱he˲_said, “˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all that if these /will_be/_keeping_silent, the stones /will_be/_crying_out.”
\v 41 ¶ And as ˱he˲_neared, /having/_seen the city, ˱he˲_wept over it
\v 42 saying, - “If ˱you˲_knew in - this day, even you, the \add things\add* for peace; but now ˱it˲_/was/_hidden from /the/_eyes ˱of˲_you.
\v 43 Because days /will_be/_coming on you, and the enemies ˱of˲_you /will_be/_throwing_around /a/_palisade ˱to˲_you, and ˱they˲_/will_be/_surrounding you and ˱they˲_/will_be/_pressing you on_every_side,

\v 45 ¶ And /having/_come_in into the temple, ˱he˲_began /to_be/_casting_out the \add ones\add* selling,
\v 46 saying ˱to˲_them, “˱It˲_/has_been/_written, ‘the house ˱of˲_me \add will_be\add* /a/_house ˱of˲_prayer’, but you_all made it ‘/a/_hideout ˱of˲_robbers’.”
\v 47 ¶ And ˱he˲_was teaching - in_every day in the temple; but the chief_priests and the scribes and the leaders ˱of˲_the people /were/_seeking, /to/_destroy him,
\v 48 and ˱they˲_/were/_=> not <=_finding - what ˱they˲_/may/_do, for the all /the/_people /was/_hanging_on hearing ˱of˲_him.
\c 20
\v 1 ¶ And ˱it˲_became on one ˱of˲_the days, ˱of˲_> him <_teaching the people in the temple, and gospel_preaching, the chief_priests and the scribes with the elders approached,
\v 2 and ˱they˲_spoke saying to him, “Tell ˱to˲_us by what authority ˱you˲_/are/_doing these \add things\add*, or who is the \add one\add* /having/_given this - authority ˱to˲_you?”
\v 3 And answering ˱he˲_said to them, “Also_I “/Will_be/_asking you_all /a/_word and tell ˱to˲_me:
\v 4 the baptism ˱of˲_John, was_˱it˲ from heaven or from humans?”
\v 5 And they /were/_reasoning_together to themselves saying, - “If ˱we˲_/may/_say, ‘From heaven’, ˱he˲_/will_be/_saying, ‘for_ Why _reason ˱you_all˲_> not <_believed ˱in˲_him?’
\v 6 But if ˱we˲_/may/_say, ‘From humans’, all the people /will_be/_stoning us, for /having_been/_persuaded John ˱he˲_is to_be /a/_prophet.”
\v 7 And ˱they˲_answered, /to_have/_=> not <=_known from_where.
\v 8 And - \nd Jesus\nd* said ˱to˲_them, “Neither /am/_=> I <=_telling ˱to˲_you_all by what authority ˱I˲_/am/_doing these \add things\add*.”
\v 9 ¶ And ˱he˲_began /to_be/_speaking this - parable to the ¶ people: “/A/_man planted /a/_vineyard, and rented_out it ˱to˲_tenant_farmers, and traveled many times.
\v 10 And ˱in˲_/the/_season ˱he˲_sent_out /a/_slave to the tenant_farmers, in_order_that ˱they˲_/will_be/_giving ˱to˲_him from the fruit ˱of˲_the vineyard. But the tenant_farmers /having/_beat \add him\add* sent_ him _away, empty-handed.
\v 11 And ˱he˲_proceeded /to/_send another slave; but they, /having/_beat and /having/_dishonored also_that \add one\add*, ˱they˲_sent_away \add him\add* empty-handed.
\v 12 And ˱he˲_proceeded /to/_send /a/_third; and they also /having/_wounded this \add one\add*, cast_out \add him\add*.
\v 13 And the master ˱of˲_the vineyard said, ‘What /may/_˱I˲_do? ˱I˲_/will_be/_sending the - beloved son ˱of˲_me; perhaps ˱they˲_/will_be_being/_swayed ˱by˲_this \add one\add*.’
\v 14 But /having/_seen him, the tenant_farmers /were/_reasoning to one_another saying, ‘This is the heir; ˱we˲_/may/_kill_ him _off, in_order_that the inheritance /may/_become ˱of˲_us.’
\v 15 And /having/_cast_ him _out outside the vineyard, ˱they˲_killed_off \add him\add*. Therefore what /will_ the master ˱of˲_the vineyard _be/_doing ˱to˲_them?
\v 16 ˱He˲_/will_be/_coming and /will_be/_destroying the these tenant_farmers, and /will_be/_giving the vineyard ˱to˲_others.” And /having/_heard ˱they˲_said, “Never /might/_˱it˲_become!”
\v 17 But he /having/_focused_in ˱on˲_them said, “Therefore what is this the \add word\add* /having_been/_written, ‘/the/_stone which the \add ones\add* building rejected, this /was/_become for /the/_head ˱of˲_/the/_corner’?
\v 18 Everyone - /having/_fallen on that - stone, /will_be_being/_shattered; but on whomever - ˱it˲_/may/_fall, ˱it˲_/will_be/_pulverizing him.”
\v 19 And the scribes and the chief_priests sought /to/_lay_on their hands on him, in /the/_same - hour, and ˱they˲_/were/_afraid the people, for ˱they˲_knew that ˱he˲_spoke - this parable against them.
\v 20 ¶ And /having/_watched_closely, ˱they˲_sent_out spies pretending themselves to_be righteous, in_order_that ˱they˲_/may/_catch ˱of˲_him ˱of˲_/a/_statement, so_that /to/_give_ him _over ˱to˲_the rule and - authority ˱of˲_the governor.
\v 21 And ˱they˲_asked him saying, “Teacher, ˱we˲_/have/_known that ˱you˲_/are/_saying correctly, and ˱you˲_/are/_teaching, and ˱you˲_/are/_=> not <=_receiving /any/_person, but ˱you˲_/are/_teaching the way - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd* in truth.
\v 22 /Is/_˱it˲_permitting ˱for˲_us /to/_give tax ˱to˲_Caesar or not?”
\v 23 But /having/_observed the craftiness ˱of˲_them, ˱he˲_said to them,
\v 24 “Show ˱to˲_me /the/_denarius; ˱of˲_whose image and inscription /is/_˱it˲_having?” and they said, “˱Of˲_Caesar.”
\v 25 And he ˱he˲_said to them, “So_now give_back the \add things\add* ˱of˲_Caesar ˱to˲_Caesar, and the \add things\add* - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd* - ˱to˲_\nd God\nd*.”
\v 26 And ˱they˲_were_ not _able /to/_catch ˱of˲_the \add one\add* ˱in˲_/a/_word before the people, and /having/_marveled at the answer ˱of˲_him, ˱they˲_kept_silent.
\v 27 ¶ And some ˱of˲_the Sadducees, the \add ones\add* saying ˱there˲_> not <_to_be /a/_resurrection /having/_approached, asked him
\v 28 saying, “Teacher, Moses wrote ˱to˲_us, ‘if brother ˱of˲_anyone /may/_die_off having /a/_wife, and this \add one\add* childless in_order_that the brother ˱of˲_him /may/_take his wife, and /may/_raise_up seed ˱to˲_the brother ˱of˲_him.’
\v 29 Therefore ˱there˲_were seven brothers; and the first, /having/_taken /a/_wife, died_off childless;
\v 30 and the second,
\v 31 and the third took her, and likewise also the seven, not left children, and ˱they˲_died_off.
\v 32 Last the woman also died_off.
\v 33 Therefore in the resurrection, ˱of˲_which ˱of˲_them /is/_˱she˲_becoming wife? For the seven had her ˱as˲_wife.”
\v 34 ¶ And - \nd Jesus\nd* said ˱to˲_them, “The sons - this ˱of˲_age /are/_marrying and /are_being/_betrothed,
\v 35 but the \add ones\add* /having_been/_considered_worthy that - ˱of˲_age, /to/_obtain and ˱of˲_the resurrection which \add is\add* from /the/_dead, /are/_=> neither <=_marrying nor /are_being/_betrothed;

\v 37 But that the dead /are_being/_raised, even Moses divulged at the thorn_bush, when ˱he˲_/is/_calling /the/_\nd Lord\nd*, ‘the \nd God\nd* ˱of˲_Abraham, and /the/_\nd God\nd* ˱of˲_Isaac, and /the/_\nd God\nd* ˱of˲_Jacob’.
\v 38 And \nd God\nd* is not ˱of˲_/the/_dead, but ˱of˲_/the/_living, for ˱to˲_him all /are/_living.”
\v 39 And some ˱of˲_the scribes answering said, “Teacher, ˱you˲_spoke well.”
\v 40 for ˱They˲_/were/_=> no_longer <=_daring /to_be/_asking him nothing.
\v 41 ¶ And ˱he˲_said to them, “How /are/_˱they˲_saying the \nd Messiah\nd* to_be Son ˱of˲_David?
\v 42 For David himself /is/_saying in /the/_scroll ˱of˲_Psalms, ‘the \nd Lord\nd* said ˱to˲_the \nd Lord\nd* ˱of˲_me, “/Be/_sitting on /the/_right \add hand\add* ˱of˲_me,
\v 43 until - ˱I˲_/may/_put the enemies ˱of˲_you ˱as˲_/a/_footstool ˱of˲_the feet ˱of˲_you.”’
\v 44 Therefore David, /is/_calling him ‘\nd Lord\nd*’, and how is_˱he˲ son ˱of˲_him?”
\v 45 ¶ And all the people hearing, ˱he˲_said ˱to˲_the disciples ˱of˲_him,
\v 46 “/Be/_taking_heed of the scribes - wanting /to_be/_walking in robes, and loving greetings in the marketplaces, and /the/_best_seats in the synagogues, and /the/_best_places at the suppers,
\v 47 who /are/_devouring the houses ˱of˲_the widows, and ˱they˲_/are/_praying long ˱for˲_/a/_under_pretense. These /will_be/_receiving more_abundant judgment.”
\c 21
\v 1 ¶ And /having/_looked_up, ˱he˲_saw /the/_rich the \add ones\add* casting the gifts ˱of˲_them into the treasury.
\v 2 And ˱he˲_saw /a/_certain poor widow, casting two leptons. there.
\v 3 And ˱he˲_said, “Truly ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all that - this - poor widow, cast more \add than\add* all;
\v 4 for all these cast in their gifts out_of the \add wealth\add* abounding ˱to˲_them, but this \add woman\add* cast out_of the need ˱of˲_her, all the living which ˱she˲_/was/_having.”
\v 5 ¶ And ˱as˲_some speaking about the temple that /has_been/_adorned ˱with˲_> good <_stones and ˱with˲_curses, ˱he˲_said,
\v 6 “These \add things\add* which ˱you_all˲_/are/_observing, days /will_be/_coming in which stone /will_ not _be_being/_left on stone, here, which /will_ not _be_being/_torn_down.”
\v 7 ¶ And ˱they˲_asked him saying, “Teacher, therefore when \add things\add* these will_be, and what the sign whenever these \add things\add* /may_be/_going /to_be/_becoming?”
\v 8 And he said, “/Be/_watching_out, lest ˱you_all˲_/may_be/_strayed; for many /will_be/_coming in the name ˱of˲_me saying, ‘I am \add he\add*’, and, ‘The time /has/_neared.’ ˱You_all˲_/may_ not _be/_gone after them.
\v 9 And whenever ˱you_all˲_/may/_hear wars and disturbances, ˱you_all˲_/may_ not _be/_terrified; for ˱it˲_/is/_fitting these \add things\add* /to/_become first, but the end not \add is\add* immediately.”
\v 10 Then ˱he˲_/was/_saying ˱to˲_them, “Nation /will_be_being/_raised against nation, and kingdom against kingdom,
\v 11 both great earthquakes, and in \add different\add* places, will_be famines and pestilences, and fearful_sights and from /the/_sky will_be great signs
\v 12 ¶ But before all these \add things\add*, ˱they˲_/will_be/_laying_on on you_all the hands ˱of˲_them, and ˱they˲_/will_be/_persecuting, giving_over to the synagogues and prisons, /being/_led_away before kings and governors, on_account the name ˱of˲_me.
\v 13 ˱it˲_/will_be/_turning_out /a/_testimony for ˱to˲_you_all.
\v 14 Therefore purpose in the hearts ˱of˲_you_all not /to_be/_premeditating /to_be/_defended,
\v 15 for I /will_be/_giving /a/_mouth and wisdom ˱to˲_you_all, ˱to˲_which ˱they˲_/will_ not _be/_able /to/_resist or /to/_speak_against all the \add ones\add* opposing ˱to˲_you_all.
\v 16 But ˱you_all˲_/will_be_being/_given_over even by parents, and brothers, and relatives, and friends, and ˱they˲_/will_be/_putting_to_death \add some\add* from you_all.
\v 17 And ˱you_all˲_will_be /being/_hated by all because_of the name ˱of˲_me.
\v 18 But /a/_hair of the head ˱of˲_you_all, by_no_means /may/_=> not <=_perish.
\v 19 By the endurance ˱of˲_you_all, ˱you_all˲_/will_be/_acquiring the lives ˱of˲_you_all.
\v 20 ¶ But whenever ˱you_all˲_/may/_see Jerusalem /being/_surrounded by armies, then know that the desolation ˱of˲_her /has/_neared.
\v 21 Then the \add ones\add* in - Judea, /let_˱them˲_/be_fleeing to the mountains, and the \add ones\add* in midst ˱of˲_her, /let_˱them˲_/be_departing_out, and the \add ones\add* in the countries, ˱them˲_/let_ not _be/_coming_in into her.
\v 22 Because these are days ˱of˲_vengeance - /to_be/_fulfilled all the \add things\add* /having_been/_written.
\v 23 And woe ˱to˲_the \add women\add* having \add child\add* in womb and ˱to˲_the \add women\add* nursing in those - days; for will_be great distress on the land, and wrath - ˱on˲_> this <_people.
\v 24 And ˱they˲_/will_be/_falling ˱by˲_/the/_edge ˱of˲_/the/_sword, and ˱they˲_/will_be_being/_made_captive into all the nations; and Jerusalem will_be /being/_trodden by /the/_pagans, until ˱of˲_which /the/_times ˱of˲_/the/_pagans /may_be/_fulfilled.
\v 25 ¶ And ˱there˲_will_be signs in /the/_sun, and moon, and stars, and anguish ˱of˲_nations on the earth, with perplexity ˱of˲_/the/_sound ˱of˲_/the/_sea and surf,
\v 26 people fainting from fear and expectation ˱of˲_the \add things\add* coming_over ˱to˲_the inhabited_world, for the powers ˱of˲_the heavens /will_be_being/_shaken.
\v 27 And then ˱they˲_/will_be/_seeing ‘the Son - ˱of˲_Man, coming in /a/_cloud’ with power and great glory.
\v 28 But these \add things\add* beginning /to_be/_becoming, straighten_up and lift_up the heads ˱of˲_you_all, because the redemption ˱of˲_you_all /is/_nearing.”
\v 29 ¶ And ˱he˲_said parable ˱to˲_them: “Watch the fig_tree and all the trees;
\v 30 whenever ˱they˲_/may/_put_forward already, seeing \add them\add* for yourselves, ˱you_all˲_/are/_knowing that already the summer is near.
\v 31 Thus also you_all, whenever ˱you_all˲_/may/_see these \add things\add* becoming, ˱it˲_/is_being/_known that the Kingdom - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd* is near.
\v 32 Truly, ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all that by_no_means /may/_=> not <=_pass_away - this generation, until - all \add things\add* /may/_become.
\v 33 The heaven and the earth /will_be/_passing_away, but the words ˱of˲_me by_no_means /will_ not _be/_passing_away.
\v 34 ¶ And /be/_taking_heed ˱to˲_yourselves, lest the hearts ˱of˲_you_all /may_be/_weighed_down with dissipation, and drunkenness, and worries ˱of˲_living, and that sudden - day /may/_approach on you_all
\v 35 as /a/_snare; for ˱it˲_/will_be/_coming_in on all the \add ones\add* sitting on /the/_face ˱of˲_all the earth.
\v 36 /Be/_watching and at every season, beseeching that ˱you_all˲_/may/_prevail /to/_escape all these \add things\add* - going /to_be/_becoming, and /to_be/_stood before the Son - ˱of˲_Man.”
\v 37 ¶ And ˱he˲_was teaching in the temple ˱in˲_the days, but the ˱in˲_/the/_nights coming_out, ˱he˲_/was/_lodging on the mountain - /being/_called ˱of˲_Olives.
\v 38 And all the people /was/_coming_at_dawn to him in the temple /to_be/_hearing ˱from˲_him.
\c 22
\v 1 ¶ And the feast - ˱of˲_Unleavened \add Bread\add*, - /being/_called /the/_Passover ¶ /was/_nearing.
\v 2 And the chief_priests and the scribes /were/_seeking, the \add way\add* how ˱they˲_/may/_kill him, for ˱they˲_/were/_fearing the people.
\v 3 ¶ And Satan came_in into Judas, the \add one\add* /being/_called Iscariot, being of the number ˱of˲_the twelve.
\v 4 And /having/_gone_away, ˱he˲_conversed_with ˱with˲_the chief_priests and officers, the \add way\add* how ˱he˲_/may/_give_ him _over ˱to˲_them.
\v 5 And ˱they˲_/were/_elated and ˱they˲_decided /to/_give ˱to˲_him silver.
\v 6 And ˱he˲_consented, and /was/_seeking opportunity - /to/_give_ him _over ˱to˲_them without /a/_crowd.
\v 7 ¶ And the day - ˱of˲_Unleavened \add Bread\add* came, ˱in˲_which ˱it˲_/was/_fitting the Passover /to_be_being/_sacrificed.
\v 8 And ˱he˲_sent_out Peter and John /having/_said, “/Having_been/_gone, prepare the Passover ˱for˲_us, in_order_that ˱we˲_/may/_eat \add it\add*.”
\v 9 And they said ˱to˲_him, “Where /are/_˱you˲_willing ˱we˲_/may/_prepare?”
\v 10 And he said ˱to˲_them, “Behold, ˱of˲_you_all /having/_come_in into the city, /a/_man, bearing /a/_pitcher ˱of˲_water; /will_be/_meeting ˱with˲_you_all; follow ˱after˲_him into the house into which ˱he˲_/is/_entering_in.
\v 11 And ˱you_all˲_/will_be/_saying ˱to˲_the home_owner ˱of˲_the house, ‘The teacher /is/_saying ˱to˲_you, “Where is the guest_room, where ˱I˲_/may/_eat the Passover with the disciples ˱of˲_me?”’
\v 12 And_that \add one\add* /will_be/_showing ˱to˲_you_all /an/_=> large <=_upper_room, /having_been/_furnished; prepare there.”
\v 13 And /having/_gone_away, ˱they˲_found \add it\add* as ˱he˲_/had/_said ˱to˲_them, and ˱they˲_prepared the Passover.
\v 14 ¶ And when the hour became, ˱he˲_sat_down and the ambassadors with him.
\v 15 And ˱he˲_said to them, “˱With˲_desire ˱I˲_desired /to/_eat this - Passover with you_all, before the \add time\add* ˱for˲_me /to/_suffer.
\v 16 For ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all that by_no_means ˱I˲_/may/_=> not <=_eat it, until ˱of˲_which ˱it˲_/may_be/_fulfilled in the Kingdom - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*.”
\v 17 And /having/_received /the/_cup, /having/_given_thanks ˱he˲_said, “Take this, and divide \add it\add* among themselves.
\v 18 For ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all, by_no_means ˱I˲_/may/_=> not <=_drink of the fruit ˱of˲_the vine from the \add time\add* now, until ˱of˲_which the Kingdom - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd* /may/_come.”
\v 19 And /having/_taken /the/_bread, /having/_given_thanks, ˱he˲_broke and gave \add it\add* ˱to˲_them saying, “This is the body ˱of˲_me, which /being/_given for you_all; /be/_doing this in - my remembrance.”
\v 20 Also the cup likewise after which /to/_dine saying, “This - cup \add is\add* the new covenant in the blood ˱of˲_me, which /being/_poured_out for you_all \add is\add*.
\v 21 However behold, the hand ˱of˲_the \add one\add* giving_over me \add is\add* with me on the table.
\v 22 Because on_one_hand the Son - ˱of˲_Man /is/_going according_to the \add place\add* /having_been/_designated, on_the_other_hand woe - ˱to˲_> that <_man by whom ˱he˲_/is_being/_given_over.”
\v 23 And they began /to_be/_debating to themselves, - who consequently ˱it˲_might_be of them, who going /to_be/_doing this.
\v 24 ¶ And ˱it˲_> also <_became /a/_contention among them, that which ˱of˲_them /is/_supposing to_be /the/_greater.
\v 25 And he said ˱to˲_them, “The kings ˱of˲_the pagans /are/_lording ˱of˲_them, and the \add ones\add* having_authority ˱over˲_them, ‘/are_being/_called benefactors’.
\v 26 But you_all not thus, but the greater among you_all, ˱him˲_/let_be/_becoming as the younger, and the \add one\add* leading, as the \add one\add* serving.
\v 27 For who \add is\add* greater, the \add one\add* reclining or the \add one\add* serving? Not the \add one\add* reclining? But in /the/_midst ˱of˲_you_all I am as the \add one\add* serving.
\v 28 ¶ And you_all are the \add ones\add* /having/_continued with me, in the trials ˱of˲_me.
\v 29 And_I /am/_covenanting ˱to˲_you_all as the Father ˱of˲_me covenanted /a/_kingdom ˱to˲_me,
\v 30 in_order_that ˱you_all˲_/may_be/_eating and ˱you_all˲_/may_be/_drinking at the table ˱of˲_me in the kingdom ˱of˲_me, and ˱you_all˲_/are/_sitting on thrones, judging the twelve tribes - ˱of˲_Israel.
\v 31 ¶ Simon, Simon, behold, - Satan requested /to/_sift you_all - as - wheat;
\v 32 but I /was/_besought for you that the faith ˱of˲_you /may/_=> not <=_fail; and you once /having/_turned_back, strengthen the brothers ˱of˲_you.”
\v 33 And he ˱he˲_said ˱to˲_him, “\nd Lord\nd*, ˱I˲_am ready /to_be/_going with you both to prison and to death.”
\v 34 And he said, “˱I˲_/am/_telling ˱to˲_you, Peter, /the/_rooster /will_ by_no_means _be/_crowing today, until thrice ˱you˲_/will_be/_renouncing /to_have/_known me.”
\v 35 ¶ And ˱he˲_said ˱to˲_them, “When ˱I˲_sent_ you_all _out without purse, and knapsack, and sandals, not ˱you_all˲_lacked ˱of˲_anything?” And they said, “˱Of˲_nothing.”
\v 36 and ˱He˲_said ˱to˲_them, “But now the \add one\add* having /a/_purse /let/_˱him˲_take_up \add it\add*, likewise also /a/_knapsack, and the \add one\add* not having, /a/_sword /let/_˱him˲_sell the coat ˱of˲_him, and /let/_˱him˲_buy.
\v 37 For ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all that this which /having_been/_written, ˱it˲_/is/_fitting /to_be/_accomplished in me, - ‘and ˱he˲_/was/_reckoned with /the/_lawless’; for also the \add thing\add* concerning me /is/_having /an/_end.”
\v 38 And they said, “\nd Lord\nd*, behold, two swords here \add are\add*.” And he said ˱to˲_them, ˱it˲_is “Much.”
\v 39 ¶ And /having/_come_out, ˱he˲_/was/_gone according_to the custom to the Mount - ˱of˲_Olives, and the disciples also followed ˱after˲_him.
\v 40 And /having/_become to the place, ˱he˲_said ˱to˲_them, “/Be/_praying /to/_=> not <=_come_in into temptation.”
\v 41 And he /was/_withdrawn from them about /a/_stone throw, and /having/_knelt the knees, ˱he˲_/was/_praying
\v 42 saying, “Father, if ˱you˲_/are/_wishing, take_away this - cup from me; however not the will ˱of˲_me, but - /let_ your \add will\add* _be/_becoming.”
\v 43
\v 44
\v 45 And /having/_risen_up from the prayer, /having/_come to the disciples, ˱he˲_found them /being/_fallen_asleep from the sorrow,
\v 46 and ˱he˲_said ˱to˲_them, “Why /are/_˱you_all˲_sleeping? /Having/_risen_up /be/_praying that ˱you_all˲_/may/_=> not <=_come_in into temptation.”
\v 47 ¶ Still ˱of˲_him speaking, behold, /a/_crowd and the \add one\add* /being/_called Judas, one ˱of˲_the twelve, /was/_going_ahead them, and ˱he˲_neared - ˱to˲_\nd Jesus\nd* /to/_kiss him.
\v 48 But \nd Jesus\nd* said ˱to˲_him, “Judas, /are/_˱you˲_giving_over the Son - ˱of˲_Man ˱with˲_/a/_kiss?”
\v 49 And the \add ones\add* around him /having/_seen what going_to \add be\add*, ˱they˲_said, “\nd Lord\nd*, - /will_˱we˲_/be_striking with /the/_sword?”
\v 50 And /a/_certain one of them ˱he˲_struck the slave ˱of˲_the chief_priest, and ˱he˲_cut_off the - right ear ˱of˲_him.
\v 51 But - \nd Jesus\nd* answering said, “/Be/_allowing as_far_as this!” And /having/_touched ˱against˲_the ear, ˱he˲_healed him.
\v 52 And \nd Jesus\nd* said to the \add ones\add* /having/_come against him, chief_priests, and officers ˱of˲_the temple, and elders, ˱you_all˲_came_out with swords and clubs “As against /a/_robber?
\v 53 In_every day ˱of˲_me being with you_all in the temple, ˱you_all˲_> not <_stretched_out your hands against me. But this is the hour ˱of˲_you_all, and the power ˱of˲_the darkness.”
\v 54 ¶ And /having/_captured him, ˱they˲_led \add him\add* and brought_in \add him\add* into the house ˱of˲_the chief_priest. But - Peter /was/_following afar.
\v 55 And /having/_kindled /a/_fire in /the/_midst ˱of˲_the courtyard, and /having/_sat_together, - Peter /was/_sitting ˱in˲_/the/_midst ˱of˲_them.
\v 56 And /having/_seen him, /a/_=> certain <=_servant_girl sitting near the light, and /having/_looked_intently ˱at˲_him said, “This \add one\add* was also with him.”
\v 57 But he disowned \add him\add* saying, “˱I˲_/have/_=> not <=_known him, woman.”
\v 58 And after /a/_little, another /having/_seen him /was/_saying, “You are also of them.” But - Peter /was/_saying, “Man, ˱I˲_am not.”
\v 59 And one hour /having/_passed_by about, /a/_certain other /was/_insisting saying, “In truth also this \add one\add* was with him, for ˱he˲_is also /a/_Galilean.”
\v 60 But - Peter said, “Man, ˱I˲_/have/_=> not <=_known what ˱you˲_/are/_saying.” And immediately ˱of˲_him still speaking, /the/_rooster crowed.
\v 61 And the \nd Lord\nd* /having_been/_turned, focused_in - ˱on˲_Peter, and - Peter /was/_reminded ˱of˲_the word ˱of˲_the \nd Lord\nd*, how ˱he˲_said ˱to˲_him, - “before /the/_rooster /to/_crow today, ˱you˲_/will_be/_renouncing me thrice.”
\v 62 And /having/_come_out outside, ˱he˲_wept bitterly.
\v 63 ¶ And the men - holding him, /were/_mocking ˱at˲_him beating.
\v 64 And /having/_blindfolded him, ˱they˲_/were/_asking saying, “Prophesy, who is the \add one\add* /having/_struck you?”
\v 65 And ˱they˲_/were/_saying many other \add things\add* slandering, to him.
\v 66 ¶ And when ˱it˲_became day, the council_of_elders ˱of˲_the people, both chief_priests and scribes /was/_gathered_together, and ˱they˲_led_away him into the Sanhedrin ˱of˲_them
\v 67 saying, “If you are the \nd Messiah\nd*, tell ˱to˲_us.” But ˱he˲_said ˱to˲_them, “If ˱I˲_/may/_tell ˱to˲_you_all, by_no_means ˱you_all˲_/may/_=> not <=_believe;
\v 68 and if ˱I˲_/may/_ask, by_no_means ˱you_all˲_/may/_=> not <=_answer.
\v 69 And from the \add time\add* now the Son - ˱of˲_Man will_be ‘sitting on /the/_right \add hand\add*’ ˱of˲_the power - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*.”
\v 70 and said all, “Therefore are you the Son - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*?” And he /was/_saying to them, “You_all /are/_saying that I am.”
\v 71 And they said, “What /are/_˱we˲_having need ˱of˲_testimony anymore? For we ˱we˲_heard \add it\add* from the mouth ˱of˲_him.”
\c 23
\v 1 ¶ And all the multitude ˱of˲_them /having/_risen_up, ˱they˲_led him to - Pilate.
\v 2 And ˱they˲_began /to_be/_accusing ˱against˲_him saying, “˱We˲_found this \add man\add* perverting the nation ˱of˲_us, and forbidding /to_be/_giving taxes ˱to˲_Caesar, and saying himself /the/_\nd Messiah\nd*, /a/_king to_be.”
\v 3 And - Pilate asked him saying, “Are you the king ˱of˲_the Jews?” And he answering ˱to˲_him ˱he˲_/was/_saying, “You /are/_saying \add it\add*.”
\v 4 And - Pilate said to the chief_priests and the crowds, “˱I˲_/am/_finding not_one guilty in - this man.”
\v 5 But they /were/_insisting saying, - “˱He˲_/is/_stirring_up the people, teaching throughout all the Judea, /having/_begun from - Galilee as_far_as here.”
\v 6 ¶ And Pilate /having/_heard, ˱he˲_asked whether the man is /a/_Galilean.
\v 7 And /having/_known that ˱he˲_is from the domain ˱of˲_Herod, ˱he˲_sent_ him _up to - Herod, himself being also at Jerusalem in these - days.
\v 8 And - Herod /having/_seen - \nd Jesus\nd*, /was/_elated exceedingly, for ˱he˲_was of much times wanting /to/_see him, because_of the \add thing\add* /to_be/_hearing concerning him, and ˱he˲_/was/_hoping /to/_see /a/_certain sign becoming by him.
\v 9 And ˱he˲_/was/_asking him in many words, but he ˱he˲_answered nothing ˱to˲_him.
\v 10 And the chief_priests and the scribes /had/_stood vigorously accusing ˱against˲_him.
\v 11 And - Herod with the armies ˱of˲_him /having/_=> also <=_scorned him, and /having/_mocked \add him\add* /having/_thrown_ splendid clothing _around \add him\add*, ˱he˲_sent_up him - ˱to˲_Pilate.
\v 12 And on same - day - both Herod and - Pilate became friends with one_another; for ˱they˲_/were/_previously_starting being at enmity with themselves.
\v 13 ¶ And Pilate /having/_called_together the chief_priests, and the rulers, and the people,
\v 14 said to them, “˱You_all˲_brought this - man ˱to˲_me, as turning_away the people, but behold, I /having/_examined \add him\add* before you_all, ˱I˲_found nothing in - this man guilty ˱of˲_which ˱you_all˲_/are/_accusing against him.
\v 15 But not_even Herod \add did\add*, for ˱he˲_sent_ him _up. to us. And behold, nothing worthy ˱of˲_death is /having_been/_done ˱by˲_him.
\v 16 Therefore /having/_disciplined him, ˱I˲_/will_be/_sending_away \add him\add*.”
\v 17
\v 18 But ˱they˲_cried_out all_together saying, “/Be/_taking_away this \add man\add*, and send_ - Barabbas _away ˱to˲_us!”
\v 19 Who was, /having_been/_cast in the prison because_of /a/_certain insurrection /having/_become in the city and murder.
\v 20 And again - Pilate called_out ˱to˲_them, wanting /to/_send_ - \nd Jesus\nd* _away.
\v 21 But they /were/_crying_out saying, “/Be/_crucifying, /be/_crucifying him.”
\v 22 And thirdly he said to them, “For what evil did this \add man\add*? ˱I˲_found not_one cause ˱of˲_death in him. Therefore /having/_disciplined him, ˱I˲_/will_be/_sending_away \add him\add*.”
\v 23 And they /were/_imposing ˱with˲_> loud <_voices, requesting him /to_be/_crucified, and the voices ˱of˲_them. /were/_prevailing.
\v 24 And Pilate sentenced the request ˱of˲_them /to/_become.
\v 25 And sent_away the \add one\add* /having_been/_cast into - because_of insurrection and murder prison, whom ˱they˲_/were/_requesting, but - ˱he˲_gave_ \nd Jesus\nd* _over ˱to˲_the will ˱of˲_them.
\v 26 ¶ And as ˱they˲_led_away him, /having/_taken_hold_of Simon, /a/_certain Cyrenian coming from /the/_country, ˱they˲_put_ the cross _on ˱to˲_him, /to_be/_carrying behind - \nd Jesus\nd*.
\v 27 And /a/_great multitude ˱of˲_the people /was/_following ˱with˲_him, and ˱of˲_women who /were/_mourning and /were/_lamenting him.
\v 28 But \nd Jesus\nd* /having_been/_turned to them, said, “Daughters ˱of˲_Jerusalem, /be/_=> not <=_weeping for me, however /be/_weeping for yourselves, and for the children ˱of˲_you_all.
\v 29 Because behold, days /are/_coming in which ˱they˲_/will_be/_saying, ‘Blessed \add are\add* the barren, and wombs that not bore, and breasts that not nursed.’
\v 30 Then ‘˱they˲_/will_be/_beginning /to_be/_saying ˱to˲_the mountains, “Fall on us”, and ˱to˲_the hills, “Cover us”.’
\v 31 Because if ˱they˲_/are/_doing these \add things\add* in the green tree, what /may/_become in the dry?”
\v 32 ¶ And two other criminals /were_ also _being/_led with him /to_be/_killed.
\v 33 And when ˱they˲_came to the place - /being/_called /the/_Skull, there ˱they˲_crucified him and the criminals, one on_one_hand on /the/_right, one on_the_other_hand on /the/_left.
\v 34 But dividing the clothes ˱of˲_him, ˱they˲_cast /a/_lot.
\v 35 And the people observing /had/_stood. and the rulers ˱they˲_/were/_sneering_at \add him\add* also saying, ˱he˲_saved others, /let/_˱him˲_save himself, if this is the \nd Messiah\nd*, the son - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*, the chosen \add one\add*.”
\v 36 And the soldiers ˱they˲_mocked ˱at˲_him also approaching, offering wine_vinegar ˱to˲_him,
\v 37 and saying, “If you are the King ˱of˲_the Jews, save yourself!”
\v 38 And was also /an/_inscription over him: “the King ˱of˲_the Jews this \add is\add*.”
\v 39 ¶ And one ˱of˲_the criminals /having_been/_hanged /was/_slandering him saying, “Are you not the \nd Messiah\nd*? Save yourself and us!”
\v 40 But the other \add one\add* answering giving_rebuke ˱to˲_him /was/_saying, “Not_even /are/_=> you <=_fearing - \nd God\nd*, that ˱you˲_are in the same judgment?
\v 41 And we on_one_hand justly, for ˱we˲_/are/_taking_back worthy \add things\add* ˱of˲_what ˱we˲_did; on_the_other_hand this \add one\add* did not_one amiss.”
\v 42 And ˱he˲_/was/_saying, “\nd Jesus\nd*, /Be/_reminded ˱of˲_me, whenever ˱you˲_/may/_come in the kingdom ˱of˲_you!”
\v 43 And ˱he˲_said ˱to˲_him, “Truly, ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you, today ˱you˲_will_be with me in - Paradise.”
\v 44 ¶ And ˱it˲_was now about /the/_=> sixth <=_hour, and darkness became over all the land until /the/_=> ninth <=_hour.
\v 45 ˱Of˲_the sun /having/_darkened, and the curtain ˱of˲_the temple /was/_torn ˱in˲_/the/_middle.
\v 46 And - \nd Jesus\nd* /having/_called ˱with˲_/a/_=> loud <=_voice, said, “Father, ‘˱I˲_/am/_entrusting the \nd Spirit\nd* ˱of˲_me into /the/_hands ˱of˲_you’.” And /having/_said this, ˱he˲_expired.
\v 47 And the centurion /having/_seen the \add thing\add* /having/_become, ˱he˲_glorified - \nd God\nd* saying, “Really - this man was righteous.”
\v 48 And all the crowds /having/_come_together, to - spectacle this, /having/_observed the \add things\add* /having/_become, /were/_returning striking the chests.
\v 49 And all the acquaintances ˱to˲_him /had/_stood from afar, and the /the/_women who accompanying ˱with˲_him from - Galilee, seeing these \add things\add*.
\v 50 ¶ And behold, /a/_man ˱by˲_/the/_name Joseph, being /a/_Council_member, and /a/_=> good <=_man and righteous
\v 51 (this \add one\add* was not /having/_consented_with ˱with˲_the counsel and the practice ˱of˲_them), from Arimathea, /a/_city ˱of˲_the Jews, who /was/_waiting_for the Kingdom - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*.
\v 52 He /having/_approached - ˱to˲_Pilate, requested the body - ˱of˲_\nd Jesus\nd*.
\v 53 And /having/_taken_down \add it\add*, ˱he˲_wrapped it ˱in˲_/a/_linen_cloth and put him in /a/_=> rock_cut <=_tomb, where not_yet no_one was not lying.
\v 54 And ˱it˲_was /the/_day ˱of˲_Preparation, and /the/_Sabbath /was/_dawning.
\v 55 And the women /having/_followed, who were /having/_come_together from - Galilee ˱with˲_him, saw the tomb and how the body ˱of˲_him /was/_laid.
\v 56 And /having/_returned, ˱they˲_prepared spices and ointments. ¶ And indeed ˱on˲_the Sabbath ˱they˲_rested according_to the commandment.
\c 24
\v 1 But ˱on˲_the first \add day\add* ˱of˲_the week, early dawn, ˱they˲_came to the tomb, bringing spices which ˱they˲_prepared.
\v 2 And ˱they˲_found the stone /having_been/_rolled_away from the tomb.
\v 3 But /having/_come_in, ˱they˲_> not <_found the body ˱of˲_the \nd Lord\nd* \nd Jesus\nd*.
\v 4 And ˱it˲_became at the \add time\add* them /to_be/_perplexing about this, and behold, two men approached ˱to˲_them in flashing clothing.
\v 5 And them /having/_become frightened, and bowing their faces to the ground, ˱they˲_said to them, “Why /are/_˱you_all˲_seeking the_> living <_\add one\add* with the dead?
\v 6 ˱He˲_is not here, but ˱he˲_/was/_raised! /Be/_reminded how ˱he˲_spoke ˱to˲_you_all, still being in - Galilee
\v 7 saying, ‘The Son - ˱of˲_Man - ˱it˲_/is/_fitting /to_be/_given_over into hands ˱of˲_> sinful <_people, and /to_be/_crucified, and ˱on˲_the third day /to/_rise_up.’”
\v 8 And ˱they˲_/were/_reminded ˱of˲_the words ˱of˲_him.
\v 9 And /having/_returned from the tomb, ˱they˲_reported all these \add things\add* ˱to˲_the eleven, and ˱to˲_all the rest.
\v 10 And ˱they˲_were the Magdalene Mary, and Joanna, and Mary the \add mother\add* ˱of˲_Jacobus, and the rest with them, ˱who˲_/were/_telling these \add things\add* to the ambassadors.
\v 11 And - these words /were/_seen before them as_if nonsense, and ˱they˲_/were/_disbelieving ˱to˲_them.
\v 12 But - Peter /having/_risen_up, ran to the tomb, and /having/_stooped_down, /is/_seeing only the linen_cloths, and ˱he˲_went_away to himself, wondering ˱at˲_the \add thing\add* /having/_become.
\v 13 ¶ And behold, two of them at same the day were going to /a/_village being_ sixty stadiums _away from Jerusalem, ˱to˲_whose name \add is\add* Emmaus.
\v 14 And they /were/_conversing with one_another about all these \add things\add* - /having/_happened.
\v 15 And ˱it˲_became at the \add time\add*, them /to_be/_conversing and /to_be/_debating, and \nd Jesus\nd* himself /having/_neared, /was/_going_with ˱with˲_them.
\v 16 But the eyes ˱of˲_them /were_being/_restrained - /to/_=> not <=_know him.
\v 17 And ˱he˲_said to them, “What_all \add are\add* - these words that ˱you_all˲_/are/_exchanging with one_another walking?” And ˱they˲_/were/_stood \add still\add* downcast.
\v 18 And /the/_one ˱by˲_/the/_name Cleopas answering said to him, /are/_=> “you only <=_sojourning ˱to˲_Jerusalem and ˱you˲_> not <_knew the \add things\add* /having/_become in it in - these days?”
\v 19 And ˱he˲_said ˱to˲_them, “What \add things\add*?” And they said ˱to˲_him, “The \add things\add* concerning \nd Jesus\nd* - Nazarean, who became /a/_man, /a/_prophet, powerful in work and word, before - \nd God\nd* and all the people,
\v 20 and so_that the chief_priests and the rulers ˱of˲_us gave_ him _over, to judgment ˱of˲_death, and ˱they˲_crucified him.
\v 21 But we /were/_hoping that he is the \add one\add* going /to_be/_redeeming - Israel. But surely also with all these \add things\add*, ˱it˲_/is/_coming this third day, from which these \add things\add* became.
\v 22 But also some women from us, amazed us, /having/_become early to the tomb
\v 23 and not /having/_found the body ˱of˲_him, came saying also /to_have/_seen /a/_vision ˱of˲_angels, who /are/_saying him /to_be/_living.
\v 24 And some ˱of˲_the \add ones\add* with us went_away to the tomb, and ˱they˲_found \add it\add* thus, as the women said, but ˱they˲_> not <_saw him.”
\v 25 And he said to them, “O foolish and slow - ˱in˲_heart, - /to_be/_believing in all \add things\add* that the prophets spoke.
\v 26 Not /was/_˱it˲_fitting the \nd Messiah\nd* /to/_suffer these \add things\add* and /to/_come_in into the glory ˱of˲_him?”
\v 27 And /having/_begun from Moses and from all the prophets, ˱he˲_interpreted all the Scriptures ˱to˲_them in the \add things\add* concerning himself.
\v 28 ¶ And ˱they˲_neared to the village where ˱they˲_/were/_going, and he seemed /to_be/_going farther_away.
\v 29 And ˱they˲_urged him saying, “Remain with us, because ˱it˲_is toward evening, and the day /has/_=> now <=_declined.” And ˱he˲_came_in - /to/_remain with them.
\v 30 And ˱it˲_became at the \add time\add* him /to_be/_reclining with them, /having/_taken the bread, ˱he˲_blessed \add it\add* and /having/_broke \add it\add*, /was/_handing_out \add it\add* ˱to˲_them.
\v 31 And the eyes them /were/_opened_up, and ˱they˲_recognized him. And he became vanished from them.
\v 32 And ˱they˲_said to one_another, “Not the heart ˱of˲_us /being/_burned was as ˱he˲_/was/_speaking ˱with˲_us on the road, as ˱he˲_/was/_opening_up the Scriptures ˱to˲_us?”
\v 33 And /having/_risen_up ˱to˲_/the/_same - hour, ˱they˲_returned to Jerusalem, and ˱they˲_found the eleven and the \add ones\add* with them /having_been/_gathered
\v 34 saying, - “The \nd Lord\nd* really /was/_raised, and /was/_seen ˱to˲_Simon.”
\v 35 And they /were/_explaining the \add things\add* on the road, and how ˱he˲_/was/_known ˱to˲_them in the breaking ˱of˲_the bread.
\v 36 ¶ And ˱of˲_them speaking these \add things\add*, himself stood in midst ˱of˲_them and /is/_saying ˱to˲_them, “Peace ˱to˲_you_all.”
\v 37 but /having_been/_alarmed and /having/_become frightened, ˱they˲_/were/_supposing /to_be/_observing /a/_spirit.
\v 38 And ˱he˲_said ˱to˲_them, “Why are_˱you_all˲ /having_been/_disturbed, and why /are/_=> speculations <=_going_up in the heart ˱of˲_you_all?
\v 39 See the hands ˱of˲_me and the feet ˱of˲_me that I am he. Touch me and see, because /a/_spirit /is/_=> not <=_having fleshes and bones, as ˱you_all˲_/are/_observing me having.”
\v 40 And /having/_said this, ˱he˲_showed his hands and his feet ˱to˲_them.
\v 41 And still ˱of˲_them disbelieving for the joy and wondering, ˱he˲_said ˱to˲_them, “˱You_all˲_/are/_having any edible \add thing\add* here?”
\v 42 And they handed_out ˱to˲_him part ˱of˲_/a/_=> broiled <=_fish.
\v 43 And /having/_taken \add it\add*, ˱he˲_ate before ˱of˲_them.
\v 44 ¶ And ˱he˲_said to them, “These \add are\add* the words ˱of˲_me, which ˱I˲_spoke to you_all still being with you_all, that ˱it˲_/is/_fitting /to_be/_fulfilled all the \add things\add* /having_been/_written in the law ˱of˲_Moses, and the prophets, and psalms, concerning me.”
\v 45 Then ˱he˲_opened_up the mind ˱of˲_them - /to_be/_understanding the Scriptures. And ˱he˲_said ˱to˲_them,
\v 46 - “Thus ˱it˲_/has_been/_written, the \nd Messiah\nd* /to/_suffer, and /to/_rise_up from /the/_dead ˱on˲_the third day,
\v 47 and the name ˱of˲_him /to_be/_proclaimed in repentance for forgiveness ˱of˲_sins to all the nations, /having/_begun from Jerusalem.
\v 48 You_all \add are\add* witnesses ˱of˲_these \add things\add*.
\v 49 And behold I /am/_sending_out the promise ˱of˲_the Father ˱of˲_me on you_all; but you_all sit_down in the city, until ˱of˲_which ˱you_all˲_/may/_dress_in power from ˱of˲_height.”
\v 50 ¶ And ˱he˲_led_ them _out as_far_as to Bethany, and /having/_lifted_up the hands ˱of˲_him, ˱he˲_blessed them.
\v 51 And ˱it˲_became at the \add time\add* ˱of˲_him /to_be/_blessing ˱to˲_them, ˱he˲_passed_by from them, and ˱he˲_/was_being/_brought_up into the sky.
\v 52 And they /having/_worshipped him, returned to Jerusalem with great joy.
\v 53 And ˱they˲_were in the temple blessing - \nd God\nd* through all.
