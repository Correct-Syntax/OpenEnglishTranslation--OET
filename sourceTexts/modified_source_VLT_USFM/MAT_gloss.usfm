\v 6 And Jesse bore - David the king. ¶ And David bore - Solomon of the \add wife\add* - ˱of˲_Uriah,
\v 7 And Solomon bore - Rehoboam, And Rehoboam bore - Abijah, And Abijah bore - Asaph,

\v 11 And Josiah bore - Jechonias and the brothers ˱of˲_him during the deportation ˱to˲_Babylon.
\v 12 ¶ And after the deportation ˱to˲_Babylon, Jechonias bore - Salathiel, And Salathiel bore - Zorobabel,
\v 13 And Zorobabel bore - Abiud, And Abiud bore - Eliakim, And Eliakim bore - Azor,

\v 16 And Jacob bore - Joseph the husband ˱of˲_Mary, of whom /was/_born \nd Jesus\nd*, the \add one\add* /being/_called /the/_\nd Anointed|Christ\nd*.
\v 17 ¶ Therefore all the generations from Abraham to David \add were\add* fourteen generations, and from David until the deportation ˱to˲_Babylon fourteen generations, and from the deportation ˱to˲_Babylon to the \nd Messiah\nd* fourteen generations.
\v 18 ¶ And the birth - ˱of˲_\nd Jesus\nd* \nd Christ\nd* was thus: the mother ˱of˲_him Mary /having_been/_betrothed - ˱to˲_Joseph, before - them /to/_come_together, ˱she˲_/was/_found having in womb by /the/_=> Holy <=_\nd Spirit\nd*.
\v 19 And Joseph the husband ˱of˲_her, being righteous and not willing /to/_expose her, /was/_counseled /to/_send_ her _away secretly.
\v 20 But these \add things\add* /having_been/_considered ˱of˲_him, behold, /an/_angel ˱of˲_/the/_\nd Lord\nd* /was/_seen ˱to˲_him in /a/_dream saying, “Joseph, son ˱of˲_David, /may_ not _be/_afraid /to/_receive Mary the wife ˱of˲_you, for the \add one\add* in her /having_been/_born is from /the/_=> Holy <=_\nd Spirit\nd*.
\v 21 And ˱she˲_/will_be/_bearing /a/_son, and ˱you˲_/will_be/_calling the name ˱of˲_him \nd Jesus\nd*, for he /will_be/_saving the people ˱of˲_him from the sins ˱of˲_them.”
\v 22 And all this /has/_become, in_order_that the \add thing\add* /having_been/_spoken by /the/_\nd Lord\nd* through the prophet /may_be/_fulfilled saying,
\v 23 “behold, the virgin /will_be/_having in womb and /will_be/_bearing /a/_son, and ˱they˲_/will_be/_calling the name ˱of˲_him Emmanuel”, which is /being/_translated, “- \nd God\nd* with us”.
\v 24 And - Joseph /having_been/_raised from the sleep, did as the angel ˱of˲_/the/_\nd Lord\nd* commanded ˱to˲_him, and received the wife ˱of˲_him,
\v 25 and /was/_=> not <=_knowing her until ˱of˲_which ˱she˲_bore /a/_son; and ˱he˲_called the name ˱of˲_him, \nd Jesus\nd*.
\c 2
\v 1 ¶ And - \nd Jesus\nd* /having_been/_born in Bethlehem - ˱of˲_Judea in /the/_days ˱of˲_Herod the king, behold, magi from east arrived in Jerusalem
\v 2 saying, “Where is the \add one\add*, /having_been/_born King ˱of˲_the Jews? For ˱we˲_saw the star ˱of˲_him in the east and ˱we˲_came /to/_worship ˱before˲_him.”
\v 3 And - king Herod /having/_heard /was/_disturbed, and all Jerusalem with him.
\v 4 And /having/_gathered_together all the chief_priests and scribes ˱of˲_the people, ˱he˲_/was/_inquiring from them where the \nd Messiah\nd* /is_being/_born.
\v 5 And they said ˱to˲_him, “In Bethlehem - ˱of˲_Judea”; for thus ˱it˲_/has_been/_written through the prophet:
\v 6 “and you Bethlehem, land ˱of˲_Judah, are by_no_means least among the rulers ˱of˲_Judah; for out_of ˱of˲_you /will_be/_coming_out /a/_leading \add one\add*, who /will_be/_shepherding the people ˱of˲_me - Israel.”
\v 7 ¶ Then Herod /having/_=> secretly <=_called the magi, ascertained from them the time ˱of˲_the appearing star.
\v 8 And /having/_sent them to Bethlehem ˱he˲_said, “/Having_been/_gone, search_out exactly for the little_child; and when ˱you_all˲_/may/_find \add him\add*, report ˱to˲_me so_that also_I /having/_come /may/_worship ˱before˲_him.”
\v 9 And - /having/_heard ˱from˲_the king, ˱they˲_/were/_gone, and behold, the star, which ˱they˲_saw in the east, /was/_going_before them until /having/_come ˱it˲_/was/_stood over where the little_child was.
\v 10 And /having/_seen the star, ˱they˲_/were/_elated ˱with˲_> great <_joy exceedingly.
\v 11 And /having/_come into the house, ˱they˲_saw the little_child with Mary the mother ˱of˲_him, and /having/_fallen ˱they˲_worshipped ˱before˲_him, and /having/_opened_up the treasures ˱of˲_them, ˱they˲_offered gifts ˱to˲_him: gold, and frankincense, and myrrh.
\v 12 And /having_been/_warned in /a/_dream not /to/_return to Herod, ˱they˲_withdrew by another way into the country ˱of˲_them.
\v 13 ¶ And /having/_withdrawn ˱from˲_them, behold, /an/_angel ˱of˲_/the/_\nd Lord\nd* /is/_appearing in /a/_dream - ˱to˲_Joseph saying, “/Having_been/_raised, take the little_child and the mother ˱of˲_him and /be/_fleeing into Egypt, and be there until - ˱I˲_/may/_tell ˱to˲_you; for Herod /is/_going /to_be/_seeking the little_child, - /to/_destroy him.”
\v 14 And - /having_been/_raised, ˱he˲_took the little_child and the mother ˱of˲_him ˱by˲_night and withdrew into Egypt,
\v 15 and ˱he˲_was there until the death ˱of˲_Herod, in_order_that /may_be/_fulfilled the \add word\add* /having_been/_spoken by /the/_\nd Lord\nd* through the prophet saying, “out_of ˱of˲_Egypt ˱I˲_called the Son ˱of˲_me.”
\v 16 ¶ Then Herod, /having/_seen that ˱he˲_/was/_mocked by the magi, /was/_enraged exceedingly and /having/_sent_out, ˱he˲_killed all the boys - in Bethlehem and in all the regions ˱of˲_it from two_year and lower, according_to the time which ˱he˲_ascertained from the magi.
\v 17 Then the \add word\add* /was/_fulfilled /having_been/_spoken through Jeremiah the prophet saying,
\v 18 “/a/_voice in Rama /was/_heard, weeping and great mourning, Rachel weeping ˱for˲_the children ˱of˲_her, and /was/_=> not <=_wanting /to_be/_comforted, because ˱they˲_are not.”
\v 19 ¶ But - Herod /having/_died, behold, /an/_angel ˱of˲_/the/_\nd Lord\nd* /is/_appearing in /a/_dream - ˱to˲_Joseph in Egypt
\v 20 saying, “/Having_been/_raised, take the little_child and the mother ˱of˲_him, and /be/_going into /the/_land ˱of˲_Israel, for the \add ones\add* seeking the life ˱of˲_the little_child /have/_died.”
\v 21 And - /having_been/_raised, ˱he˲_took the little_child and the mother ˱of˲_him, and came_in into /the/_land ˱of˲_Israel.
\v 22 But /having/_heard that Archelaus /is/_reigning - ˱over˲_Judea instead_of the father ˱of˲_him Herod, ˱he˲_/was/_afraid /to/_go_away there; and /having_been/_warned in /a/_dream, ˱he˲_withdrew into the districts - ˱of˲_Galilee,
\v 23 and /having/_come, ˱he˲_dwelt into /a/_city /being/_called Nazareth, so_that the \add word\add* /may_be/_fulfilled /having_been/_spoken through the prophets, ˱he˲_/will_be_being/_called - “/a/_Nazarene.”
\c 3
\v 1 ¶ And in - those days John the Baptist /is/_arriving, proclaiming in the desert - ˱of˲_Judea
\v 2 saying, “/Be/_repenting, for the Kingdom ˱of˲_the Heavens /has/_neared.”
\v 3 For this is the \add one\add* /having_been/_spoken through Isaiah the prophet saying, “/the/_voice ˱of˲_/a/_shouting \add one\add* in the desert: ‘Prepare the way ˱of˲_/the/_\nd Lord\nd*, /be/_making the paths ˱of˲_him straight.’”
\v 4 And - John himself /was/_having the clothing ˱of˲_him from hairs ˱of˲_/a/_camel and /a/_=> leather <=_belt around the waist ˱of˲_him, and the food ˱of˲_him was locusts and wild honey.
\v 5 Then Jerusalem, and all - Judea, and all the surrounding_region ˱of˲_the Jordan /was/_going_out to him,
\v 6 and ˱they˲_/were_being/_baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing the sins ˱of˲_them.
\v 7 ¶ But /having/_seen many ˱of˲_the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to the baptism ˱of˲_him, ˱he˲_said ˱to˲_them, “Brood ˱of˲_vipers, who warned ˱to˲_you_all /to/_flee from the coming wrath?
\v 8 Therefore produce fruit worthy - ˱of˲_repentance.
\v 9 And ˱you_all˲_/may/_=> not <=_suppose /to_be/_saying among yourselves, ˱we˲_/are/_having - Abraham father, for ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all that - \nd God\nd* /is/_able these children - /to/_Abraham out_of the stones /to/_raise.
\v 10 And already the axe /is/_lying to the root ˱of˲_the trees; therefore every tree not producing good fruit /is_being/_cut_off and /is_being/_cast into /the/_fire.
\v 11 I on_one_hand /am/_baptizing you_all with water to repentance, on_the_other_hand the \add one\add* coming after me is mightier \add than\add* me, ˱of˲_whom not ˱I˲_am worthy /to/_bear the sandals. He /will_be/_baptizing you_all with /the/_=> Holy <=_\nd Spirit\nd* and ˱with˲_fire.
\v 12 ˱Of˲_whom the winnowing_fork \add is\add* in the hand ˱of˲_him, and ˱he˲_/will_be/_clearing_out the threshing_floor ˱of˲_him, and /will_be/_gathering_together the wheat ˱of˲_him into the barn, ˱of˲_him, but the chaff ˱he˲_/will_be/_burning_up ˱with˲_> inextinguishable <_fire.”
\v 13 ¶ Then - \nd Jesus\nd* /is/_arriving from - Galilee to the Jordan to - John, - /to_be/_baptized by him.
\v 14 But - /was/_forbidding him saying, “I /am/_having need /to_be/_baptized by you, and you /are/_coming to me?”
\v 15 But - \nd Jesus\nd* answering said to him, “Allow \add it\add* now, for thus ˱it˲_is befitting ˱to˲_us /to/_fulfill all righteousness.” Then ˱he˲_/is/_allowing him.
\v 16 And /having_been/_baptized, - \nd Jesus\nd* immediately went_up from the water; and behold, the heavens /were/_opened_up, and ˱he˲_saw the \nd Spirit\nd* - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd* coming_down as /a/_dove and coming on him.
\v 17 And behold, /a/_voice out_of ˱of˲_the heavens saying, “This is the Son ˱of˲_me, the beloved in whom ˱I˲_took_pleasure.”
\c 4
\v 1 ¶ Then - \nd Jesus\nd* /was/_brought_up into the desert by the \nd Spirit\nd* /to_be/_tempted by the devil.
\v 2 And /having/_fasted forty days and forty nights, later ˱he˲_hungered.
\v 3 And the \add one\add* tempting /having/_approached, said ˱to˲_him, “If ˱you˲_are /the/_Son - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*, speak that the these stones /may/_become loaves.”
\v 4 But he answering said, “˱It˲_/has_been/_written, ‘the person not only by bread /will_be/_living, but by every word going_out through /the/_mouth ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*.’”
\v 5 ¶ Then the devil /is/_taking him to the holy city, and stood him on the pinnacle ˱of˲_the temple,
\v 6 and ˱he˲_/is/_saying ˱to˲_him, “If ˱you˲_are /the/_Son - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*, cast yourself down; for ˱it˲_/has_been/_written, - ‘/will_be/_commanding ˱to˲_the angels ˱of˲_him concerning you’, and, ‘˱they˲_/will_be/_carrying you in /their/_hands, lest ˱you˲_/may/_strike the foot ˱of˲_you against /a/_stone.’”
\v 7 - \nd Jesus\nd* /was/_saying ˱to˲_him, “Again ˱it˲_/has_been/_written, ‘˱you˲_/will_ not _be/_testing /the/_\nd Lord\nd* the \nd God\nd* ˱of˲_you.’”
\v 8 ¶ Again the devil /is/_taking him to /a/_=> high <=_mountain exceedingly, and /is/_showing ˱to˲_him all the kingdoms ˱of˲_the world and the glory ˱of˲_them,
\v 9 and ˱he˲_said ˱to˲_him, all these \add things\add* ˱to˲_you “˱I˲_/will_be/_giving, if /having/_fallen ˱you˲_/may/_worship ˱before˲_me.”
\v 10 Then - \nd Jesus\nd* /is/_saying ˱to˲_him, “/Be/_going_away, Satan; for ˱it˲_/has_been/_written, ‘˱you˲_/will_be/_worshipping /the/_\nd Lord\nd* the \nd God\nd* ˱of˲_you, and only ˱unto˲_him ˱you˲_/will_be/_serving.’”
\v 11 Then the devil /is/_leaving him, and behold, angels approached and /were/_serving ˱unto˲_him.
\v 12 ¶ And /having/_heard that John /was/_given_over, ˱he˲_withdrew into - Galilee.
\v 13 And /having/_left - Nazareth, /having/_come ˱he˲_dwelt at Capernaum, which \add is\add* ˱by˲_/the/_seaside in /the/_regions ˱of˲_Zabulon and Nephthalim;
\v 14 in_order_that the \add word\add* /may_be/_fulfilled /having_been/_spoken by Isaiah the prophet saying,
\v 15 “land ˱of˲_Zabulon and land ˱of˲_Nephthalim, way ˱of˲_/the/_sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee ˱of˲_the pagans.
\v 16 The people - sitting in darkness saw /a/_=> great <=_light, and ˱to˲_the \add ones\add* sitting in /a/_land and shadow ˱of˲_death, /a/_light rose ˱on˲_them.”
\v 17 from then - \nd Jesus\nd* began /to_be/_proclaiming and /to_be/_saying, “/Be/_repenting, for the Kingdom ˱of˲_the Heavens /has/_neared.”
\v 18 ¶ And walking beside the sea - Two ˱he˲_saw, ˱of˲_Galilee brothers, Simon - /being/_called Peter and Andrew the brother ˱of˲_him, casting /a/_casting_net into the sea, for ˱they˲_were fishermen.
\v 19 And ˱he˲_/is/_saying ˱to˲_them, “Come after me, and ˱I˲_/will_be/_making you_all fishermen ˱of˲_people.”
\v 20 And - immediately /having/_left the nets, ˱they˲_followed ˱after˲_him.
\v 21 And /having/_advanced from_there, ˱he˲_saw two other brothers, Jacobus the \add son\add* - ˱of˲_Zebedee and John the brother ˱of˲_him, in the boat with Zebedee the father ˱of˲_them, preparing the nets ˱of˲_them, and ˱he˲_called them.
\v 22 And - immediately /having/_left the boat and the father ˱of˲_them, ˱they˲_followed ˱after˲_him.
\v 23 ¶ And the \nd Jesus\nd* ˱he˲_/was/_going_around in all - Galilee, teaching in the synagogues ˱of˲_them, and proclaiming the gospel ˱of˲_the kingdom, and healing every disease and every sickness among the people.
\v 24 And the report ˱of˲_him went_away into all - Syria. And ˱they˲_brought ˱to˲_him all the \add ones\add* sickly, having ˱with˲_various diseases, and /being/_gripped_with ˱with˲_torments, being_demon_possessed, and being_epileptic, and paralytic, and ˱he˲_healed them.
\v 25 And great crowds followed ˱after˲_him from - Galilee, and /the/_Decapolis, and Jerusalem, and Judea, and beyond the Jordan.
\c 5
\v 1 ¶ And /having/_seen the crowds, ˱he˲_went_up on the mountain; and him /having/_sat_down, the disciples ˱of˲_him approached ˱to˲_him.
\v 2 And /having/_opened_up the mouth ˱of˲_him, ˱he˲_/was/_teaching them saying,
\v 3 “Blessed \add are\add* the poor ˱in˲_the spirit, because ˱to˲_them is the Kingdom ˱of˲_the Heavens.
\v 4 Blessed \add are\add* the \add ones\add* mourning, because they /will_be_being/_comforted.
\v 5 Blessed \add are\add* the gentle, because they /will_be/_inheriting the earth.
\v 6 Blessed \add are\add* the \add ones\add* hungering and thirsting - ˱for˲_righteousness, because they /will_be_being/_satisfied.
\v 7 Blessed \add are\add* the merciful, because they /will_be_being/_shown_mercy.
\v 8 Blessed \add are\add* the pure - ˱in˲_heart, because they /will_be/_seeing - \nd God\nd*.
\v 9 Blessed \add are\add* the peacemaking, because they /will_be_being/_called sons ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*.
\v 10 Blessed \add are\add* the \add ones\add* /having_been/_persecuted on_account righteousness, because ˱to˲_them is the Kingdom ˱of˲_the Heavens.
\v 11 Blessed are_˱you_all˲ whenever ˱they˲_/may/_deride you_all and /may/_pursue and ˱they˲_/may/_say all evil lying against you_all on_account ˱of˲_me.
\v 12 /Be/_rejoicing and /be/_exulting, because the reward ˱of˲_you_all \add is\add* great in the heavens; for thus ˱they˲_persecuted the prophets - before you_all.
\v 13 ¶ You_all are the salt ˱of˲_the earth; but if the salt /may_be/_made_tasteless, with what ˱it˲_/will_be_being/_salted? ˱It˲_/is/_being_effective for nothing anymore, except - /having_been/_cast out, /to_be_being/_trampled by the people.
\v 14 ¶ You_all are the light ˱of˲_the world. /a/_city lying on /a/_mountain /Is/_=> not <=_able /to_be/_hidden.
\v 15 And_not ˱they˲_/are/_lighting /a/_lamp and /are/_putting it under - /a/_basket, but on the lampstand, and ˱it˲_/is/_shining ˱for˲_all the \add ones\add* in the house.
\v 16 Thus /let/_=> the light ˱of˲_you_all <=_shine before the people, so_that ˱they˲_/may/_see the good works ˱of˲_you_all, and /may/_glorify the Father ˱of˲_you_all - in the heavens.
\v 17 ¶ ˱You_all˲_/may/_=> not <=_think that ˱I˲_came /to/_tear_down the law or the prophets; ˱I˲_came not /to/_tear_down, but /to/_fulfill.
\v 18 For, truly ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all, until - heaven and - earth - /may/_pass_away, one Iota or one serif by_no_means /may/_=> not <=_pass_away from the law, until - all \add things\add* /may/_become.
\v 19 Whoever therefore if /may/_break ˱of˲_these the one ˱of˲_the commandments least, and /may/_teach the people thus, /will_be_being/_called least in the Kingdom ˱of˲_the Heavens; but whoever - /may/_practice and /may/_teach, this \add one\add* /will_be_being/_called great in the Kingdom ˱of˲_the Heavens.
\v 20 For ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all that if - righteousness ˱of˲_you_all not /may/_abound more ˱of˲_the scribes and Pharisees, by_no_means ˱you_all˲_/may/_=> not <=_come_in into the Kingdom ˱of˲_the Heavens.
\v 21 ¶ ˱You_all˲_heard that ˱it˲_/was/_said ˱to˲_the ancients, ‘“˱you˲_/will_ not _be/_murdering”, and whoever, - /may/_murder, will_be liable ˱to˲_the judgment.’
\v 22 But I /am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all that everyone - /being/_angered ˱by˲_the brother ˱of˲_him, will_be liable ˱to˲_the judgment; and whoever - /may/_say ˱to˲_the brother ˱of˲_him, ‘Raca’, will_be liable ˱to˲_the Sanhedrin; and whoever - /may/_say, ‘Foolish’, will_be liable to - Gehenna - ˱of˲_fire.
\v 23 Therefore if ˱you˲_/may_be/_offering the gift ˱of˲_you at the altar, and_there ˱you˲_/may_be/_reminded that the brother ˱of˲_you /is/_having something against you,
\v 24 leave the gift ˱of˲_you there before the altar. And /be/_going_away first /be/_reconciled ˱to˲_the brother ˱of˲_you, and then /having/_come, /be/_offering the gift ˱of˲_you.
\v 25 Be agreeing ˱with˲_the opponent ˱of˲_you quickly, as_long_as which ˱you˲_are with him on the way, lest the opponent /may/_give_ you _over ˱to˲_the judge, and the judge ˱to˲_the attendant, and ˱you˲_/will_be_being/_cast into prison.
\v 26 Truly, ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you, by_no_means ˱you˲_/may/_=> not <=_come_out from_there, until - ˱you˲_/may/_give_back the last quadran.
\v 27 ¶ ˱You_all˲_heard that ˱it˲_/was/_said, ‘˱you˲_/will_ not _be/_committing_adultery.’
\v 28 But I /am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all that everyone - looking ˱at˲_/a/_woman in_order that /to/_lust ˱for˲_her, already committed_adultery ˱with˲_her in the heart ˱of˲_him.
\v 29 And if the - right eye ˱of˲_you /is/_stumbling you, pluck_out it and cast \add it\add* from you, for ˱it˲_/is/_benefitting ˱for˲_you that one ˱of˲_the members ˱of˲_you /may/_perish, and all the body ˱of˲_you /may_ not _be/_cast into Gehenna.
\v 30 And if the right hand ˱of˲_you /is/_stumbling you, cut_off it and cast \add it\add* from you, for ˱it˲_/is/_benefitting ˱for˲_you that one ˱of˲_the members ˱of˲_you /may/_perish, and all the body ˱of˲_you /may/_=> not <=_go_away into Gehenna.
\v 31 ¶ And ˱it˲_/was/_said, ‘whoever - /may/_send_away the wife ˱of˲_him, ˱him˲_/let/_give divorce ˱to˲_her.’
\v 32 But I /am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all that everyone - sending_away the wife ˱of˲_him, except ˱on˲_account ˱of˲_sexual_immorality, /is/_making her /to_be/_committing_adultery, and whoever /may/_marry - /having_been/_sent_away \add her\add*, /is/_causing_adultery.
\v 33 ¶ Again ˱you_all˲_heard that ˱it˲_/was/_said ˱to˲_the ancients, ‘˱you˲_/will_ not _be/_perjuring, but ˱you˲_/will_be/_giving_back ˱to˲_the \nd Lord\nd* the oaths ˱of˲_you.’
\v 34 But I /am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all not /to/_=> actually <=_swear; neither by - heaven, because ˱it˲_is /the/_throne - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*;
\v 35 nor by the earth, because ˱it˲_is /the/_footstool ˱of˲_the feet ˱of˲_him; nor in Jerusalem, because ˱it˲_is /the/_city ˱of˲_the great King;
\v 36 nor /may/_˱you˲_swear by the head ˱of˲_you, because ˱you˲_/are/_=> not <=_being_able /to/_make one hair white. or black.
\v 37 But let_be the statement ˱of˲_you_all, yes \add be\add* yes, no \add be\add* no; and the additional \add than\add* these \add things\add* is from - evil.
\v 38 ¶ ˱You_all˲_heard that ˱it˲_/was/_said, ‘eye for /an/_eye and tooth for /a/_tooth.’
\v 39 But I /am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all, not /to/_resist ˱against˲_the evil; but whoever /is/_slapping \add you\add* you on the right cheek, ˱of˲_you turn ˱to˲_him also the other;
\v 40 and ˱to˲_the \add one\add* willing you /to_be/_judged and /to/_take the tunic ˱of˲_you, allow ˱to˲_him also your coat;
\v 41 and whoever you /may/_compel one mile, /be/_going with him two.
\v 42 ˱To˲_the \add one\add* requesting you, give, and ˱to˲_the \add one\add* wanting from you /to/_borrow, ˱you˲_/may_ not _be/_turned_away.
\v 43 ¶ ˱You_all˲_heard that ˱it˲_/was/_said, ‘“˱you˲_/will_be/_loving the neighbor ˱of˲_you”, and ˱you˲_/will_be/_hating the enemy ˱of˲_you.’
\v 44 But I /am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all, /be/_loving the /the/_enemies ˱of˲_you_all, and /be/_praying for the \add ones\add* persecuting you_all;
\v 45 so_that ˱you_all˲_/may/_become sons ˱of˲_the Father ˱of˲_you_all who in /the/_heavens, because ˱he˲_/is/_rising the sun ˱of˲_him on evil and good, and /is/_raining on /the/_righteous and unrighteous.
\v 46 For if ˱you_all˲_/may/_love the \add ones\add* loving you_all, what reward /are/_˱you_all˲_having? Not also the tax_collectors /are/_doing the same?
\v 47 And if ˱you_all˲_/may/_greet the brothers ˱of˲_you_all only, what additional \add things\add* /are/_˱you_all˲_doing? Not also the pagans /are/_doing the same?
\v 48 Therefore you_all will_be perfect as the heavenly Father ˱of˲_you_all - is perfect.
\c 6
\v 1 /be/_taking_heed not /to_be/_practicing the righteousness ˱of˲_you_all before the people, in_order that /to_be/_seen ˱by˲_them; and if not surely, ˱you_all˲_/are/_having no reward with the Father ˱of˲_you_all, who \add is\add* in the heavens.
\v 2 ¶ Therefore whenever ˱you˲_/may_be/_doing alms, ˱you˲_/may/_=> not <=_trumpet before you, as the hypocrites /are/_doing in the synagogues and in the streets, so_that ˱they˲_/may_be/_glorified by the people. Truly, ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all, ˱they˲_/are/_receiving_fully the reward ˱of˲_them.
\v 3 But ˱of˲_you doing alms, not /let/_know the left \add hand\add* ˱of˲_you what the right \add hand\add* ˱of˲_you /is/_doing,
\v 4 so_that the alms ˱of˲_you may_be in - secret; and the Father ˱of˲_you, the \add one\add* seeing in - secret, /will_be/_giving_back ˱to˲_you.
\v 5 ¶ And whenever ˱you˲_/may_be/_praying, ˱you_all˲_will_ not _be like the hypocrites, because ˱they˲_/are/_loving /to_be/_praying in the synagogues and /having/_stood on the corners ˱of˲_the roads, so_that ˱they˲_/may_be/_seen ˱by˲_the people. Truly, ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all, ˱they˲_/are/_receiving_fully the reward ˱of˲_them.
\v 6 But you whenever ˱you˲_/may_be/_praying, come_in into the private_room ˱of˲_you and /having/_shut the door ˱of˲_you, pray ˱to˲_the Father ˱of˲_you, who \add is\add* in - secret, and the Father ˱of˲_you, the \add one\add* seeing in - secret, /will_be/_giving_back ˱to˲_you.
\v 7 ¶ And praying ˱you_all˲_/may/_=> not <=_babble as the pagans, for ˱they˲_/are/_supposing that in the many_words ˱of˲_them ˱they˲_/will_be_being/_listened_to.
\v 8 Therefore ˱you_all˲_/may_ not _be/_likened ˱to˲_them, for the \nd God\nd* the Father ˱of˲_you_all /has/_known what \add things\add* ˱you_all˲_/are/_having need before the \add time\add* you_all /to/_request him.
\v 9 ¶ Therefore you_all /be/_praying thus: ‘Father ˱of˲_us, the \add one\add* in the heavens, /let_ the name ˱of˲_you _be/_sanctified.
\v 10 /let/_=> the kingdom ˱of˲_you <=_come, /let_be/_=> the will ˱of˲_you <=_become, on earth also as in heaven.
\v 11 Give ˱to˲_us today the - daily_needed bread ˱of˲_us.
\v 12 And forgive ˱to˲_us the debts ˱of˲_us, as we also forgave ˱to˲_the debtors ˱of˲_us.
\v 13 And ˱you˲_/may/_=> not <=_carry_in us into temptation, but rescue us from - evil.’
\v 14 For if ˱you_all˲_/may/_forgive - ˱to˲_people the transgressions ˱of˲_them, the - heavenly Father ˱of˲_you_all /will_ also _be/_forgiving ˱to˲_you_all.
\v 15 But if ˱you_all˲_/may/_=> not <=_forgive - ˱to˲_people the transgressions ˱of˲_them, neither the Father ˱of˲_you_all /will_be/_forgiving the transgressions ˱of˲_you_all.
\v 16 ¶ And whenever ˱you_all˲_/may_be/_fasting, /be/_=> not <=_becoming downcast like the hypocrites, for ˱they˲_/are/_disfiguring the appearances ˱of˲_them, so_that ˱they˲_/may_be/_seen ˱by˲_the people fasting. Truly, ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all, ˱they˲_/are/_receiving_fully the reward ˱of˲_them.
\v 17 But you fasting, anoint the head ˱of˲_you and wash the face ˱of˲_you,
\v 18 so_that ˱you˲_/may_ not _be/_seen ˱by˲_the people fasting, but ˱to˲_the Father ˱of˲_you who \add is\add* in - secret; and the Father ˱of˲_you, the \add one\add* seeing in - secret, /will_be/_giving_back ˱to˲_you.
\v 19 ¶ /Be/_=> not <=_storing_up treasures on the earth ˱for˲_you_all, where moth and corrosion /is/_destroy, and where thieves /are/_digging_through and /are/_stealing;
\v 20 but /be/_storing_up ˱for˲_you_all treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor corrosion /is/_destroying, and where thieves not /are/_digging_through nor /are/_stealing.
\v 21 For where the treasure ˱of˲_you is, there will_be also the heart ˱of˲_you.
\v 22 ¶ The lamp ˱of˲_the body is the eye. Therefore if the eye ˱of˲_you may_be healthy, the whole body ˱of˲_you will_be bright.
\v 23 But if the eye ˱of˲_you may_be evil, all the body ˱of˲_you will_be dark. Therefore if the light - in you \add is\add* darkness, how_great is the darkness!
\v 24 ¶ No_one /is/_able /to_be/_serving ˱for˲_two masters; for either ˱he˲_/will_be/_hating the one and ˱he˲_/will_be/_loving the other, or ˱he˲_/will_be/_upholding ˱of˲_/the/_one and ˱he˲_/will_be/_despising ˱of˲_the other. ˱You_all˲_/are/_=> not <=_being_able /to_be/_serving ˱for˲_\nd God\nd* and money.
\v 25 ¶ Because_of this ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all, /be/_=> not <=_worrying ˱for˲_the life ˱of˲_you_all what ˱you_all˲_/may/_eat or what ˱you_all˲_/may/_drink, nor ˱for˲_the body ˱of˲_you_all what ˱you_all˲_/may/_dress_in. Not the life is more \add than\add* the food, and the body \add than\add* the clothing?
\v 26 Consider on the birds ˱of˲_the sky, that neither ˱they˲_/are/_sowing, nor ˱they˲_/are/_reaping, nor ˱they˲_/are/_gathering_together into barns, and the - heavenly Father ˱of˲_you_all /is/_feeding them; /are/_=> not you_all <=_carrying_value more \add than\add* them?
\v 27 And who of you_all worrying /is/_able /to/_add one hour to the lifespan ˱of˲_him?
\v 28 And about clothing why /are/_˱you_all˲_worrying? Observe how the lilies ˱of˲_the field /are/_growing; ˱they˲_/are/_=> not <=_laboring nor /are/_˱they˲_spinning;
\v 29 but ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all that not_even Solomon in all the glory ˱of˲_him clothed like one ˱of˲_these.
\v 30 But if - \nd God\nd* /is/_=> thus <=_dressing the grass ˱of˲_the field being today, and tomorrow /being/_cast into /the/_furnace, not ˱by˲_much more ˱for˲_you_all, little_faith \add ones\add*?
\v 31 Therefore ˱you_all˲_/may/_=> not <=_worry saying, ‘What /may/_˱we˲_eat’, or, ‘What /may/_˱we˲_drink’, or, ‘What /may/_˱we˲_clothed?’
\v 32 For the pagans /are/_seeking_after all these \add things\add*.; for the - heavenly Father ˱of˲_you_all /has/_known that ˱you_all˲_/are/_needing ˱of˲_> all <_these \add things\add*.
\v 33 But /be/_seeking first the kingdom and the righteousness ˱of˲_him, and all these \add things\add* /will_be_being/_added ˱to˲_you_all.
\v 34 Therefore ˱you_all˲_/may/_=> not <=_worry for the_> next <_\add day\add*, for the_> next <_\add day\add* /will_be/_worrying ˱about˲_itself. The Evil ˱of˲_it sufficient ˱to˲_the day \add is\add*.
\c 7
\v 1 ¶ /Be/_=> not <=_judging, in_order_that ˱you_all˲_/may_ not _be/_judged;
\v 2 with for what judgment ˱you_all˲_/are/_judging, ˱you_all˲_/will_be_being/_judged, and with what measure ˱you_all˲_/are/_measuring, ˱it˲_/will_be_being/_measured ˱to˲_you_all.
\v 3 And why ˱you˲_/are/_looking the speck - in the eye ˱of˲_the brother ˱of˲_you, but ˱you˲_/are/_=> not <=_observing the \add speck\add* beam in - your eye?
\v 4 Or how ˱you˲_/will_be/_saying ˱to˲_the brother ˱of˲_you, ‘Allow \add that\add* ˱I˲_/may/_cast_out the speck from the eye ˱of˲_you’, and behold, the beam \add is\add* in the eye ˱of˲_you?
\v 5 Hypocrite, first cast_out the beam from the eye ˱of˲_you, and then ˱you˲_/will_be/_seeing_clearly /to/_cast_out the speck from the eye ˱of˲_the brother ˱of˲_you.
\v 6 ¶ ˱You_all˲_/may/_=> not <=_give the holy \add thing\add* ˱to˲_the dogs, nor ˱you_all˲_/may/_cast the pearls ˱of˲_you_all before the pigs, lest ˱they˲_/will_be/_trampling them with the feet ˱of˲_them, and /having_been/_turned ˱they˲_/may/_attack you_all.
\v 7 ¶ /Be/_requesting and ˱it˲_/will_be_being/_given ˱to˲_you_all; /be/_seeking and ˱you_all˲_/will_be/_finding; /be/_knocking and ˱it˲_/will_be_being/_opened_up ˱to˲_you_all.
\v 8 For everyone - requesting /is/_receiving, and the \add one\add* seeking /is/_finding, and ˱to˲_the \add one\add* knocking ˱it˲_/will_be_being/_opened_up.
\v 9 Or which /a/_person is of you_all, whom the son ˱of˲_him /will_be/_requesting /a/_loaf, not /will_be/_handing_out /a/_stone ˱to˲_him?
\v 10 Or also /will_be/_requesting /a/_fish, not /will_be/_handing_out /a/_serpent ˱to˲_him?
\v 11 Therefore if you_all being evil, /have/_known /to_be/_giving good gifts ˱to˲_the children ˱of˲_you_all, ˱to˲_how_much more the Father ˱of˲_you_all who \add is\add* in the heavens /will_be/_giving good \add things\add* ˱to˲_the \add ones\add* requesting him?
\v 12 ¶ Therefore all \add things\add*, if as_many_as ˱you_all˲_/may_be/_wanting that the people /may_be/_doing ˱to˲_you_all, thus you_all also /be/_doing ˱to˲_them. For this is the law and the prophets.
\v 13 ¶ Come_in through the narrow gate; because the gate \add is\add* wide and the way \add is\add* broad - leading_away to - destruction, and many are the \add ones\add* coming_in through it;
\v 14 how narrow \add is\add* the gate and the way - leading_away to - life /having_been/_narrowed \add is\add*, and few are the \add ones\add* finding it.
\v 15 ¶ /Be/_taking_heed of the false_prophets, who /are/_coming to you_all in clothing ˱of˲_sheep, but inside ˱they˲_are swindling wolves.
\v 16 ˱You_all˲_/will_be/_knowing them by the fruits ˱of˲_them. Surely_not ˱they˲_/are/_gathering grapes from thorns, or figs from thistles?
\v 17 Thus every good tree /is/_producing good fruits, but the bad tree /is/_producing evil fruits.
\v 18 /A/_=> good <=_tree /is/_=> not <=_able /to/_bear evil fruits, nor /a/_=> bad <=_tree /to_be/_producing good fruits.
\v 19 Every tree not producing good fruit /is_being/_cut_off and /is_being/_cast into fire.
\v 20 Consequently surely ˱you_all˲_/will_be/_knowing them by the fruits ˱of˲_them.
\v 21 ¶ Not everyone - saying ˱to˲_me, ‘\nd Lord\nd*, \nd Lord\nd*’, /will_be/_coming_in into the Kingdom ˱of˲_the Heavens, but the \add one\add* doing the will ˱of˲_the Father ˱of˲_me who \add is\add* in the heavens.
\v 22 Many /will_be/_saying ˱to˲_me on that - day, ‘\nd Lord\nd*, \nd Lord\nd*, not ˱we˲_prophesied - ˱in˲_your name, and ˱we˲_cast_out demons - ˱in˲_your name, and many - ˱in˲_your name miracles ˱we˲_did?’
\v 23 And then ˱I˲_/will_be/_confessing ˱to˲_them, - ‘˱I˲_> never <_knew you_all, “/be/_going_away from me, you_all working - lawlessness”.’
\v 24 ¶ Therefore everyone whoever /is/_hearing - these words ˱of˲_me and /is/_doing them, ˱they˲_/will_be_being/_likened ˱to˲_/a/_=> prudent <=_man, who built the house ˱of˲_him on the rock.
\v 25 And the rain came_down, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and ˱they˲_fell_against - ˱to˲_> that <_house, and ˱it˲_> not <_fell, for ˱it˲_/had_been/_established on the rock.
\v 26 And everyone - hearing - these words ˱of˲_me and not doing them, /will_be_being/_likened ˱to˲_/a/_=> foolish <=_man, who built the house ˱of˲_him on the sand.
\v 27 And the rain came_down, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and ˱they˲_struck - ˱against˲_> that <_house, and ˱it˲_fell and the fall ˱of˲_it was great.”
\v 28 ¶ And ˱it˲_became, when - \nd Jesus\nd* finished - these words, the crowds /were_being/_astonished; at the teaching ˱of˲_him;
\v 29 for ˱he˲_was teaching them as having authority, and not as the scribes ˱of˲_them.
\c 8
\v 1 ¶ And him /having/_come_down from the mountain, great crowds followed ˱after˲_him.
\v 2 And behold, /a/_leper /having/_approached, /was/_kneeling ˱to˲_him saying, “\nd Lord\nd*, if ˱you˲_/may_be/_willing, ˱you˲_/are/_being_able /to/_cleanse me.”
\v 3 And /having/_stretched_out his hand, ˱he˲_touched ˱against˲_him saying, “˱I˲_/am/_willing, /be/_cleansed.” And immediately - ˱of˲_leprosy ˱of˲_him /was/_cleansed.
\v 4 And - \nd Jesus\nd* /is/_saying ˱to˲_him, “/Be/_seeing ˱you˲_/may/_tell ˱to˲_no_one, but /be/_going yourself, show ˱to˲_the priest, and offer the gift which Moses commanded, for /a/_testimony ˱to˲_them.”
\v 5 ¶ And /having/_come_in ˱of˲_him into Capernaum, /a/_centurion approached ˱to˲_him imploring him
\v 6 and saying, \nd Lord\nd*, the paralytic servant ˱of˲_me /has_been/_laid in the house, /being/_tormented terribly.
\v 7 And ˱he˲_/is/_saying ˱to˲_him, “I /having/_come, /will_be/_healing him.”
\v 8 And the centurion answering /was/_saying, “\nd Lord\nd*, ˱I˲_am not worthy that ˱you˲_/may/_come_in under the roof ˱of˲_me, but only speak ˱by˲_/the/_word and the servant ˱of˲_me /will_be_being/_healed.
\v 9 For I also am /a/_man /being/_appointed under authority, having soldiers under myself, and ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_this \add one\add*, ‘/Be/_gone’, and ˱he˲_/is/_going, and ˱to˲_another, ‘/Be/_coming’, and ˱he˲_/is/_coming, and ˱to˲_the slave ˱of˲_me, ‘Do this’, and ˱he˲_/is/_doing \add it\add*.”
\v 10 And - \nd Jesus\nd* /having/_heard, marveled and said ˱to˲_the \add ones\add* following, “Truly, ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all, ˱I˲_found so_much faith from no_one in - Israel.
\v 11 And ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all that many from east and west /will_be/_coming and /will_be_being/_reclined with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the Kingdom ˱of˲_the Heavens;
\v 12 but the sons ˱of˲_the kingdom /will_be_being/_cast_out into the the outer darkness, there will_be - weeping and - gnashing - ˱of˲_teeth.”
\v 13 And - \nd Jesus\nd* said ˱to˲_the centurion, “/Be/_going, /let_˱it˲_/be_become ˱with˲_you as ˱you˲_believed.” And the servant /was/_healed in that - hour.
\v 14 ¶ And - \nd Jesus\nd* /having/_come to the house ˱of˲_Peter, ˱he˲_saw the mother_in_law ˱of˲_him /having_been/_laid and being_feverish,
\v 15 and ˱he˲_touched ˱against˲_the hand ˱of˲_her, and the fever left her, and ˱she˲_/was/_raised, and /was/_serving ˱unto˲_him.
\v 16 ¶ And /having/_become evening, ˱they˲_brought many ˱to˲_him being_demon_possessed, and ˱he˲_cast_out the spirits ˱by˲_/a/_word, and ˱he˲_healed all the \add ones\add* being sickly;
\v 17 so_that the \add word\add* /may_be/_fulfilled /having_been/_spoken by Isaiah the prophet saying, “himself took the sicknesses ˱of˲_us and bore the diseases.”
\v 18 ¶ And - \nd Jesus\nd* /having/_seen crowd around him, ˱he˲_commanded \add them\add* /to/_go_away to the \add side\add* across.
\v 19 And one scribe /having/_approached, said ˱to˲_him, “Teacher, ˱I˲_/will_be/_following ˱after˲_you wherever - ˱you˲_/may_be/_going_away.”
\v 20 And - \nd Jesus\nd* /is/_saying ˱to˲_him, “- foxes /are/_having burrows and - birds ˱of˲_the sky nests, but - /the/_Son - ˱of˲_Man /is/_having no where ˱he˲_/may_be/_laying his head.”
\v 21 And another ˱of˲_the disciples said ˱to˲_him, “\nd Lord\nd*, permit ˱to˲_me first /to/_go_away and /to/_bury the father ˱of˲_me.”
\v 22 But - \nd Jesus\nd* /is/_saying ˱to˲_him, “/Be/_following ˱after˲_me and leave the dead /to/_bury - dead ˱by˲_themselves.”
\v 23 ¶ And the disciples ˱of˲_him /having/_boarded ˱with˲_him into /the/_boat, followed ˱after˲_him.
\v 24 And behold, /a/_=> great <=_storm became in the sea, so_that the boat /to_be_being/_covered by the waves, but he /was/_sleeping.
\v 25 And /having/_approached, ˱they˲_raised him saying, “\nd Lord\nd*, save \add us\add*, ˱we˲_/are/_perishing!”
\v 26 And ˱he˲_/is/_saying ˱to˲_them, “Why are_˱you_all˲ fearful, little_faith \add ones\add*?” Then /having_been/_raised, ˱he˲_gave_rebuke ˱to˲_the winds and the sea, and /a/_=> great <=_calm became.
\v 27 And the people marveled saying, “What_kind_of \add man\add* is this, that both the winds and the sea /are/_submitting ˱to˲_him?”
\v 28 ¶ And him /having/_come to the \add side\add* across to the region ˱of˲_the Gadarenes, two being_demon_possessed met ˱with˲_him coming_out out_of the tombs, exceedingly dangerous so_that not anyone /to_be/_was_able /to/_pass_by by - that way.
\v 29 And behold, ˱they˲_cried_out saying, “What ˱to˲_us and ˱to˲_you, Son - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*? ˱You˲_came here /to/_torment us before /the/_time?”
\v 30 And /a/_herd ˱of˲_> many <_pigs was far from them /being/_fed.
\v 31 And the demons /were/_imploring him saying, “If ˱you˲_/are/_casting_ us _out, send_ us _out into the herd - ˱of˲_pigs.”
\v 32 And ˱he˲_said ˱to˲_them, “/Be/_going.” And - /having/_come_out ˱they˲_went_away into the pigs; and behold, all the herd rushed down the steep_bank into the sea, and ˱they˲_died_off in the waters.
\v 33 And the \add ones\add* feeding \add them\add* fled, and /having/_gone_away into the city, ˱they˲_reported all \add things\add* and the \add things\add* ˱of˲_the \add ones\add* being_demon_possessed.
\v 34 And behold, all the city came_out to /a/_meeting - ˱with˲_\nd Jesus\nd*, and /having/_seen him, ˱they˲_implored \add him\add* that ˱he˲_/may/_depart from the regions ˱of˲_them.
\c 9
\v 1 ¶ And /having/_boarded into /a/_boat, ˱he˲_crossed_over and came to his own city.
\v 2 ¶ And behold, ˱they˲_/were/_bringing /a/_paralytic ˱to˲_him on /a/_bed /having_been/_laid. And - \nd Jesus\nd* /having/_seen the faith ˱of˲_them, ˱he˲_said ˱to˲_the paralytic, “/Be/_having_courage, child, the sins ˱of˲_you /are_being/_forgiven.”
\v 3 And behold, some ˱of˲_the scribes said among themselves, “This \add man\add* /is/_slandering!”
\v 4 And - \nd Jesus\nd* /having/_seen the thoughts ˱of˲_them said, “for_ Why _reason /are/_˱you_all˲_considering evil in the hearts ˱of˲_you_all?
\v 5 For which is easier /to/_say, ‘The sins ˱of˲_you /Are_being/_forgiven’, or /to/_say, ‘/Be/_raising and /be/_walking’?
\v 6 But in_order_that ˱you_all˲_/may_have/_known that the Son - ˱of˲_Man /is/_having authority on the earth /to_be/_forgiving sins” (then ˱he˲_/is/_saying ˱to˲_the paralytic), “/Having_been/_raised, take_up the bed ˱of˲_you and /be/_going to the house ˱of˲_you.”
\v 7 And /having_been/_raised, ˱he˲_went_away to the house ˱of˲_him.
\v 8 But /having/_seen \add this\add*, the crowds /were/_afraid and ˱they˲_glorified - \nd God\nd*, who /having/_given such authority - ˱to˲_humans.
\v 9 ¶ And - \nd Jesus\nd* passing_by from_there, ˱he˲_saw /a/_man /being/_called Matthew sitting at the tax_office, and ˱he˲_/is/_saying ˱to˲_him. “/Be/_following ˱after˲_me.” And /having/_risen_up, ˱he˲_followed ˱after˲_him.
\v 10 ¶ And ˱it˲_became ˱of˲_him reclining in the house, and behold, many tax_collectors and sinners /having/_come /were/_reclining - ˱with˲_\nd Jesus\nd* and the disciples ˱of˲_him.
\v 11 And /having/_seen \add it\add*, the Pharisees /were/_saying ˱to˲_the disciples ˱of˲_him, “for_ Why _reason /is/_=> the teacher ˱of˲_you_all <=_eating with the tax_collectors and sinners?”
\v 12 And he /having/_heard said, “The \add ones\add* being_strong /are/_=> not <=_having need ˱of˲_/a/_physician, but the \add ones\add* being sickly.
\v 13 But /having_been/_gone, learn what is \add this\add*: ‘˱I˲_/am/_wanting ‘mercy and not sacrifice’, for ˱I˲_came not /to/_call /the/_righteous \add ones\add*, but sinners.”
\v 14 ¶ Then the disciples ˱of˲_John /are/_approaching ˱to˲_him saying, “for_ Why _reason we and the Pharisees /are/_fasting, but the disciples ˱of˲_you /are/_=> not <=_fasting?”
\v 15 And - \nd Jesus\nd* said ˱to˲_them, “The sons ˱of˲_the bridal_chamber “/Are/_=> not <=_being_able /to_be/_mourning, for as_long_as the bridegroom is with them? But days /will_be/_coming whenever the bridegroom /may_be/_taken_away from them, and then ˱they˲_/will_be/_fasting.
\v 16 But no_one /is/_putting_on /a/_patch ˱of˲_> unshrunken <_cloth on /a/_=> old <=_garment; for /is/_tearing_away the patch ˱of˲_it from the garment, and /a/_worse tear /is/_becoming.
\v 17 Nor ˱they˲_/are/_putting new wine into old wineskins; and if not surely, the wineskins /are_being/_burst, and the wine /is_being/_poured_out and the wineskins /are_being/_destroyed. But ˱they˲_/are/_putting new wine into new wineskins, and both /are_being/_preserved.”
\v 18 ˱of˲_him speaking ¶ These \add things\add* ˱to˲_them, behold, one ruler /having/_approached, ˱he˲_/was/_kneeling ˱to˲_him saying, - “The daughter ˱of˲_me now died; but /having/_come lay_on the hand ˱of˲_you on her and ˱she˲_/will_be/_living.”
\v 19 And - \nd Jesus\nd* /having_been/_raised, followed ˱after˲_him and the disciples ˱of˲_him.
\v 20 And behold, /a/_woman hemorrhaging twelve years /having/_approached behind, ˱she˲_touched ˱against˲_the fringe ˱of˲_the garment ˱of˲_him.
\v 21 For ˱she˲_/was/_saying in herself, “If only ˱I˲_/may/_touch ˱against˲_the garment ˱of˲_him, ˱I˲_/will_be_being/_healed.”
\v 22 But - \nd Jesus\nd* /having_been/_turned and /having/_seen her said, “/Be/_having_courage, daughter; the faith ˱of˲_you /has/_healed you.” And the woman /was/_healed from - that hour.
\v 23 And - \nd Jesus\nd* /having/_come into the house ˱of˲_the ruler, and /having/_seen the flute_players and the crowd /being/_distressed
\v 24 ˱he˲_/was/_saying, “/Be/_withdrawing, for the little_girl not died_off, but ˱she˲_/is/_sleeping.” And ˱they˲_/were/_ridiculing ˱of˲_him.
\v 25 But when the crowd /was/_cast_out, /having/_come_in ˱he˲_took_hold ˱of˲_the hand ˱of˲_her, and the little_girl /was/_raised.
\v 26 And - this news came_out into all the that land.
\v 27 ¶ And passing_by from_there - ˱with˲_\nd Jesus\nd*, two blind \add men\add* followed ˱after˲_him crying_out and saying, “Show_mercy ˱to˲_us, son ˱of˲_David.”
\v 28 And /having/_come into the house, the blind \add men\add* approached ˱to˲_him, and - \nd Jesus\nd* /is/_saying ˱to˲_them, “˱You_all˲_/are/_believing that ˱I˲_/am/_being_able /to/_do this?” ˱They˲_/are/_saying ˱to˲_him, “Yes, \nd Lord\nd*.”
\v 29 Then ˱he˲_touched ˱against˲_the eyes ˱of˲_them saying, “According_to the faith ˱of˲_you_all /let_˱it˲_/be_become ˱to˲_you_all.”
\v 30 And the eyes ˱of˲_them /were/_opened_up. And - \nd Jesus\nd* /was/_admonished ˱to˲_them saying, “/Be/_seeing \add that\add* /let_ no_one _be/_knowing.”
\v 31 But the \add ones\add* /having/_come_out, ˱they˲_spread_ him _abroad in all - that land.
\v 32 ¶ And them coming_out, behold, ˱they˲_brought ˱to˲_him mute being_demon_possessed.
\v 33 And the demon /having_been/_cast_out, the mute \add man\add* spoke. And the crowds marveled saying, “˱It˲_/was/_=> never <=_seen thus in - Israel.”
\v 34 But the Pharisees /were/_saying, “˱He˲_/is/_casting_out - demons by the ruler ˱of˲_the demons.”
\v 35 ¶ And - \nd Jesus\nd* /was/_going_around all the cities and the villages, teaching in the synagogues ˱of˲_them, and proclaiming the gospel ˱of˲_the kingdom, and healing every disease and every sickness.
\v 36 And /having/_seen the crowds, ˱he˲_/was/_feeling_compassion for them, because ˱they˲_were /having_been/_troubled and /having_been/_helpless, as_if sheep not having /a/_shepherd.
\v 37 Then ˱he˲_/is/_saying ˱to˲_the disciples ˱of˲_him, “On_one_hand the harvest \add is\add* great, on_the_other_hand the workers \add are\add* few;
\v 38 therefore /be/_besought ˱of˲_the \nd Lord\nd* ˱of˲_the harvest, so_that ˱he˲_/may/_send_forth workers into the harvest ˱of˲_him.”
\c 10
\v 1 ¶ And /having/_called_to the twelve disciples ˱of˲_him, ˱he˲_gave ˱to˲_them authority ˱over˲_> unclean <_spirits, so_as /to_be/_casting_ them _out and /to_be/_healing every disease and every sickness.
\v 2 And - ˱of˲_/the/_twelve ambassadors the names is these: first Simon - /being/_called Peter, and Andrew the brother ˱of˲_him, and Jacobus the \add son\add* - ˱of˲_Zebedee, and John the brother ˱of˲_him,
\v 3 Philip and Bartholomew, Thomas and Matthew the tax_collector, Jacobus the \add son\add* - ˱of˲_Alpheus also \add was\add* Thaddeus,
\v 4 Simon the Canaanite and Judas - Iscariot, who also /having/_given_ him _over.
\v 5 ¶ - \nd Jesus\nd* sent_out these - twelve /having/_commanded ˱to˲_them saying, “˱You_all˲_/may/_=> not <=_go_away into /the/_way ˱of˲_/the/_pagans, and ˱you_all˲_/may/_=> not <=_come_in into city ˱of˲_/the/_Samaritans;
\v 6 but rather /be/_going to the - /having/_lost sheep ˱of˲_/the/_house ˱of˲_Israel.
\v 7 And going /be/_proclaiming saying, - the Kingdom ˱of˲_the Heavens ‘/Has/_neared.’
\v 8 /Be/_healing ailing \add ones\add*, /be/_raising /the/_dead; /be/_cleansing /the/_lepers, /be/_casting_out demons; ˱you_all˲_received undeservedly, give undeservedly.
\v 9 ˱You_all˲_/may/_=> neither <=_acquire gold, nor silver, nor copper in the belts ˱of˲_you_all,
\v 10 nor knapsack for /the/_way, nor two tunics, nor sandals, nor staff; for the worker \add is\add* worthy ˱of˲_the food ˱of˲_him.
\v 11 and Into whatever - city or village ˱you_all˲_/may/_come_in, search_out who in it is worthy, and_ remain _there until - ˱you_all˲_/may/_come_out.
\v 12 And coming_in into the house, greet it.
\v 13 And if on_one_hand the house may_be worthy, /let/_=> the peace ˱of˲_you_all <=_come on it; on_the_other_hand if may_be not worthy, /let_ the peace ˱of˲_you_all _be/_returned to you_all.
\v 14 And whoever - /may/_=> not <=_receive you_all, nor /may/_hear the words ˱of˲_you_all, coming_out out ˱of˲_the house or - that city, shake_off the dust ˱of˲_the feet ˱of˲_you_all.
\v 15 Truly, ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all, ˱it˲_will_be more_tolerable ˱for˲_/the/_land ˱of˲_Sodom and ˱of˲_Gomorrah on /the/_day ˱of˲_judgment, than - ˱for˲_> that <_city.
\v 16 ¶ Behold, I /am/_sending_ you_all _out as sheep in /the/_midst ˱of˲_wolves; therefore /be/_becoming shrewd as - serpents and innocent as the doves.
\v 17 But /be/_taking_heed of - people; for ˱they˲_/will_be/_giving_ you_all _over into councils, and ˱they˲_/will_be/_flogging you_all in the synagogues ˱of˲_them;
\v 18 and ˱you_all˲_/will_be_being/_brought before and governors also kings on_account me, for /a/_testimony ˱to˲_them and ˱to˲_the pagans.
\v 19 But whenever ˱they˲_/may/_give_ you_all _over, ˱you_all˲_/may/_=> not <=_worry how or what ˱you_all˲_/may/_speak; for what ˱you_all˲_/may/_speak /will_be_being/_given ˱to˲_you_all in that - hour.
\v 20 For you_all are not the \add ones\add* speaking, but the \nd Spirit\nd* ˱of˲_the Father ˱of˲_you_all - speaking in you_all.
\v 21 And brother /will_be/_giving_over brother to death, and father child, and children /will_be/_rising_up against parents, and ˱they˲_/will_be/_putting_ them _to_death.
\v 22 And ˱you_all˲_will_be /being/_hated by all because_of the name ˱of˲_me; but the \add one\add* /having/_endured to /the/_end, this \add one\add* /will_be_being/_saved.
\v 23 But whenever ˱they˲_/may_be/_persecuting you_all in - this city, /be/_fleeing to the next; for, truly ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all, by_no_means ˱you_all˲_/may/_=> not <=_finish the cities ˱of˲_the Israel, until the Son - ˱of˲_Man /may/_come.
\v 24 ¶ /A/_disciple is not above the teacher, nor /a/_slave above the master ˱of˲_him.
\v 25 Sufficient \add it_is\add* ˱for˲_the disciple that ˱he˲_/may/_become as the teacher ˱of˲_him, and the slave as the master ˱of˲_him. If ˱they˲_called the home_owner Beelzeboul, ˱to˲_how_much more the household ˱of˲_him?
\v 26 ¶ Therefore not /be/_afraid ˱of˲_them; for nothing is /having_been/_covered which /will_ not _be_being/_revealed, and hidden which /will_ not _be_being/_known.
\v 27 What ˱I˲_/am/_telling ˱to˲_you_all in the darkness, speak in the light; and what ˱you_all˲_/are/_hearing in the ear, proclaim on the housetops.
\v 28 And not /be/_afraid of the \add ones\add* killing_off the body, but not being_able /to/_kill_off the soul; but rather /be/_fearing the \add one\add* being_able /to/_destroy both soul and body in Gehenna.
\v 29 Not two sparrows /is_being/_sold ˱for˲_/an/_assarion? And not one of them /will_be/_falling to the ground, apart_from the Father ˱of˲_you_all.
\v 30 But the hairs ˱of˲_the head ˱of˲_you_all also are all /having_been/_numbered.
\v 31 Therefore /be/_=> not <=_fearing; you_all /are/_carrying_value \add than\add* many sparrows.
\v 32 ¶ Therefore everyone who /will_be/_confessing in me before - people, also_I /will_be/_confessing in him before the Father ˱of˲_me who \add is\add* in /the/_heavens.
\v 33 But whoever /may/_disown me before - people, also_I /will_be/_disowning him before the Father ˱of˲_me who \add is\add* in /the/_heavens.
\v 34 ¶ Not ˱you_all˲_/may/_think that ˱I˲_came /to/_bring peace to the earth; ˱I˲_came not /to/_bring peace, but /a/_sword.
\v 35 For ˱I˲_came ‘/to/_divide /a/_man against the father ˱of˲_him, and /a/_daughter against the mother ˱of˲_her, and /a/_daughter-in-law against the mother_in_law ˱of˲_her
\v 36 and enemies ˱of˲_the person the household ˱of˲_him’.
\v 37 The \add one\add* loving father or mother above me, is not worthy ˱of˲_me; and the \add one\add* loving son or daughter above me, is not worthy ˱of˲_me.
\v 38 And who /is/_=> not <=_taking the cross ˱of˲_him and /is/_following after me, is not worthy ˱of˲_me.
\v 39 The \add one\add* /having/_found the life ˱of˲_him /will_be/_losing it, and the \add one\add* /having/_lost the life ˱of˲_him on_account me /will_be/_finding it.
\v 40 ¶ The \add one\add* receiving you_all /is/_receiving me, and the \add one\add* receiving me /is/_receiving the \add one\add* /having/_sent_ me _out.
\v 41 The \add one\add* receiving /a/_prophet in name ˱of˲_/a/_prophet, /will_be/_receiving /the/_reward ˱of˲_/a/_prophet, and the \add one\add* receiving /a/_righteous \add one\add* in /the/_name ˱of˲_/a/_righteous \add one\add*, /will_be/_receiving /the/_reward ˱of˲_/a/_righteous \add one\add*.
\v 42 And whoever - /may/_give_to_drink one - ˱of˲_these ˱of˲_little \add ones\add* /a/_cup ˱of˲_cool \add water\add*, only in /the/_name ˱of˲_/a/_disciple, truly, ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all, by_no_means ˱he˲_/may/_=> not <=_lose the reward ˱of˲_him.”
\c 11
\v 1 ¶ And ˱it˲_became when - \nd Jesus\nd* finished directing ˱to˲_the twelve disciples ˱of˲_him, ˱he˲_departed from_there - /to_be/_teaching and /to_be/_proclaiming in the cities ˱of˲_them.
\v 2 ¶ And - John, /having/_heard in the prison the works ˱of˲_the \nd Messiah\nd*, /having/_sent through ˱of˲_the disciples ˱of˲_him,
\v 3 said ˱to˲_him, “Are you the \add one\add* coming, or /are/_˱we˲_waiting ˱for˲_another?”
\v 4 And - \nd Jesus\nd* answering said ˱to˲_them, “/Having_been/_gone report ˱to˲_John what ˱you_all˲_/are/_hearing and ˱you_all˲_/are/_seeing:
\v 5 ‘blind /are/_receiving_sight’, and lame /are/_walking, lepers /are_being/_cleansed, and deaf /are/_hearing, and dead /are_being/_raised, and ‘poor /are_being/_gospel_preached’.
\v 6 And ˱he˲_is blessed who - /may_ not _be/_offended in me.”
\v 7 ¶ And these going, - \nd Jesus\nd* began /to_be/_saying ˱to˲_the crowds concerning John, ˱you_all˲_came_out into the desert /to/_see “What? /A/_reed /being/_shaken by wind?
\v 8 But ˱you_all˲_came_out /to/_see? what /A/_man /having_been/_dressed in fine \add clothes\add*? Behold, the \add ones\add* wearing - fine \add clothes\add* in the houses ˱of˲_the kings
\v 9 but why ˱you_all˲_came_out? /To/_see /a/_prophet? Yes, ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all, and more_important \add than\add* /a/_prophet.
\v 10 This \add one\add* is concerning whom ˱it˲_/has_been/_written, ‘behold, I /am/_sending_out the messenger ˱of˲_me before /the/_face ˱of˲_you, who /will_be/_preparing the way ˱of˲_you before you.’
\v 11 Truly, ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all, not /has_been/_raised among /the/_born \add ones\add* ˱of˲_women greater \add than\add* John the Baptist. But - /the/_least in the Kingdom ˱of˲_the Heavens, is greater \add than\add* he.
\v 12 And from the days ˱of˲_John the Baptist until now, the Kingdom ˱of˲_the Heavens /is/_forcing, and forceful_men ˱they˲_/are/_snatching it.
\v 13 For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.
\v 14 And if ˱you_all˲_/are/_willing /to/_receive \add it\add*, he is Elijah, the \add one\add* going /to_be/_coming.
\v 15 The \add one\add* having ears /to_be/_hearing, /let_˱him˲_/be_hearing.
\v 16 ¶ But ˱to˲_what ˱I˲_/will_be/_likening - this generation? ˱It˲_is similar ˱to˲_little_children sitting in the marketplaces, who calling_out ˱to˲_the others
\v 17 /are/_saying, ‘˱We˲_played_the_flute ˱for˲_you_all and ˱you_all˲_> not <_danced; ˱we˲_lamented and ˱you_all˲_> not <_mourn.’
\v 18 For John came neither eating nor drinking, and ˱they˲_/are/_saying, ‘˱He˲_/is/_having /a/_demon.’
\v 19 the Son - ˱of˲_Man Came eating and drinking, and ˱they˲_/are/_saying, ‘Behold, /a/_man, /a/_glutton and /a/_drunkard, /a/_friend ˱of˲_tax_collectors and ˱of˲_sinners!’ But - wisdom /was/_justified by the her children.”
\v 20 ¶ Then ˱he˲_began /to_be/_deriding the cities in which the most miracles ˱of˲_him became, because ˱they˲_> not <_repented.
\v 21 Woe ˱to˲_you, Chorazin! Woe ˱to˲_you, Bethsaida! Because if the miracles - /having/_become in you_all became in Tyre and Sidon, long_ago ˱they˲_> would <_repented in sackcloth and ashes.
\v 22 However ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all, ˱it˲_will_be more_tolerable ˱for˲_Tyre and Sidon in day ˱of˲_judgment than ˱for˲_you_all.
\v 23 Also you, Capernaum, /will_ not _be_being/_exalted to heaven? ˱You˲_/will_be/_coming_down to Hades. Because if the miracles which /having/_become in you, /were/_become in Sodom, would remained until the \add day\add* today.
\v 24 However ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all that ˱it˲_will_be more_tolerable ˱for˲_/the/_land ˱of˲_Sodom in day ˱of˲_judgment than ˱for˲_you.
\v 25 ¶ At that - time - \nd Jesus\nd* answering said, “˱I˲_/am/_confessing ˱to˲_you, Father, \nd Lord\nd* ˱of˲_the heaven and the earth, that ˱you˲_hid these \add things\add* from wise and intelligent, and ˱you˲_revealed them ˱to˲_infants.
\v 26 Yes, - Father, because thus ˱it˲_became good_pleasure before you.
\v 27 All \add things\add* /was/_given_over ˱to˲_me by the Father ˱of˲_me, and no_one /is/_knowing_fully the Son, except - the Father, nor anyone /is/_knowing_fully the Father, except - the Son, and ˱to˲_whom if the Son /may_be/_wishing /to/_reveal \add him\add*.
\v 28 ¶ Come to me, all you_all wearied and /having_been/_burdened, and_I /will_be/_resting you_all.
\v 29 Take_up the yoke ˱of˲_me on you_all, and learn from me, because ˱I˲_am gentle and humble - ˱in˲_heart, ‘and ˱you_all˲_/will_be/_finding rest ˱for˲_the souls ˱of˲_you_all’.
\v 30 For the yoke ˱of˲_me \add is\add* easy and the burden ˱of˲_me is light.”
\c 12
\v 1 ¶ At that - time, - \nd Jesus\nd* /was/_gone ˱on˲_the Sabbaths through the grainfields; and the /the/_disciples ˱of˲_him hungered, and began /to_be/_plucking heads_of_grain and /to_be/_eating.
\v 2 And the Pharisees /having/_seen, said ˱to˲_him, “Behold, the disciples ˱of˲_you /are/_doing what ˱it˲_/is/_=> not <=_permitting /to_be/_doing on /the/_Sabbath.”
\v 3 But he said ˱to˲_them, “Not ˱you_all˲_read what David did, when ˱he˲_hungered and the \add ones\add* with him?
\v 4 How ˱he˲_came_in into the house - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*, and ˱they˲_ate the bread ˱of˲_the Presence, which ˱it˲_was not permitting ˱for˲_him /to/_eat, nor ˱for˲_the \add ones\add* with him, except only - ˱for˲_the priests?
\v 5 Or ˱you_all˲_> not <_read in the law that ˱on˲_the Sabbaths the priests in the temple /are/_profaning the Sabbath, and ˱they˲_are innocent?
\v 6 But ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all that \add one\add* greater \add than\add* the temple is here.
\v 7 But if ˱you_all˲_/had/_known what \add this\add* is: ‘˱I˲_/am/_wanting ‘mercy and not sacrifice’, ˱you_all˲_> would not <_convicted the innocent.
\v 8 For the Son - ˱of˲_Man is \nd Lord\nd* ˱of˲_the Sabbath.”
\v 9 ¶ And /having/_departed from_there, ˱he˲_came into the synagogue ˱of˲_them.
\v 10 And behold, /a/_man having /a/_=> withered <=_hand. And ˱they˲_asked him saying, “- /is/_˱it˲_permitting /to_be/_healing ˱on˲_the Sabbaths?” In_order_that ˱they˲_/may/_accuse ˱against˲_him.
\v 11 And he said ˱to˲_them, “What person will_be of you_all, who /will_be/_having one sheep, and if this /may/_fall_in into /a/_pit ˱on˲_the Sabbaths, /will_ not _be/_taking_hold_of it and /will_be/_raising \add it\add*?
\v 12 ˱For˲_how_much therefore /a/_human /is/_carrying_value \add than\add* /a/_sheep? So_then ˱it˲_/is/_permitting /to_be/_doing good ˱on˲_the Sabbaths.”
\v 13 Then ˱he˲_/is/_saying ˱to˲_the man, “Stretch_out the hand ˱of˲_you.” And ˱he˲_stretched_out \add it\add*, and ˱it˲_/was/_restored, healthy as the other.
\v 14 But, the Pharisees /having/_come_out received /a/_counsel against him, so_that ˱they˲_/may/_destroy him.
\v 15 ¶ But - \nd Jesus\nd* /having/_known, withdrew from_there. And /a/_great \add many\add* followed ˱after˲_him, and ˱he˲_healed them all,
\v 16 and ˱he˲_warned ˱to˲_them that ˱they˲_/may/_=> not <=_make him manifest.
\v 17 In_order_that the \add word\add* /may_be/_fulfilled /having_been/_spoken by Isaiah the prophet saying,
\v 18 “behold, the servant ˱of˲_me whom ˱I˲_chose, the beloved ˱of˲_me whom the soul ˱of˲_me took_pleasure. ˱I˲_/will_be/_putting the \nd Spirit\nd* ˱of˲_me on him, and ˱he˲_/will_be/_reporting justice ˱to˲_the pagans.
\v 19 ˱He˲_/will_ not _be/_quarreling, nor /will_be/_crying_out, nor /will_ anyone _be/_hearing the voice ˱of˲_him in the roads.
\v 20 By_no_means ˱he˲_/will_be/_breaking /a/_reed /having_been/_bruised, and by_no_means ˱he˲_/will_be/_extinguishing /a/_wick /being/_smoldering, until - ˱he˲_/may/_send_forth - justice to victory.
\v 21 And /the/_pagans /will_be/_hoping ˱in˲_the name ˱of˲_him.”
\v 22 ¶ Then /a/_being_demon_possessed \add man\add* /was/_brought ˱to˲_him, blind and mute, and ˱he˲_healed him, so_that the mute \add man\add* /to_be/_speaking and /to_be/_seeing.
\v 23 And all the crowds /were/_marveling and /were/_saying, “Surely_not this \add one\add* is the son ˱of˲_David?”
\v 24 And the Pharisees /having/_heard said, “This \add man\add* /is/_=> not <=_casting_out - demons, except - by - Beelzeboul, ruler ˱of˲_the demons.”
\v 25 And /having/_known the thoughts ˱of˲_them, ˱he˲_said ˱to˲_them, “Every kingdom /having_been/_divided against itself /is_being/_desolated, and every city or house /having_been/_divided against itself /will_ not _be_being/_stood.
\v 26 And if - Satan /is/_casting_out - Satan, ˱he˲_/was/_divided against himself. Therefore how /will_ the kingdom ˱of˲_him _be_being/_established?
\v 27 And if I /am/_casting_out - demons by Beelzeboul, the sons ˱of˲_you_all by whom /are/_˱they˲_casting_out? Because_of this, they will_be judges ˱of˲_you_all.
\v 28 But if by /the/_\nd Spirit\nd* ˱of˲_\nd God\nd* I /am/_casting_out - demons, consequently the Kingdom - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd* came on you_all.
\v 29 Or how /is/_able anyone /to/_come_in into the house ˱of˲_the strong \add man\add* and /to/_snatch the goods ˱of˲_him, if not first ˱he˲_/may/_bind the strong \add man\add*? And then ˱he˲_/will_be/_thoroughly_plundering the household ˱of˲_him.
\v 30 The \add one\add* not being with me is against me, and the \add one\add* not gathering_together with me /is/_scattering.
\v 31 Because_of this ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all, every sin and slander /will_be_being/_forgiven ˱to˲_the people, but the slander ˱of˲_the \nd Spirit\nd* /will_ not _be_being/_forgiven.
\v 32 And if whoever /may/_speak /a/_word against the Son - ˱of˲_Man, ˱it˲_/will_be_being/_forgiven ˱to˲_him; but whoever - /may/_speak against the - Holy \nd Spirit\nd*, ˱it˲_/will_ not _be_being/_forgiven ˱to˲_him, neither in this the age nor in the \add one\add* coming.
\v 33 ¶ Either make the tree good and the fruit ˱of˲_it good, or make the tree bad and the fruit ˱of˲_it bad; for the tree /is_being/_known by the fruit.
\v 34 Brood ˱of˲_vipers, being evil how ˱you_all˲_/are/_being_able /to_be/_speaking good \add things\add*? For the mouth /is/_speaking out_of the excess ˱of˲_the heart.
\v 35 The good person /is/_sending_forth good out_of his good treasure, and the evil person /is/_sending_forth evil out_of his evil treasure.
\v 36 But ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all that every idle word that the people /will_be/_speaking, ˱they˲_/will_be/_giving_back /an/_account for it in day ˱of˲_judgment.
\v 37 For by the words ˱of˲_you ˱you˲_/will_be_being/_justified, and by the words ˱of˲_you ˱you˲_/will_be_being/_convicted.”
\v 38 ¶ Then some ˱of˲_the scribes and Pharisees answered ˱to˲_him saying, “Teacher, ˱we˲_/are/_wanting /to/_see /a/_sign from you.”
\v 39 But he answering said ˱to˲_them, /a/_=> “evil and adulterous <=_generation /is/_seeking_after /a/_sign, and /a/_sign /will_ not _be_being/_given ˱to˲_it, except - the sign ˱of˲_Jonah the prophet.
\v 40 For as ‘Jonah was in the belly ˱of˲_the three huge_fish three days and nights’, thus the Son - ˱of˲_Man will_be ˱of˲_the days and three nights in the heart three earth.
\v 41 /The/_=> Ninevites <=_men /will_be/_standing_up in the judgment with the this generation, and ˱they˲_/will_be/_condemning it; because ˱they˲_repented at the proclamation ˱of˲_Jonah, and behold, /one/_greater \add than\add* Jonah \add is\add* here.
\v 42 /The/_queen ˱of˲_/the/_south /will_be_being/_raised in the judgment with the this generation, and /will_be/_condemning it; because ˱she˲_came from the ends ˱of˲_the earth /to/_hear the wisdom ˱of˲_Solomon, and behold, /one/_greater \add than\add* Solomon \add is\add* here.
\v 43 ¶ And whenever the unclean spirit /may/_come_out from the person, ˱it˲_/is/_passing_through through waterless places seeking rest and ˱it˲_/is/_=> not <=_finding.
\v 44 Then ˱it˲_/is/_saying, ˱I˲_/will_be/_turning_back to the house ˱of˲_me whence ˱I˲_came_out.’ And /having/_come, ˱it˲_/is/_finding being_unoccupied /having_been/_swept and /having_been/_adorned.
\v 45 Then ˱it˲_/is/_going and /is/_taking with itself seven other spirits more_evil \add than\add* itself, and /having/_come_in ˱it˲_/is/_dwelling there; and the last \add state\add* - ˱of˲_/the/_=> that <=_person /is/_becoming worse \add than\add* the first. Thus ˱it˲_will_be also - ˱to˲_> this - evil <_generation.”
\v 46 him still speaking ˱to˲_the crowds, behold, the mother and the brothers ˱of˲_him /had/_stood outside, seeking /to/_speak ˱to˲_him.
\v 47 And someone said ˱to˲_him, “Behold, the mother ˱of˲_you and the brothers ˱of˲_you /have/_stood outside seeking /to/_speak ˱to˲_you.”
\v 48 But he answering said ˱to˲_the \add one\add* speaking ˱to˲_him, “Who is the mother ˱of˲_me and who_all are the brothers ˱of˲_me?”
\v 49 And /having/_stretched_out the hand ˱of˲_him to the disciples ˱of˲_him ˱he˲_said, “Behold, the mother ˱of˲_me and the brothers ˱of˲_me.
\v 50 For whoever - /may/_do the will ˱of˲_the Father ˱of˲_me who \add is\add* in /the/_heavens, he is brother, and sister, and mother ˱of˲_me.”
\c 13
\v 1 in - that day, - \nd Jesus\nd* /having/_come_out ˱from˲_the house, /was/_sitting by the sea.
\v 2 And great crowds /were/_gathered_together to him, so_that him /having/_boarded into /a/_boat /to_be/_sitting, and all the crowd /had/_stood on the shore.
\v 3 And ˱he˲_spoke many \add things\add* ˱to˲_them in parables saying, “Behold, the \add one\add* sowing came_out ˱of˲_the \add time\add* /to/_sow.
\v 4 And in the \add time\add* /to_be/_sowing ˱of˲_him, some on_one_hand fell along the road, and the birds came and devoured them.
\v 5 On_the_other_hand others fell on the rocky \add places\add*, where ˱it˲_/was/_=> not <=_having much soil, and immediately ˱it˲_sprang_up because_of the not /to_be/_having depth ˱of˲_soil,
\v 6 but /the/_sun /having/_risen, ˱it˲_/was/_scorched and because_of that /to_be/_=> not <=_having root ˱it˲_/was/_withered.
\v 7 On_the_other_hand others fell on the thorns, and the thorns went_up and choked_ them _out.
\v 8 On_the_other_hand others fell on the - good soil, and /was/_giving fruit– some on_one_hand /a/_hundred, on_the_other_hand some sixty, on_the_other_hand some thirty.
\v 9 The \add one\add* having ears, /let_˱him˲_/be_hearing.”
\v 10 ¶ And the disciples /having/_approached said ˱to˲_him, “for_ Why _reason ˱you˲_/are/_speaking ˱to˲_them in parables?”
\v 11 And he answering said ˱to˲_them, “Because ˱to˲_you_all /has_been/_given /to/_know the mysteries ˱of˲_the Kingdom ˱of˲_the Heavens, but ˱to˲_those ˱it˲_/has_ not _been/_given.
\v 12 For whoever /is/_having, /will_be_being/_given ˱to˲_him and ˱he˲_/will_be_being/_in_abundance; but whoever /is/_=> not <=_having, even what ˱he˲_/is/_having /will_be_being/_taken_away from him.
\v 13 Because_of this ˱I˲_/am/_speaking in parables ˱to˲_them, because seeing ˱they˲_/are/_=> not <=_seeing, and hearing ˱they˲_/are/_=> not <=_hearing, nor /are/_˱they˲_understanding.
\v 14 And the prophecy ˱of˲_Isaiah /is_being/_fulfilled ˱to˲_them - saying, ‘˱with˲_hearing ˱you_all˲_/will_be/_hearing but by_no_means ˱you_all˲_/may/_=> not <=_understand, and seeing ˱you_all˲_/will_be/_seeing but by_no_means ˱you_all˲_/may/_=> not <=_perceive.
\v 15 For the heart - ˱of˲_> this <_people /was/_become_dull, and ˱they˲_> hardly <_heard ˱with˲_the ears, and ˱they˲_shut the eyes ˱of˲_them; lest ˱they˲_/may/_see ˱with˲_the eyes, and ˱they˲_/may/_hear ˱with˲_the ears, and ˱they˲_/may/_understand ˱with˲_the heart, and ˱they˲_/may/_return and ˱I˲_/will_be/_healing them.’
\v 16 But blessed \add are\add* the eyes ˱of˲_you_all because ˱they˲_/are/_seeing, and the ears ˱of˲_you_all because ˱they˲_/are/_hearing.
\v 17 For, truly ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all that many prophets and righteous \add men\add* desired /to/_see what ˱you_all˲_/are/_seeing, and ˱they˲_> not <_saw, and /to/_hear what ˱you_all˲_/are/_hearing, and ˱they˲_> not <_heard.
\v 18 ¶ Therefore you_all hear the parable ˱of˲_the \add one\add* /having/_sown.
\v 19 Everyone hearing the word ˱of˲_the kingdom and not understanding, the evil \add one\add* /is/_coming and /is/_snatching the \add one\add* /having_been/_sown in the heart ˱of˲_him. This is the \add one\add* /having_been/_sown by the road.
\v 20 And the \add one\add* /having_been/_sown on the rocky, this is the \add one\add* hearing the word and immediately receiving it with joy,
\v 21 and /is/_having no root in himself, but is temporary, but tribulation or persecution /having/_become because_of the word, immediately ˱he˲_/is_being/_stumbled.
\v 22 And the \add one\add* /having_been/_sown among the thorns, this is the \add one\add* hearing the word, and the worry - ˱of˲_age and the seduction - ˱of˲_riches /is/_choking the word, and ˱it˲_/is/_becoming unfruitful.
\v 23 And the \add one\add* /having_been/_sown on the good soil, this is the \add one\add* hearing the word and understanding, who indeed /is/_bearing_fruit and /is/_producing, some on_one_hand /a/_hundred, on_the_other_hand some sixty, on_the_other_hand some thirty.”
\v 24 ¶ ˱He˲_set_before ˱to˲_them another parable saying, the Kingdom ˱of˲_the Heavens “/Was/_likened, ˱to˲_/a/_man /having/_sown good seed in the field ˱of˲_him.
\v 25 But at the \add time\add* the people /to_be/_sleeping, the enemy ˱of˲_him came and sowed darnels among midst ˱of˲_the wheat and went_away.
\v 26 But when the grass sprouted and produced fruit, then the darnels /was/_seen also.
\v 27 And the slaves ˱of˲_the home_owner /having/_approached said ˱to˲_him, ‘Master, ˱you˲_> not <_sowed good seed in - your field? Therefore from_where ˱it˲_/is/_having darnels?’
\v 28 And he /was/_saying ˱to˲_them, ‘/An/_enemy man did this.’ And the slaves /are/_saying ˱to˲_him, ‘Therefore ˱you˲_/are/_wanting /having/_gone_away, /may/_˱we˲_gather them?’
\v 29 But he /is/_saying, ‘No, lest gathering the darnels, ˱you_all˲_/may/_uproot the wheat together_with them.
\v 30 Allow both /to_be_being/_grown_together until the harvest; and in /the/_time ˱of˲_the harvest ˱I˲_/will_be/_saying ˱to˲_the harvesters, “Gather first the darnels and bind them into bundles in_order that /to/_burn_up them, and gather_together the wheat into the barn ˱of˲_me.”’”
\v 31 ¶ Another parable ˱he˲_set_before ˱to˲_them saying, the Kingdom ˱of˲_the Heavens is “Similar ˱to˲_/a/_seed ˱of˲_mustard, which /a/_man /having/_taken sowed in the field ˱of˲_him;
\v 32 which on_one_hand ˱it˲_is smaller ˱of˲_all the seeds, on_the_other_hand whenever ˱it˲_/may_be/_grown is greater \add than\add* the garden_plants and /is/_becoming /a/_tree, so_that ‘the birds ˱of˲_the sky /to/_come and /to_be/_nesting in the branches ˱of˲_it’.”
\v 33 ¶ Another parable ˱he˲_spoke ˱to˲_them: the Kingdom ˱of˲_the Heavens is “Similar ˱to˲_leaven, which /a/_woman /having/_taken, hid_in in three satons ˱of˲_wheat_flour, until ˱of˲_which all /was/_leavened.”
\v 34 ¶ - \nd Jesus\nd* all these \add things\add* spoke in parables ˱to˲_the crowds, and ˱he˲_/was/_speaking nothing ˱to˲_them without /a/_parable;
\v 35 so_that the \add word\add* /may_be/_fulfilled /having_been/_spoken by the prophet saying, “˱I˲_/will_be/_opening_up the mouth ˱of˲_me in parables, ˱I˲_/will_be/_uttering \add things\add* /having_been/_hidden from /the/_foundation ˱of˲_/the/_world.”
\v 36 ¶ Then /having/_left the crowds, ˱he˲_came into the house. And the disciples ˱of˲_him approached ˱to˲_him saying, “Explain ˱to˲_us the parable ˱of˲_the darnels ˱of˲_the field.”
\v 37 And he answering said, “The \add one\add* sowing the good seed is the Son - ˱of˲_Man;
\v 38 and the field is the world; and the good seed, these are the sons ˱of˲_the kingdom; and the darnels are the sons ˱of˲_the evil \add one\add*,
\v 39 and the enemy \add is\add*, the \add one\add* /having/_sown them, is the devil; and the harvest is /the/_completion ˱of˲_/the/_age, and the harvesters are angels.
\v 40 Therefore as the darnels /is_being/_gathered and /is_being/_burned_up ˱in˲_fire, thus ˱it˲_will_be in the completion ˱of˲_the age.
\v 41 The Son - ˱of˲_Man /will_be/_sending_out the angels ˱of˲_him, and ˱they˲_/will_be/_gathering out_of the kingdom ˱of˲_him all the temptations and the \add ones\add* practicing - lawlessness,
\v 42 and ˱they˲_/will_be/_casting them into the furnace ˱of˲_the fire; there will_be - weeping and - gnashing - ˱of˲_teeth.
\v 43 Then ‘the righteous /will_be/_shining_forth as the sun’ in the kingdom ˱of˲_the Father ˱of˲_them. The \add one\add* having ears, /let_˱him˲_/be_hearing.
\v 44 the Kingdom ˱of˲_the Heavens is ¶ Similar ˱to˲_treasure /having_been/_hidden in the field, which /a/_man /having/_found hid, and from the joy ˱of˲_it /is/_going and /is/_selling all as_much_as ˱he˲_/is/_having, and /is/_buying - that field.
\v 45 ¶ Again the Kingdom ˱of˲_the Heavens is similar ˱to˲_/a/_=> merchant <=_man seeking beautiful pearls;
\v 46 and /having/_found one precious pearl /having/_gone_away, ˱he˲_/has/_sold all \add things\add* as_many_as ˱he˲_/was/_having, and bought it.
\v 47 ¶ Again the Kingdom ˱of˲_the Heavens is similar ˱to˲_/a/_dragnet /having_been/_cast into the sea and /having/_gathered_together of every kind;
\v 48 which when ˱it˲_/was/_filled, /having/_pulled_up on the shore and /having/_sat_down, ˱they˲_gathered the good into containers, and the bad ˱they˲_cast. out.
\v 49 Thus ˱it˲_will_be in the completion ˱of˲_the age; the angels /will_be/_coming_out, and /will_be/_setting_apart the evil from /the/_midst ˱of˲_the righteous,
\v 50 and ˱they˲_/will_be/_casting them into the furnace ˱of˲_the fire. There will_be - weeping and - gnashing - ˱of˲_teeth.
\v 51 ¶ ˱You_all˲_understood all these \add things\add*?” ˱They˲_/are/_saying ˱to˲_him, “Yes.”
\v 52 And he said ˱to˲_them, “Because_of this, every scribe /having_been/_discipled ˱in˲_the Kingdom ˱of˲_the Heavens is similar ˱to˲_/a/_man, /a/_home_owner, who /is/_sending_forth new \add things\add* and old \add things\add* out_of the treasure ˱of˲_him.”
\v 53 ¶ And ˱it˲_became when - \nd Jesus\nd* finished the these parables, ˱he˲_withdrew from_there.
\v 54 And /having/_come into the hometown ˱of˲_him, ˱he˲_/was/_teaching them in the synagogue ˱of˲_them, so_that them /to_be_being/_astonished and /to_be/_saying, “From_where ˱to˲_this \add man\add* - this wisdom and the miracles \add received\add*?
\v 55 Is this not the son ˱of˲_the carpenter? Not the mother ˱of˲_him /is_being/_called Mary, and the brothers ˱of˲_him, Jacobus, and Joseph, and Simon, and Judas?
\v 56 And are not the sisters ˱of˲_him all with us? Therefore from_where ˱to˲_this \add man\add* these \add things\add* all \add received\add*?”
\v 57 And ˱they˲_/were_being/_offended at him. But - \nd Jesus\nd* said ˱to˲_them, “/A/_prophet is not dishonorable, except - in the hometown and in the house ˱of˲_him.”
\v 58 And ˱he˲_> not <_did many miracles there, because_of the unbelief ˱of˲_them.
\c 14
\v 1 That at - time Herod the tetrarch heard the report ˱of˲_\nd Jesus\nd*,
\v 2 and ˱he˲_said ˱to˲_the servants ˱of˲_him, “This is John the Baptist; he /was/_raised from the dead, and because_of this the miracles /are/_working in him.”
\v 3 For - Herod /having/_apprehended - John, bound him and put_away \add him\add* in prison, because_of Herodias, the wife ˱of˲_Philip, the brother ˱of˲_him.
\v 4 For - John /was/_saying, ˱to˲_him “˱It˲_/is/_=> not <=_permitting ˱for˲_you /to_be/_having her.”
\v 5 And wanting /to/_kill_ him _off, ˱he˲_/was/_afraid the crowd, because ˱they˲_/were/_having him as /a/_prophet.
\v 6 But ˱for˲_/the/_birthday_celebrations - ˱of˲_Herod /having/_become, the daughter - ˱of˲_Herodias danced in the midst and brought_pleasure - ˱to˲_Herod,
\v 7 whence with /an/_oath, ˱he˲_promised /to/_give ˱to˲_her whatever - ˱she˲_/may/_request.
\v 8 And - /having_been/_urged_on by the mother ˱of˲_her, “Give ˱to˲_me”, ˱she˲_/is/_saying, “here on /a/_platter, the head ˱of˲_John the Baptist.”
\v 9 And the king /was/_sorrowed but because_of the oaths and the \add ones\add* reclining, ˱he˲_commanded \add it\add* /to_be/_given.
\v 10 And /having/_sent, ˱he˲_beheaded John in the prison.
\v 11 And the head ˱of˲_him /was/_brought on /a/_platter, and ˱it˲_/was/_given ˱to˲_the little_girl, and ˱she˲_brought \add it\add* ˱to˲_the mother ˱of˲_her.
\v 12 And /having/_approached, the disciples ˱of˲_him took_away the corpse and buried him, and /having/_come, ˱they˲_reported - ˱to˲_\nd Jesus\nd*.
\v 13 ¶ And - \nd Jesus\nd* /having/_heard, withdrew from_there by boat to /a/_desolate place by himself. And /having/_heard \add it\add*, the crowds followed ˱after˲_him on_foot from the cities.
\v 14 And /having/_come_out, ˱he˲_saw /a/_=> great <=_crowd, and ˱he˲_/was/_feeling_compassion to them and healed the sick ˱of˲_them.
\v 15 And evening /having/_become, the disciples approached ˱to˲_him saying, “The place is desolate and the hour already passed_by; send_away the crowds, in_order_that /having/_gone_away into the villages, ˱they˲_/may/_buy foods ˱for˲_themselves.”
\v 16 But - \nd Jesus\nd* said ˱to˲_them, “˱They˲_/are/_having no need /to/_go_away. You_all give \add something\add* ˱to˲_them /to/_eat.”
\v 17 And they /are/_saying ˱to˲_him, “˱We˲_/are/_=> not <=_having \add anything\add* here, except - five loaves and two fishes.”
\v 18 And he said, “/Be/_bringing them here ˱to˲_me.”
\v 19 And /having/_commanded the crowds /to_be/_sat_down on the grass, and /having/_taken the five loaves and the two fishes, /having/_looked_up to the sky, ˱he˲_blessed and /having/_broke, gave the loaves ˱to˲_the disciples, and the disciples ˱to˲_the crowds.
\v 20 And all ate and /were/_satisfied, and ˱they˲_took_up the \add part\add* being_leftover ˱of˲_the fragments twelve, baskets full.
\v 21 And the \add ones\add* eating were about five_thousand men, apart_from women and little_children.
\v 22 ¶ And immediately ˱he˲_compelled the disciples /to/_board into the boat, and /to_be/_going_before him to the \add side\add* across, until ˱of˲_which ˱he˲_/may/_send_away the crowds.
\v 23 And /having/_sent_away the crowds, ˱he˲_went_up on the mountain by himself /to/_pray. And evening /having/_become, ˱he˲_was /the/_only \add one\add* there.
\v 24 And the boat was now /the/_midst the ˱of˲_/the/_sea, /being/_tormented by the waves, for the wind was contrary.
\v 25 And ˱in˲_/the/_fourth watch ˱of˲_the night, ˱he˲_came to them walking on the sea.
\v 26 And the disciples /having/_seen, him walking on the sea, /were/_disturbed saying, - “˱It˲_is /a/_ghost”, and ˱they˲_cried_out in - fear.
\v 27 But immediately - \nd Jesus\nd* spoke ˱to˲_them saying, “/Be/_having_courage, I am \add here\add*, /be/_=> not <=_fearing.”
\v 28 ¶ And - Peter answering ˱to˲_him, said, “\nd Lord\nd*, if you are, command me /to/_come to you on the waters.”
\v 29 And he said, “Come.” And Peter /having/_come_down from the boat, walked on the waters and came to - \nd Jesus\nd*.
\v 30 But seeing the mighty wind, ˱he˲_/was/_afraid and /having/_begun /to_be_being/_sunk, ˱he˲_cried_out saying, “\nd Lord\nd*, save me.”
\v 31 And immediately - \nd Jesus\nd* /having/_stretched_out his hand, took_hold ˱of˲_him and /is/_saying ˱to˲_him, “Little_faith \add one\add*, for why ˱you˲_doubted?”
\v 32 And ˱of˲_them /having/_gone_up into the boat, the wind died_down.
\v 33 And the \add ones\add* in the boat worshipped ˱before˲_him saying, “Truly ˱you˲_are /the/_Son ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*!”
\v 34 ¶ And /having/_crossed_over, ˱they˲_came to the land to Gennesaret.
\v 35 And /having/_recognized him, the men - ˱of˲_> that <_place sent_out to all - that surrounding_region, and brought ˱to˲_him all the \add ones\add* being sickly,
\v 36 and ˱they˲_/were/_begging him that ˱they˲_/may/_=> only <=_touch ˱against˲_the fringe ˱of˲_the garment ˱of˲_him; and as_many_as touched /were/_cured.
\c 15
\v 1 ¶ Then Pharisees and scribes from Jerusalem /are/_approaching - ˱to˲_\nd Jesus\nd*, saying,
\v 2 “for_ Why _reason the disciples ˱of˲_you /are/_breaking_from the tradition ˱of˲_the elders? For ˱they˲_/are/_=> not <=_washing their hands whenever ˱they˲_/may_be/_eating bread.”
\v 3 And he answering said ˱to˲_them, “for_ Why _reason also you_all /are/_breaking_from the commandment - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd* because_of the tradition ˱of˲_you_all?
\v 4 For - \nd God\nd* commanded saying, ‘/be/_honoring the father and the mother’, and, ‘the \add one\add* speaking_evil ˱of˲_father or mother, /let_be/_dying ˱in˲_death.’
\v 5 But you_all /are/_saying, ‘Whoever - /may/_say ˱to˲_the father or the mother, whatever - ˱you˲_/may_be/_benefited by me”, “/A/_gift”,
\v 6 by_no_means ˱he˲_/will_ not _be/_honoring the father ˱of˲_him.’ And ˱you_all˲_annulled the word - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd* because_of the tradition ˱of˲_you_all.
\v 7 Hypocrites! Isaiah rightly prophesied concerning you_all saying,
\v 8 ‘- this people /is/_honoring me the lips, and the heart ˱of˲_them /is/_being_away far_away from me.
\v 9 And ˱they˲_/are/_worshipping me uselessly, teaching teachings ˱as˲_/the/_commandments ˱of˲_humans.’”
\v 10 ¶ And /having/_called_to the crowd, ˱he˲_said ˱to˲_them, “/Be/_hearing and /be/_understanding!
\v 11 Not the \add thing\add* coming_in into the mouth /is/_defiling the person, but the \add thing\add* going_out out_of the mouth, this /is/_defiling the person.”
\v 12 Then the disciples /having/_approached /are/_saying ˱to˲_him, “˱You˲_/have/_known that the Pharisees /having/_heard the statement /were/_offended?”
\v 13 But he answering said, “Every plant that the the heavenly Father ˱of˲_me not planted /will_be_being/_uprooted.
\v 14 Leave them; ˱they˲_are blind guides and, if blind /may_be/_guiding blind, both /will_be/_falling into /a/_pit.”
\v 15 And - Peter answering said ˱to˲_him, “Interpret the parable ˱to˲_us.”
\v 16 And he said, “Are you_all even still unintelligent?
\v 17 /are/_˱you_all˲_understanding Not_yet that everything - entering_in into the mouth, /is/_entering into the stomach, and /is_being/_cast_out to /the/_latrine?
\v 18 But the \add things\add* going_out out_of the mouth, /is/_coming_out out_of the heart, and_those /is/_defiling the person.
\v 19 For out_of the heart /are/_coming_out evil speculations, murders, adulteries, sexual_immorality, thefts, false_witnesses, slander.
\v 20 These is the \add things\add* defiling the person, but the \add one\add* /to/_eat ˱with˲_unwashed hands, /is/_=> not <=_defiling the person.”
\v 21 ¶ And - \nd Jesus\nd* /having/_come_out from_there, withdrew to the districts ˱of˲_Tyre and Sidon.
\v 22 And behold, /a/_=> Canaanite <=_woman /having/_come_out from the those regions, /was/_crying_out saying, “Show_mercy ˱to˲_me, \nd Lord\nd*, Son ˱of˲_David; the daughter ˱of˲_me /is/_being_ sickly _demon_possessed.”
\v 23 But he not answered /a/_word ˱to˲_her. And the disciples ˱of˲_him /having/_approached, /were/_asking him saying, “send_ Her _away, because ˱she˲_/is/_crying_out behind us.”
\v 24 But he answering said, “˱I˲_/was/_=> not <=_sent_out except - to the sheep - /having/_lost ˱of˲_/the/_house ˱of˲_Israel.”
\v 25 But she /having/_come /was/_kneeling ˱to˲_him saying, “\nd Lord\nd*, /be/_giving_help ˱to˲_me!”
\v 26 And he answering said, ˱it˲_is “Not good /to/_take the bread ˱of˲_the children and /to/_cast \add it\add* ˱to˲_the little_dogs.”
\v 27 But she said, “Yes, \nd Lord\nd*, for even the little_dogs /is/_eating of the little_crumbs - falling from the table ˱of˲_the masters ˱of˲_them.”
\v 28 Then - \nd Jesus\nd* answering said ˱to˲_her, “O woman, great \add is\add* the faith ˱of˲_you; /let_˱it˲_/be_become ˱to˲_you as ˱you˲_/are/_wanting.” And the daughter ˱of˲_her /was/_healed from - that hour.
\v 29 ¶ And - \nd Jesus\nd* /having/_departed from_there, came along the sea - ˱of˲_Galilee, and /having/_gone_up on the mountain, ˱he˲_/was/_sitting there.
\v 30 And great crowds approached ˱to˲_him, having with themselves lame, maimed, blind, mute, and many others, and ˱they˲_laid_ them _down before the feet ˱of˲_him, and ˱he˲_healed them;
\v 31 so_that the crowds /to/_marvel, seeing mute speaking, maimed healthy, and lame walking, and blind seeing; and ˱they˲_glorified the \nd God\nd* ˱of˲_Israel.
\v 32 ¶ And - \nd Jesus\nd* /having/_called_to the disciples ˱of˲_him said, “˱I˲_/am/_feeling_compassion for the crowd, because already ˱they˲_/are/_remaining ˱with˲_me three days, and ˱they˲_/are/_=> not <=_having anything ˱they˲_/may/_eat; and ˱I˲_/am/_=> not <=_willing /to/_send_away them hungry, lest ˱they˲_/may_be/_exhausted on the way.”
\v 33 And the disciples /are/_saying ˱to˲_him, “From_where ˱to˲_us in /a/_desert, so_many loaves so_as /to/_satisfy so_much crowd?”
\v 34 And - \nd Jesus\nd* /is/_saying ˱to˲_them, “How_many loaves /are/_˱you_all˲_having?” And they said, “Seven, and /a/_few little_fishes.”
\v 35 And /having/_commanded ˱to˲_the crowd /to/_sit_down on the ground,
\v 36 ˱he˲_took the seven loaves and the fishes, and /having/_given_thanks ˱he˲_broke \add them\add* and /was/_giving \add them\add* ˱to˲_the disciples, and the disciples ˱to˲_the crowds.
\v 37 And all ate and /were/_satisfied, and ˱they˲_took_up seven fragments, the \add part\add* being_leftover ˱of˲_the, baskets full.
\v 38 And the \add ones\add* eating were four_thousand men, apart_from women and little_children.
\v 39 And /having/_sent_away the crowds, ˱he˲_boarded into the boat and came to the regions ˱of˲_Magadan.
\c 16
\v 1 ¶ And the Pharisees and Sadducees /having/_approached, tempting \add him\add* ˱they˲_asked him ˱for˲_/a/_sign out_of the sky /to/_show ˱to˲_them.
\v 2 But he answering said ˱to˲_them,
\v 3
\v 4 /a/_=> “evil and adulterous <=_generation /is/_seeking_after /a/_sign, and /a/_sign /will_ not _be_being/_given ˱to˲_it, except - the sign ˱of˲_Jonah.” And /having/_left them ˱he˲_went_away.
\v 5 ¶ And the disciples /having/_come to the \add side\add* across, ˱they˲_forgot /to/_take loaves.
\v 6 And - \nd Jesus\nd* said ˱to˲_them, “/Be/_watching and /be/_taking_heed of the leaven ˱of˲_the Pharisees and Sadducees.”
\v 7 And they /were/_reasoning among themselves saying, - ˱we˲_> not <_took “Loaves.”
\v 8 But - \nd Jesus\nd* /having/_known, said, “Why /are/_˱you_all˲_reasoning among yourselves, little_faith \add ones\add*, because ˱you_all˲_/are/_=> not <=_having loaves?
\v 9 ˱You_all˲_/are/_=> not_yet <=_understanding, neither /are/_˱you_all˲_remembering the five loaves ˱of˲_the five_thousand, and how_many baskets ˱you_all˲_took?
\v 10 Nor the seven loaves ˱of˲_the four_thousand, and how_many baskets ˱you_all˲_took?
\v 11 How ˱you_all˲_/are/_=> not <=_understanding that ˱I˲_spoke ˱to˲_you_all not concerning /the/_loaves? And /be/_taking_heed of the leaven ˱of˲_the Pharisees and Sadducees.”
\v 12 Then ˱they˲_understood that ˱he˲_> not <_said /to_be/_taking_heed of the leaven ˱of˲_the loaves, but of the teaching ˱of˲_the Pharisees and Sadducees.
\v 13 ¶ And ¶ - \nd Jesus\nd* /having/_come into the districts ˱of˲_Caesarea - Philippi, /was/_asking the disciples ˱of˲_him saying, “Whom /are/_=> the people <=_saying the Son - ˱of˲_Man to_be?”
\v 14 And they said, “The \add ones\add* on_one_hand John the Baptist, on_the_other_hand others Elijah, on_the_other_hand others Jeremiah or one ˱of˲_the prophets.”
\v 15 ˱He˲_/is/_saying ˱to˲_them, “But you_all, whom /are/_saying me to_be?”
\v 16 And Simon Peter answering said, “You are the \nd Messiah\nd*, the Son ˱of˲_the - living \nd God\nd*.”
\v 17 And - \nd Jesus\nd* answering said ˱to˲_him, “˱You˲_are blessed, Simon Barjonah, because flesh and blood not ˱it˲_revealed ˱to˲_you, but the Father ˱of˲_me, who \add is\add* in the heavens.
\v 18 And also_I /am/_saying ˱to˲_you that you are Peter, and on this - rock ˱I˲_/will_be/_building the assembly ˱of˲_me, and /the/_gates ˱of˲_Hades /will_ not _be/_prevailing ˱against˲_it.
\v 19 ˱I˲_/will_be/_giving the keys ˱of˲_the Kingdom ˱of˲_the Heavens, ˱to˲_you, and whatever - ˱you˲_/may/_bind on the earth, will_be /having_been/_bound in the heavens, and whatever - ˱you˲_/may/_loose on the earth, will_be /having_been/_loosed in the heavens.”
\v 20 Then ˱he˲_instructed ˱to˲_the disciples that ˱they˲_/may/_say ˱to˲_no_one that he is the \nd Messiah\nd*.
\v 21 ¶ From then - \nd Jesus\nd* \nd Christ\nd* began /to_be/_showing ˱to˲_the disciples ˱of˲_him that ˱it˲_/is/_fitting him /to/_go_away to Jerusalem, and /to/_suffer many \add things\add* from the elders, and chief_priests, and scribes, and /to_be/_killed_off and ˱on˲_the third day /to_be/_raised.
\v 22 And - Peter /having/_taken_aside him, ˱he˲_began /to_be/_giving_rebuke ˱to˲_him saying, “Merciful \add be\add* ˱to˲_you, \nd Lord\nd*; by_no_means this will_ not _be ˱to˲_you.”
\v 23 But he /having_been/_turned said - ˱to˲_Peter, “/Be/_going behind me, Satan! ˱You˲_are /a/_temptation ˱of˲_me, because ˱you˲_/are/_=> not <=_thinking the \add things\add* - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*, but the \add things\add* - ˱of˲_humans.”
\v 24 ¶ Then - \nd Jesus\nd* said ˱to˲_the disciples ˱of˲_him, “If anyone /is/_wanting /to/_come after me, ˱him˲_/let/_renounce himself, and ˱him˲_/let/_take_up the cross ˱of˲_him, and ˱him˲_/let_be/_following ˱after˲_me.
\v 25 For whoever - /may_be/_wanting /to/_save the life ˱of˲_him, /will_be/_losing it; but whoever - /may/_lose the life ˱of˲_him on_account me, /will_be/_finding it.
\v 26 For what /will_ /a/_person _be_being/_benefited, if whole the world ˱he˲_/may/_gain, but the soul ˱of˲_him /may_be/_lost? Or what /will_ /a/_person _be/_giving ˱as˲_/an/_exchange ˱for˲_the soul ˱of˲_him?
\v 27 For the Son - ˱of˲_Man /is/_going /to_be/_coming in the glory ˱of˲_the Father ˱of˲_him with the angels ˱of˲_him, and ‘then ˱he˲_/will_be/_giving_back ˱to˲_each according_to the practice ˱of˲_him’.
\v 28 Truly, ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all that are some ˱of˲_the \add ones\add* /having/_stood here who by_no_means /may/_=> not <=_taste ˱of˲_death, until - ˱they˲_/may/_see the Son - ˱of˲_Man coming in the kingdom ˱of˲_him.”
\c 17
\v 1 ¶ And after six days, - \nd Jesus\nd* /is/_taking - Peter, and Jacobus, and John, the brother ˱of˲_him, and ˱he˲_/is/_bringing_up them into /a/_=> high <=_mountain by themselves.
\v 2 And ˱he˲_/was/_transformed before them, and the face ˱of˲_him shined as the sun, and the clothes ˱of˲_him became white as the light.
\v 3 And behold, Moses and Elijah /was/_seen ˱to˲_them conversing_with with him.
\v 4 And - Peter answering, said - ˱to˲_\nd Jesus\nd*, “\nd Lord\nd*, ˱it˲_is good us to_be here. If ˱you˲_/are/_wanting, ˱I˲_/will_be/_making three tents here, one ˱for˲_you, and one ˱for˲_Moses, and one ˱for˲_Elijah.”
\v 5 Him still speaking, behold, /a/_=> bright <=_cloud overshadowed them, and behold, /a/_voice out_of the cloud saying, “This is the Son ˱of˲_me, the beloved in whom ˱I˲_took_pleasure; /be/_hearing ˱from˲_him!”
\v 6 And /having/_heard \add it\add*, the disciples fell on face ˱of˲_them and ˱they˲_/were/_=> exceedingly <=_afraid.
\v 7 And - \nd Jesus\nd* approached and /having/_touched ˱against˲_them ˱he˲_said, “/Be/_raised and /be/_=> not <=_fearing.”
\v 8 And /having/_lifted_up the eyes ˱of˲_them, ˱they˲_saw no_one except only \nd Jesus\nd* - himself.
\v 9 ¶ And them coming_down from the mountain, - \nd Jesus\nd* commanded ˱to˲_them saying, ˱you_all˲_/may/_tell the vision “˱To˲_no_one, until ˱of˲_which the Son - ˱of˲_Man /may/_rise_up from /the/_dead.”
\v 10 And the disciples ˱of˲_him asked him saying, “Why therefore /are/_=> the scribes <=_saying that Elijah /to/_pass_through first?”
\v 11 And he answering said, “Elijah on_one_hand /is/_coming and /will_be/_restoring all \add things\add*;
\v 12 on_the_other_hand ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all that Elijah already came and ˱they˲_> not <_knew him, but ˱they˲_did with him as_much_as ˱they˲_wanted. Thus also the Son - ˱of˲_Man /is/_going /to_be/_suffering by them.”
\v 13 Then the disciples understood that ˱he˲_spoke ˱to˲_them concerning John the Baptist.
\v 14 ¶ And ˱of˲_/having/_come to the crowd, /a/_man approached ˱to˲_him kneeling ˱before˲_him
\v 15 and saying, “\nd Lord\nd*, show_mercy ˱to˲_the son ˱of˲_me, because ˱he˲_/is/_being_epileptic and /is/_having sickly, for often ˱he˲_/is/_falling into the fire, and often into the water.
\v 16 And ˱I˲_brought him ˱to˲_the disciples ˱of˲_you, and ˱they˲_/were/_=> not <=_able /to/_heal him.”
\v 17 And - \nd Jesus\nd* answering said, “O unbelieving generation and /having_been/_perverted, until when ˱I˲_will_be with you_all? Until when /will_˱I˲_/be_tolerating ˱of˲_you_all? /Be/_bringing him here ˱to˲_me.”
\v 18 And - \nd Jesus\nd* gave_rebuke ˱to˲_it, and the demon came_out from him, and the boy /was/_healed from - that hour.
\v 19 Then the disciples /having/_approached - ˱to˲_\nd Jesus\nd* by themselves said, “for_ Why _reason we /were/_=> not <=_able /to/_cast_ it _out?”
\v 20 And he /is/_saying ˱to˲_them, “Because_of the little_faith ˱of˲_you_all. For, truly ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all, if ˱you_all˲_/may_be/_having faith as /a/_seed ˱of˲_mustard, ˱you_all˲_/will_be/_saying - ˱to˲_> this <_mountain, ‘Move ˱from˲_here ˱to˲_there’, and ˱it˲_/will_be/_moving, and nothing /will_be/_unattaining ˱for˲_you_all.”
\v 21
\v 22 ¶ And them /being/_gathered in - Galilee, - \nd Jesus\nd* said ˱to˲_them, the Son - ˱of˲_Man “/Is/_going /to_be_being/_given_over into /the/_hands ˱of˲_people,
\v 23 and ˱they˲_/will_be/_killing_ him _off, and ˱on˲_the third day ˱he˲_/will_be_being/_raised.” And ˱they˲_/were/_=> exceedingly <=_sorrowed.
\v 24 ¶ And them /having/_come to Capernaum, the \add ones\add* receiving the two_drachmas approached - ˱to˲_Peter and said, “The teacher ˱of˲_you_all /is/_=> not <=_paying the two_drachmas?”
\v 25 ˱He˲_/is/_saying, “Yes.” And /having/_come into the house, - \nd Jesus\nd* preceded him saying, “What /is/_supposing ˱to˲_you, Simon? The kings ˱of˲_the earth, /are/_receiving revenues from whom_all or poll_tax? From the sons ˱of˲_them or from - strangers?”
\v 26 /is/_saying ˱to˲_him - Peter “From the strangers.” And ˱he˲_/having/_said, “From the strangers”, - \nd Jesus\nd* /was/_saying ˱to˲_him, “Consequently surely /the/_free \add ones\add* are the sons.
\v 27 But in_order_that ˱we˲_/may/_=> not <=_offend them, /having_been/_gone to sea, cast /a/_fish_hook and take_up the first fish /having/_gone_up, and /having/_opened_up the mouth ˱of˲_it, ˱you˲_/will_be/_finding /a/_stater; /having/_taken that, give ˱to˲_them for me and you.”
\c 18
\v 1 That in - hour the disciples approached - ˱to˲_\nd Jesus\nd* saying, “Who consequently is /the/_greater in the Kingdom ˱of˲_the Heavens?”
\v 2 And /having/_called_to /a/_little_child, ˱he˲_stood it in midst ˱of˲_them
\v 3 and said, “Truly, ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all, if ˱you_all˲_/may_ not _be/_turned and /may/_become as the little_children, by_no_means ˱you_all˲_/may/_=> not <=_come_in into the Kingdom ˱of˲_the Heavens.
\v 4 Therefore whoever /will_be/_humbling himself as the this little_child, this \add one\add* is the greater in the Kingdom ˱of˲_the Heavens.
\v 5 And whoever - /may/_receive one such little_child in the name ˱of˲_me, /is/_receiving me.
\v 6 ¶ But whoever - /may/_stumble one - ˱of˲_> these <_little \add ones\add* - believing in me, ˱it˲_/is/_benefitting ˱for˲_him that /a/_=> heavy <=_millstone /may_be/_hanged around the neck ˱of˲_him, and /may_be/_sunk in the depth ˱of˲_the sea.
\v 7 Woe ˱to˲_the world because_of the temptations! For ˱it˲_is necessity the temptations /to/_come, however woe ˱to˲_the that person by whom the temptation /is/_coming!
\v 8 ¶ And if the hand ˱of˲_you or the foot ˱of˲_you /is/_stumbling you, cut_off it and cast \add it\add* from you; ˱it˲_is better ˱for˲_you /to/_come_in into - life maimed or lame, than having two two hands or feet, /to_be/_cast into the - eternal fire.
\v 9 And if the eye ˱of˲_you /is/_stumbling you, pluck_out it and cast \add it\add* from you; ˱it˲_is better ˱for˲_you /to/_come_in into - life one-eyed, than /to_be/_cast into the Gehenna - ˱of˲_fire having two eyes.
\v 10 ¶ /Be/_seeing ˱you_all˲_/may/_=> not <=_despise ˱of˲_one - ˱of˲_> these <_little \add ones\add*, for ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all that the angels ˱of˲_them in /the/_heavens, through all \add time\add* /are/_seeing the face ˱of˲_the Father ˱of˲_me, who \add is\add* in /the/_heavens.
\v 11
\v 12 what /is/_˱it˲_supposing ˱to˲_you_all? If ˱it˲_/may/_become ˱to˲_/a/_certain man /a/_hundred sheep, and one of them /may_be/_strayed, /having_ not the ninety nine _/_left on the mountains, and /having_been/_gone /is/_seeking the \add sheep\add* /being/_strayed?
\v 13 And if ˱he˲_/may/_become /to/_find it, truly, ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all that ˱he˲_/is/_rejoicing over it more than over the ninety nine - not /having_been/_strayed.
\v 14 Thus not is /the/_will before the Father ˱of˲_you_all, who \add is\add* in /the/_heavens, that /may/_perish one - ˱of˲_> these <_little \add ones\add*.
\v 15 ¶ And if the brother ˱of˲_you /may/_sin, /be/_going rebuke him between you and him only. If ˱he˲_/may/_hear ˱from˲_you, ˱you˲_gained the brother ˱of˲_you.
\v 16 But if ˱he˲_/may/_=> not <=_hear, take one or two more, with you, in_order_that ‘on /the/_mouth ˱of˲_two or three witnesses, every word /may_be/_established’.
\v 17 And if ˱he˲_/may/_refuse_to_hear ˱from˲_them, tell ˱to˲_the assembly. And if ˱he˲_/may/_=> also <=_refuse_to_hear ˱from˲_the assembly, ˱him˲_let_be ˱to˲_you as the pagan and the tax_collector.
\v 18 Truly, ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all, as_much_as - ˱you_all˲_/may/_bind on the earth, will_be /having_been/_bound in heaven, and as_much_as - ˱you_all˲_/may/_loose on the earth, will_be /having_been/_loosed in heaven.
\v 19 Again truly, ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all that if two of you_all on the earth /may/_agree_together concerning any matter, ˱of˲_whatever - ˱they˲_/may/_request, ˱it˲_/will_be/_becoming ˱for˲_them by the Father ˱of˲_me, who \add is\add* in /the/_heavens.
\v 20 For where are two or three /having_been/_gathered_together in the my name, there ˱I˲_am in /the/_midst ˱of˲_them.”
\v 21 ¶ Then - Peter /having/_approached, said ˱to˲_him, “\nd Lord\nd*, how_often /will_ the brother ˱of˲_me _be/_sinning against me, and ˱I˲_/will_be/_forgiving ˱to˲_him? Up_to seven_times?”
\v 22 - \nd Jesus\nd* /is/_saying ˱to˲_him, “˱I˲_/am/_=> not <=_saying ˱to˲_you up_to seven_times, but up_to seventy_times seven!
\v 23 ¶ Because_of this the Kingdom ˱of˲_the Heavens /was/_likened ˱to˲_/a/_man /a/_king, who wanted /to/_settle_accounts account with the slaves ˱of˲_him.
\v 24 And ˱of˲_him /having/_begun /to_be/_settling_accounts, one ˱of˲_ten_thousand /a/_debtor talents /was/_brought. ˱to˲_him.
\v 25 But ˱of˲_him not having \add means\add* /to/_give_back, the master commanded him /to_be/_sold, and the wife, and the children, and all \add things\add* as_many_as /was/_having, and \add payment\add* /to_be/_given_back.
\v 26 Therefore the slave /having/_fallen /was/_kneeling ˱to˲_him saying, ‘Master, be_patient with me, and ˱I˲_/will_be/_giving_ all _back ˱to˲_you.’
\v 27 And the master /having_been/_feeling_compassion, - ˱of˲_> that <_slave sent_ him _away, and ˱he˲_forgave the loan ˱to˲_him.
\v 28 But - that slave /having/_come_out, found one ˱of˲_the fellow-slaves ˱of˲_him, who /was/_owing /a/_hundred denarii ˱to˲_him, and /having/_apprehended him ˱he˲_/was/_strangling \add him\add* saying, ‘Give_back if anything ˱you˲_/are/_owing.’
\v 29 Therefore the fellow-slave ˱of˲_him /having/_fallen, /was/_imploring him saying, ‘Be_patient with me, and ˱I˲_/will_be/_giving_back ˱to˲_you.’
\v 30 And - ˱he˲_/was/_=> not <=_willing, but /having/_gone_away, ˱he˲_cast him into prison, until ˱he˲_/may/_give_back the \add thing\add* /being/_owed.
\v 31 therefore the fellow-slaves ˱of˲_him /Having/_seen the \add things\add* /having/_become, ˱they˲_/were/_=> exceedingly <=_sorrowed, and /having/_come ˱they˲_explained ˱to˲_the master ˱of˲_themselves all the \add things\add* /having/_become.
\v 32 Then the master ˱of˲_him /having/_called_to him /is/_saying ˱to˲_him, ‘Evil slave, that all - obligation ˱I˲_forgave ˱to˲_you, because ˱you˲_implored me.
\v 33 Not /was/_˱it˲_fitting you also /to/_show_mercy ˱to˲_the fellow-slave ˱of˲_you, as also_I shown_mercy ˱to˲_you?’
\v 34 And the master ˱of˲_him /having_been/_angered, gave_ him _over ˱to˲_the tormentors, until ˱of˲_which ˱he˲_/may/_give_back all - /being/_owed. ˱To˲_him.
\v 35 Thus also the - heavenly Father ˱of˲_me /will_be/_doing ˱to˲_you_all, if ˱you_all˲_/may/_=> not <=_forgive each ˱to˲_the brother ˱of˲_him from the hearts ˱of˲_you_all.”
\c 19
\v 1 ¶ And ˱it˲_became, when - \nd Jesus\nd* finished - these words, ˱he˲_withdrew from - Galilee and came to the regions - ˱of˲_Judea beyond the Jordan.
\v 2 And great crowds followed ˱after˲_him, and ˱he˲_healed them there.
\v 3 ¶ And /the/_Pharisees approached ˱to˲_him, testing him and saying, “- /is/_˱it˲_permitting /to/_send_away the wife ˱of˲_him according_to any cause?”
\v 4 And which answering ˱he˲_said, “˱You_all˲_> not <_read that he /having/_made \add them\add* from beginning, ‘made them male and female,’?
\v 5 And ˱he˲_said, ‘on_account ˱of˲_this /a/_man /will_be/_leaving his father and his mother, and /will_be_being/_joined_together ˱with˲_the wife ˱of˲_him, and the two will_be into one flesh’?
\v 6 So_that ˱they˲_> no_longer <_are two, but one flesh. Therefore what - \nd God\nd* joined_together, /let_ man not _be/_separating.”
\v 7 ˱They˲_/are/_saying ˱to˲_him, “Therefore why Moses commanded ‘/to/_give /a/_scroll ˱of˲_divorce and /to/_send_ her _away’?”
\v 8 ˱He˲_/is/_saying ˱to˲_them, - for the hard_heart ˱of˲_you_all “Moses, permitted ˱to˲_you_all /to/_send_away the wives ˱of˲_you_all, but from /the/_beginning ˱it˲_/has/_=> not <=_become thus.
\v 9 And ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all that whoever - /may/_send_away the wife ˱of˲_him - for sexual_immorality, /may/_marry another, /is/_causing_adultery. And the \add one\add* /having_been/_sent_away marrying /is/_causing_adultery.”
\v 10 ¶ The Disciples /are/_saying ˱to˲_him, “If thus is the cause ˱of˲_the husband with the wife, ˱it˲_/is/_=> not <=_benefitting /to/_marry.”
\v 11 But he said ˱to˲_them, “Not all /are/_accepting - this statement, but \add those\add* ˱to˲_whom ˱it˲_/has_been/_given.
\v 12 For ˱there˲_are eunuchs, who /were/_born thus from womb ˱of˲_mother, and ˱there˲_are eunuchs who /were/_castrated by - people, and ˱there˲_are eunuchs who castrated themselves because_of the Kingdom ˱of˲_the Heavens. The \add one\add* being_able /to_be/_accepting \add it\add*, ˱him˲_/let_be/_accepting \add it\add*.”
\v 13 ¶ Then little_children /were/_brought ˱to˲_him, in_order_that ˱he˲_/may/_lay_on his hands ˱on˲_them and ˱he˲_/may/_pray; and the disciples gave_rebuke ˱to˲_them.
\v 14 But - \nd Jesus\nd* said, ˱to˲_them, “Allow the little_children and not /be/_forbidding them /to/_come to me, for the Kingdom ˱of˲_the Heavens is - ˱of˲_such \add children\add*.”
\v 15 And /having/_laid_on his hands ˱on˲_them, ˱he˲_/was/_gone from_there.
\v 16 ¶ And behold, one /having/_approached ˱to˲_him said, “Teacher, what good /may/_˱I˲_do, in_order_that ˱I˲_/may/_have eternal life?”
\v 17 And he said ˱to˲_him, “Why /are/_˱you˲_asking me about the good? One is - good. But if ˱you˲_/are/_wanting into - life /to/_come_in, /be/_keeping the commandments.”
\v 18 ˱He˲_/is/_saying ˱to˲_him, “Which \add ones\add*?” And - \nd Jesus\nd* said, - “˱you˲_/will_ not _be/_murdering, ˱you˲_/will_ not _be/_committing_adultery, ˱you˲_/will_ not _be/_stealing, ˱you˲_/will_ not _be/_giving_false_testimony”,
\v 19 “/be/_honoring your father and your mother”, and, “˱you˲_/will_be/_loving the neighbor ˱of˲_you as yourself.”
\v 20 The Young_man /is/_saying ˱to˲_him, ˱I˲_kept all These \add things\add*; what /am/_˱I˲_lacking still?”
\v 21 - \nd Jesus\nd* /Was/_saying ˱to˲_him, “If ˱you˲_/are/_wanting to_be perfect, /be/_going sell the \add things\add* possessing ˱of˲_you, and give ˱to˲_/the/_poor, and ˱you˲_/will_be/_having treasure in /the/_heavens, and come, /be/_following ˱after˲_me.”
\v 22 But the young_man /having/_heard, the statement, ˱he˲_went_away /being/_sorrowed, for ˱he˲_was having many properties.
\v 23 ¶ And - \nd Jesus\nd* said ˱to˲_the disciples ˱of˲_him, “Truly, ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all that /a/_rich \add one\add* /will_be/_coming_in into the Kingdom ˱of˲_the Heavens difficultly.
\v 24 And again ˱I˲_/am/_telling ˱to˲_you_all, ˱it˲_is easier ˱for˲_/a/_camel /to/_pass_through through /the/_eye ˱of˲_/a/_needle than /a/_rich \add one\add* /to/_come_in into the Kingdom - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*.”
\v 25 And the disciples /having/_heard, /were_being/_=> exceedingly <=_astonished saying, “Who consequently /is/_able /to_be/_saved?”
\v 26 And - \nd Jesus\nd* /having/_focused_in said ˱to˲_them, “With humans this is impossible, but with \nd God\nd* all \add things\add* possible.”
\v 27 ¶ Then - Peter answering said ˱to˲_him, “Behold, we left all \add things\add* and followed ˱after˲_you; what consequently will_be ˱to˲_us?”
\v 28 And - \nd Jesus\nd* said ˱to˲_them, “Truly, ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all that you_all who /having/_followed ˱after˲_me in the regeneration, whenever the Son - ˱of˲_Man /may/_sit_down on /the/_throne ˱of˲_glory ˱of˲_him, you_all also /will_be/_sitting on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes - ˱of˲_Israel.
\v 29 And everyone who left houses, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or farms, on_account the name ˱of˲_me, /will_be/_receiving hundred_fold and /will_be/_inheriting eternal life.
\v 30 But many /the/_first will_be, /the/_last, and /the/_last first.
\c 20
\v 1 ¶ For the Kingdom ˱of˲_the Heavens is similar ˱to˲_/a/_man, /a/_home_owner, who came_out together_with in_the_morning /to/_hire workers for the vineyard ˱of˲_him.
\v 2 And /having/_agreed_together with the workers for /a/_denarius ˱for˲_the day, ˱he˲_sent_ them _out into the vineyard ˱of˲_him.
\v 3 And /having/_come_out about /the/_third hour, ˱he˲_saw others /having/_stood idle in the marketplace;
\v 4 and ˱to˲_those ˱he˲_said, ‘You_all also /be/_going into the vineyard, and whatever - may_be right, ˱I˲_/will_be/_giving ˱to˲_you_all.’
\v 5 And they went_away. again /having/_come_out about /the/_sixth and ninth hour, ˱he˲_did likewise.
\v 6 And /having/_come_out about the eleventh, ˱he˲_found others /having/_stood, and ˱he˲_/is/_saying ˱to˲_them, ‘Why /have/_˱you_all˲_stood here idle all - day?’
\v 7 ˱They˲_/are/_saying ˱to˲_him, ‘Because no_one hired us.’ ˱He˲_/is/_saying ˱to˲_them, ‘You_all /be/_going also into the vineyard.’
\v 8 And /having/_become evening the master ˱of˲_the vineyard /is/_saying ˱to˲_the manager ˱of˲_him, ‘Call the workers and give_back ˱to˲_them the wage, /having/_begun from the last to the first.’
\v 9 And the \add ones\add* /having/_come about the eleventh hour, each received /a/_denarius.
\v 10 And the first \add ones\add* /having/_come thought that ˱they˲_/will_be/_receiving more, but they each also received /a/_denarius.
\v 11 And /having/_received, ˱they˲_/were/_grumbling against the home_owner
\v 12 saying, ‘These - last \add ones\add* worked one hour, and ˱you˲_made them equal ˱to˲_us, ˱to˲_the \add ones\add* /having/_borne the burden ˱of˲_the day and the scorching_heat.’
\v 13 But he answering ˱of˲_them said ˱to˲_one ‘Friend, ˱I˲_/am/_=> not <=_doing_wrong ˱to˲_you. Not ˱you˲_agreed_together ˱for˲_/a/_denarius ˱with˲_me?
\v 14 Take_up what \add is\add* your and /Be/_going but. ˱I˲_/am/_wanting /to/_give ˱to˲_this - last as also ˱to˲_you.
\v 15 Or not /is/_˱it˲_permitting ˱for˲_me, what ˱I˲_/am/_willing /to/_do with - mine? Or is the eye ˱of˲_you evil, because I am good?’
\v 16 Thus the last will_be first, and the first last.”
\v 17 ¶ And - \nd Jesus\nd* going_up to Jerusalem, took the twelve disciples by themselves, and on the way ˱he˲_said ˱to˲_them,
\v 18 “Behold, ˱we˲_/are/_going_up to Jerusalem, and the Son - ˱of˲_Man /will_be_being/_given_over ˱to˲_the chief_priests and scribes, and ˱they˲_/will_be/_condemning him ˱to˲_death,
\v 19 and ˱they˲_/will_be/_giving_ him _over ˱to˲_the pagans, in_order that /to/_mock, and /to/_flog, and /to/_crucify, and ˱on˲_the third day ˱he˲_/will_be/_rising_up.”
\v 20 ¶ Then the mother ˱of˲_the sons ˱of˲_Zebedee with the sons ˱of˲_her approached ˱to˲_him, kneeling and requesting something from him.
\v 21 And he said ˱to˲_her, “What /are/_˱you˲_wanting?” ˱She˲_/is/_saying ˱to˲_him, “Say that these - two sons ˱of˲_me /may/_sit_down, one on /the/_right and one on /the/_left ˱of˲_you in the kingdom ˱of˲_you.”
\v 22 But - \nd Jesus\nd* answering said, “˱You_all˲_/have/_=> not <=_known what ˱you_all˲_/are/_requesting. /Are/_˱you_all˲_being_able /to/_drink the cup which I /am/_going /to_be/_drinking?” ˱They˲_/are/_saying ˱to˲_him, “˱We˲_/are/_being_able.”
\v 23 ˱He˲_/is/_saying ˱to˲_them, “On_one_hand ˱you_all˲_/will_be/_drinking the cup ˱of˲_me, on_the_other_hand - /to/_sit_down on /the/_right ˱of˲_me and on /the/_left, is not mine /to/_give, but ˱for˲_whom ˱it˲_/has_been/_prepared by the Father ˱of˲_me.”
\v 24 ¶ And /having/_heard, the ten resented about the two brothers.
\v 25 But - \nd Jesus\nd* /having/_called_to them said, “˱You_all˲_/have/_known that the rulers ˱of˲_the pagans /are/_exercising_lordship ˱over˲_them, and the great \add ones\add* /are/_exercising_authority ˱over˲_them.
\v 26 ˱it˲_will_ not _be thus among you_all; but whoever - among you_all /may_be/_wanting /to/_become great, ˱he˲_will_be servant ˱of˲_you_all,
\v 27 and whoever - among you_all /may_be/_wanting to_be first, ˱he˲_will_be slave ˱of˲_you_all;
\v 28 as the Son - ˱of˲_Man came not /to_be/_served, but /to/_serve and /to/_give the life ˱of˲_him /a/_ransom for many.”
\v 29 ¶ And them going_out from Jericho, /a/_=> great <=_crowd followed ˱after˲_him.
\v 30 And behold, two blind \add men\add* sitting beside the road, /having/_heard that \nd Jesus\nd* /is/_passing_by, ˱they˲_cried_out saying, show_mercy ˱to˲_us, \nd Lord\nd*, Son ˱of˲_David.
\v 31 And the crowd warned ˱to˲_them that ˱they˲_/may/_keep_silent. But they cried_out greater saying, “\nd Lord\nd*, show_mercy ˱to˲_us, Son ˱of˲_David.”
\v 32 And - \nd Jesus\nd* /having/_stopped, called them and said, “What /are/_˱you_all˲_wanting ˱I˲_/may/_do ˱for˲_you_all?”
\v 33 ˱They˲_/are/_saying ˱to˲_him, “\nd Lord\nd*, that /may_be/_opening_up the eyes ˱of˲_us.”
\v 34 And - \nd Jesus\nd* /having_been/_feeling_compassion, touched ˱against˲_the eyes ˱of˲_them, and immediately ˱they˲_received_sight and ˱they˲_followed ˱after˲_him.
\c 21
\v 1 ¶ And when ˱they˲_neared to Jerusalem and came to Bethphage to the Mount - ˱of˲_Olives, then \nd Jesus\nd* sent_out Two disciples
\v 2 saying ˱to˲_them, “/Be/_going into the village, - in_front_of ˱of˲_you_all, and immediately ˱you_all˲_/will_be/_finding /a/_donkey /having_been/_bound and /a/_colt with her; /having/_untied \add them\add* bring \add them\add* ˱to˲_me.
\v 3 And - anyone /may/_say anything ˱to˲_you_all, ˱you_all˲_/will_be/_saying, - ‘The \nd Lord\nd* /is/_having need ˱of˲_them’, and immediately ˱he˲_/will_be/_sending_ them _out.”
\v 4 And this all /has/_become, in_order_that the \add word\add* /may_be/_fulfilled /having_been/_spoken by the prophet saying,
\v 5 “say ˱to˲_the daughter ˱of˲_Zion, ‘Behold, the king ˱of˲_you /is/_coming ˱to˲_you, gentle and /having/_mounted on /a/_donkey and on /a/_colt, /the/_son ˱of˲_/a/_donkey.’”
\v 6 And the disciples /having_been/_gone, and /having/_done as - \nd Jesus\nd* directed ˱to˲_them,
\v 7 ˱they˲_brought the donkey and the colt, and ˱they˲_put_on their coats on them, and ˱he˲_sat_on on them.
\v 8 And the very_great crowd spread the coats ˱of˲_themselves on the road, and others /were/_cutting_off branches from the trees, and /were/_spreading \add them\add* on the road.
\v 9 And the crowds - going_before him and the \add ones\add* following /were/_crying_out saying, “Hosanna ˱to˲_the Son ˱of˲_David! the \add one\add* coming in /the/_name ˱of˲_/the/_\nd Lord\nd* ‘/Having_been/_blessed!’ Hosanna in the highest!”
\v 10 And ˱of˲_him /having/_come_in into Jerusalem, all the city /was/_shaken saying, “Who is this?”
\v 11 And the crowds /were/_saying, “This is the prophet \nd Jesus\nd*, the \add one\add* from Nazareth - ˱of˲_Galilee.”
\v 12 ¶ And \nd Jesus\nd* came_in into the temple, and ˱he˲_cast_out all the \add ones\add* selling and buying in the temple, and ˱he˲_overturned the tables ˱of˲_the moneychangers, and the seats ˱of˲_the \add ones\add* selling the doves.
\v 13 And ˱he˲_/is/_saying ˱to˲_them, “˱It˲_/has_been/_written, ‘the house ˱of˲_me /will_be_being/_called /a/_house ˱of˲_prayer’, but you_all /are/_making it ‘/a/_hideout ˱of˲_robbers’.”
\v 14 ¶ And blind and lame in the temple approached, ˱to˲_him, and ˱he˲_healed them.
\v 15 But the chief_priests and the scribes /having/_seen, the wonders that ˱he˲_did, and the children - crying_out in the temple and saying, “Hosanna ˱to˲_the Son ˱of˲_David”, ˱they˲_resented
\v 16 and said ˱to˲_him, “/Are/_˱you˲_hearing what these /are/_saying?” And - \nd Jesus\nd* /is/_saying ˱to˲_them, “Yes, ˱you_all˲_> never <_read, - ‘˱you˲_prepared praise out_of mouth ˱of˲_infants and nursing,’?”
\v 17 And /having/_left them, ˱he˲_came_out out the city to Bethany, and /was/_lodged there.
\v 18 ¶ And ¶ in_the_morning setting_out into the city, ˱he˲_hungered.
\v 19 And /having/_seen one fig_tree on the road, ˱he˲_came to it and nothing found on it, except - only leaves, and ˱he˲_/is/_saying ˱to˲_it, “Fruit “/May/_=> no_longer <=_become from you for the age.” And immediately the fig_tree /was/_withered.
\v 20 And the disciples /having/_seen \add it\add* marveled saying, “How /was/_=> the fig_tree immediately <=_withered?”
\v 21 And - \nd Jesus\nd* answering, said ˱to˲_them, “Truly, ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all, if ˱you_all˲_/may_be/_having faith and not /may_be/_doubted, not only /will_˱you_all˲_/be_doing the \add miracle\add* ˱of˲_the fig_tree, but even_if ˱you_all˲_/may/_say ˱to˲_the this mountain, ‘/Be/_taken_away and /be/_cast into the sea’, ˱it˲_/will_be/_becoming.
\v 22 And all \add things\add* as_many_as - ˱you_all˲_/may/_request in - prayer believing, ˱you_all˲_/will_be/_receiving.”
\v 23 ¶ And ˱with˲_him /having/_come into the temple, teaching the chief_priests and the elders ˱of˲_the people approached ˱to˲_him saying, “By what authority /are/_˱you˲_doing these \add things\add*? And who gave - this authority ˱to˲_you?”
\v 24 And - \nd Jesus\nd* answering, said ˱to˲_them, “Also_I “/Will_be/_asking you_all one word, which if ˱you_all˲_/may/_tell ˱to˲_me, also_I /will_be/_saying ˱to˲_you_all by what authority ˱I˲_/am/_doing these \add things\add*.
\v 25 The baptism - ˱of˲_John, from_where was_˱it˲? From heaven or from humans?” And they /were/_reasoning among themselves saying, “If ˱we˲_/may/_say, ‘From heaven’, ˱he˲_/will_be/_saying ˱to˲_us, ‘Therefore for_ why _reason ˱you_all˲_> not <_believed ˱in˲_him?’
\v 26 But if ˱we˲_/may/_say, ‘From humans’, ˱we˲_/are/_fearing the crowd, for all /are/_having - John as /a/_prophet.”
\v 27 And answering - ˱to˲_\nd Jesus\nd*, /they/_said, “˱We˲_/have/_=> not <=_known.” he /was/_saying ˱to˲_them also, “Neither I /am/_telling ˱to˲_you_all by what authority ˱I˲_/am/_doing these \add things\add*.
\v 28 ¶ But what /is/_˱it˲_supposing ˱to˲_you_all? /A/_man /was/_having two children. And /having/_approached ˱to˲_the_> first <_\add one\add* ˱he˲_said, ‘Child, /be/_going today, /be/_working in the vineyard.’ ˱of˲_me.’
\v 29 And he answering said, ‘˱I˲_/am/_=> not <=_willing’; later /having_been/_regretful, ˱he˲_went_away.
\v 30 And /having/_approached ˱to˲_the other \add child\add* ˱he˲_said likewise. And he answering said, ‘I \add will\add*, sir’; but went_ not _away.
\v 31 Which of the two did the will ˱of˲_the father?” ˱They˲_/are/_saying, “The first.” - \nd Jesus\nd* /is/_saying ˱to˲_them, “Truly, ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all that the tax_collectors and the prostitutes /are/_going_before you_all into the Kingdom - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*.
\v 32 For John came to you_all in /the/_way ˱of˲_righteousness, and ˱you_all˲_> not <_believed ˱in˲_him, but the tax_collectors and the prostitutes believed ˱in˲_him; and you_all /having/_seen, ˱you_all˲_/were/_=> not <=_regretful later - /to/_believe ˱in˲_him.
\v 33 ¶ Hear another parable: /a/_man was /a/_home_owner, who planted /a/_vineyard, and put_ /a/_fence _around ˱to˲_it, ‘and dug /a/_winepress in it, and built /a/_tower’, and rented_ it _out ˱to˲_tenant_farmers, and traveled.
\v 34 And when the season ˱of˲_the fruits neared, ˱he˲_sent_out the slaves ˱of˲_him to the tenant_farmers, /to/_receive the fruits ˱of˲_him.
\v 35 And the tenant_farmers /having/_taken the slaves ˱of˲_him, on_one_hand that ˱they˲_beat, on_the_other_hand that ˱they˲_killed_off, on_the_other_hand that ˱they˲_threw_stones.
\v 36 Again ˱he˲_sent_out other slaves, more \add than\add* the first, and ˱they˲_did likewise ˱to˲_them.
\v 37 But later ˱he˲_sent_out the son ˱of˲_him to them saying, ‘˱They˲_/will_be_being/_swayed ˱by˲_the son ˱of˲_me.’
\v 38 But the tenant_farmers /having/_seen the son, said among themselves, ‘This is the heir; come, ˱we˲_/may/_kill_ him _off and ˱we˲_/may/_have the inheritance ˱of˲_him.’
\v 39 And /having/_taken him, ˱they˲_cast_out \add him\add* out the vineyard and ˱they˲_killed_off \add him\add*.
\v 40 Therefore whenever the master ˱of˲_the vineyard /may/_come, what ˱he˲_/will_be/_doing - ˱to˲_> those <_tenant_farmers?”
\v 41 ˱They˲_/are/_saying ˱to˲_him, “˱He˲_/will_be/_destroying them evil \add ones\add* miserably, and /will_be/_renting_out the vineyard ˱to˲_other tenant_farmers, who /will_be/_giving_back ˱to˲_him the fruits in the seasons ˱of˲_them.”
\v 42 ¶ - \nd Jesus\nd* /is/_saying ˱to˲_them, “˱You_all˲_> never <_read in the Scriptures, ‘/the/_stone which the \add ones\add* building rejected, this /was/_become for /the/_head ˱of˲_/the/_corner; this became from /the/_\nd Lord\nd*, and ˱it˲_is marvelous in /the/_eyes ˱of˲_us’?
\v 43 Because_of this ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all the Kingdom - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd* /will_be_being/_taken_away from you_all, and ˱it˲_/will_be_being/_given ˱to˲_/a/_people producing the fruits ˱of˲_it.
\v 44 And the \add one\add* /having/_fallen on - this stone, /will_be_being/_shattered; on but whomever - ˱it˲_/may/_fall, ˱it˲_/will_be/_pulverizing him.”
\v 45 ¶ And the chief_priests and the Pharisees /having/_heard the parables ˱of˲_him, ˱they˲_knew that ˱he˲_/is/_speaking about them.
\v 46 And seeking /to/_apprehend him, ˱they˲_/were/_afraid the crowds, because ˱they˲_/were/_having him for /a/_prophet.
\c 22
\v 1 ¶ And - \nd Jesus\nd* answering again spoke in parables ˱to˲_them saying,
\v 2 the Kingdom ˱of˲_the Heavens “/Was/_likened ˱to˲_/a/_man, /a/_king, who made /a/_wedding_festivities ˱for˲_the son ˱of˲_him.
\v 3 And sent_out the slaves ˱of˲_him, /to/_call the \add ones\add* /having_been/_invited to the wedding_festivities, and ˱they˲_/were/_=> not <=_willing /to/_come.
\v 4 Again ˱he˲_sent_out other slaves saying, ‘Say ˱to˲_the \add ones\add* /having_been/_invited, “Behold, ˱I˲_/have/_prepared the dinner ˱of˲_me, the bulls ˱of˲_me and the grain_fed /having_been/_sacrificed, and all \add things\add* /are/_ready; come to the wedding_festivities.”’
\v 5 But they /having/_neglected went_away, on_one_hand that \add one\add* to his own field, on_the_other_hand that \add one\add* to the business ˱of˲_him.
\v 6 And the rest /having/_apprehended the slaves ˱of˲_him, ˱they˲_mistreated and ˱they˲_killed_off \add them\add*.
\v 7 But the king /was/_angered, and /having/_sent the armies ˱of˲_him, destroyed - those murderers, and inflamed the city ˱of˲_them.
\v 8 Then ˱he˲_/is/_saying ˱to˲_the slaves ˱of˲_him, ‘On_one_hand the wedding is ready, on_the_other_hand the \add ones\add* /having_been/_invited were not worthy.
\v 9 Therefore /be/_going in the thoroughfares ˱of˲_the roads, and as_many_as - ˱you_all˲_/may/_find, invite to the wedding_festivities.’
\v 10 And - those slaves /having/_come_out, into the roads, ˱they˲_gathered_together all whom ˱they˲_found, both evil and good; and the wedding /was/_filled ˱of˲_reclining \add ones\add*.
\v 11 But the king /having/_come_in /to/_see the \add ones\add* reclining, ˱he˲_saw there /a/_man not /having/_dressed_in clothing ˱of˲_wedding;
\v 12 and ˱he˲_/is/_saying ˱to˲_him, ‘Friend, how ˱you˲_came_in here not having clothing ˱of˲_wedding?’ And he /was/_silenced.
\v 13 Then the king said ˱to˲_the servants, ‘/Having/_bound ˱of˲_him /the/_feet and hands, cast_ him _out into the - outer darkness; there will_be - weeping and - gnashing - ˱of˲_teeth.’
\v 14 For many are called, but few chosen.”
\v 15 ¶ Then the Pharisees /having_been/_gone, took counsel so_that ˱they˲_/may/_trap him in word.
\v 16 And ˱they˲_/are/_sending_out ˱to˲_him the disciples ˱of˲_them with the Herodians saying, “Teacher, ˱we˲_/have/_known that ˱you˲_are true, and ˱you˲_/are/_teaching the way - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd* in truth, and ˱it˲_/is/_=> not <=_caring ˱to˲_you about no_one, for ˱you˲_/are/_=> not <=_looking on appearance ˱of˲_people.
\v 17 Therefore tell ˱to˲_us, what /is/_˱it˲_supposing ˱to˲_you? /Is/_˱it˲_permitting /to/_give poll_tax ˱to˲_Caesar or not?”
\v 18 But - \nd Jesus\nd* /having/_known the wickedness ˱of˲_them ˱he˲_said, “Why ˱you_all˲_/are/_testing me, hypocrites?
\v 19 Show ˱to˲_me the coin ˱of˲_the poll_tax.” And they brought /a/_denarius ˱to˲_him.
\v 20 And ˱he˲_/is/_saying ˱to˲_them, ˱of˲_whose_> “- image <_\add is\add* this and the inscription?”
\v 21 ˱They˲_/are/_saying, “˱Of˲_Caesar.” Then ˱he˲_/is/_saying ˱to˲_them, “Therefore give_back the \add things\add* ˱of˲_Caesar ˱to˲_Caesar, and the \add things\add* - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd* - ˱to˲_\nd God\nd*.”
\v 22 And /having/_heard ˱they˲_marveled, and /having/_left him ˱they˲_went_away.
\v 23 ¶ On that - day Sadducees approached ˱to˲_him saying, not to_be /a/_resurrection, and ˱they˲_asked him
\v 24 saying, “Teacher, Moses said, ‘if anyone /may/_die_off not having children, the brother ˱of˲_him /will_be/_marrying the wife ˱of˲_him, and ˱he˲_/will_be/_raising_up children ˱for˲_the brother ˱of˲_him.’
\v 25 And ˱they˲_were among us seven brothers; and the first /having/_married died, and not having seed, left the wife ˱of˲_him ˱to˲_the brother ˱of˲_him.
\v 26 Likewise also the second, and the third, to the seven,
\v 27 and last ˱of˲_all, the woman died_off.
\v 28 The therefore in resurrection, ˱she˲_will_be /the/_wife ˱of˲_which ˱of˲_the seven? For all had her.”
\v 29 ¶ And - \nd Jesus\nd* answering, said ˱to˲_them, “˱You_all˲_/are_being/_strayed, not /having/_known the Scriptures, nor the power - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*.
\v 30 For in the resurrection, ˱they˲_/are/_=> neither <=_marrying nor /are_being/_betrothed, but ˱they˲_are like angels in - heaven.
\v 31 But concerning the resurrection ˱of˲_the dead, ˱you_all˲_> not <_read the \add word\add* /having_been/_spoken ˱to˲_you_all by - \nd God\nd* saying,
\v 32 ‘I am the \nd God\nd* ˱of˲_Abraham, and the \nd God\nd* ˱of˲_Isaac, and the \nd God\nd* ˱of˲_Jacob’? \nd God\nd* is not ˱of˲_/the/_dead, but ˱of˲_/the/_living.”
\v 33 And the crowds /having/_heard, ˱they˲_/were_being/_astonished at the teaching ˱of˲_him.
\v 34 ¶ But the Pharisees /having/_heard that ˱he˲_silenced the Sadducees, /were/_gathered_together with the same.
\v 35 And one of them, /a/_lawyer testing him asked,
\v 36 “Teacher, which commandment \add is\add* great in the law?”
\v 37 And he /was/_saying ˱to˲_him, “‘˱You˲_/will_be/_loving /the/_\nd Lord\nd* the \nd God\nd* ˱of˲_you with all heart ˱of˲_you, and with all soul ˱of˲_you, and with all the mind ˱of˲_you.’
\v 38 This is the great and first commandment.
\v 39 /The/_second similar ˱to˲_it, ‘˱you˲_/will_be/_loving the neighbor ˱of˲_you as yourself.’
\v 40 all the law and the prophets /is_being/_hanged.” On these - two commandments.”
\v 41 ¶ And the Pharisees /having_been/_gathered_together, - \nd Jesus\nd* asked them
\v 42 saying, “What /is/_supposing ˱to˲_you_all concerning the \nd Messiah\nd*? ˱Of˲_whom son is_˱he˲?” ˱They˲_/are/_saying ˱to˲_him, “˱Of˲_the \add son\add* ˱of˲_David.”
\v 43 ˱He˲_/is/_saying ˱to˲_them, “Therefore how David in \nd Spirit\nd* /is/_calling him \nd Lord\nd* saying,
\v 44 /the/_\nd Lord\nd* said ˱to˲_the \nd Lord\nd* ˱of˲_me, “/Be/_sitting on /the/_right \add hand\add* ˱of˲_me, until - ˱I˲_/may/_put the enemies ˱of˲_you beneath ˱for˲_the feet ˱of˲_you”’?
\v 45 Therefore if David /is/_calling him, ‘\nd Lord\nd*’, how is_˱he˲ /the/_son ˱of˲_him?”
\v 46 And no_one /was/_able /to/_answer /a/_word ˱to˲_him, nor dared anyone from that - day /to/_ask him no_longer.
\c 23
\v 1 ¶ Then \nd Jesus\nd* spoke ˱to˲_the crowds and ˱to˲_the disciples ˱of˲_him
\v 2 saying, the scribes and the Pharisees sat_down “On the seat ˱of˲_Moses.
\v 3 Therefore all \add things\add* as_much_as - ˱they˲_/may/_tell ˱to˲_you_all, do and /be/_keeping, but /be/_=> not <=_doing according_to the works ˱of˲_them, for ˱they˲_/are/_speaking and ˱they˲_/are/_=> not <=_doing.
\v 4 And ˱they˲_/are/_binding heavy and unbearable burdens, and ˱they˲_/are/_laying_on \add them\add* on the shoulders - ˱of˲_people, but they ˱with˲_the finger ˱of˲_them not /are/_willing /to/_move them.
\v 5 But all the works ˱of˲_them, ˱they˲_/are/_doing in_order that /to_be/_seen ˱by˲_the people. For ˱they˲_/are/_widening the phylacteries ˱of˲_them and ˱they˲_/are/_magnifying their tassels.
\v 6 And ˱they˲_/are/_loving the best_place at the suppers, and the best_seats in the synagogues,

\v 8 But you_all /may_ not _be/_called ‘Rabbi’, for one is the instructor, ˱of˲_you_all. and you_all are all brothers.
\v 9 And ˱you_all˲_/may/_=> not <=_call ˱of˲_you_all on the earth ‘Father’, for one is the - heavenly Father ˱of˲_you_all.
\v 10 Nor /may_˱you_all˲_/be_called ‘Instructors’, because one is /the/_instructor ˱of˲_you_all, the \nd Messiah\nd*.
\v 11 And the greater ˱of˲_you_all will_be servant ˱of˲_you_all.
\v 12 And whoever /will_be/_exalting himself, /will_be_being/_humbled, and whoever /will_be/_humbling himself, /will_be_being/_exalted.
\v 13 ¶ But woe ˱to˲_you_all, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! Because ˱you_all˲_/are/_shutting the Kingdom ˱of˲_the Heavens before the people; for you_all neither /are/_coming_in, nor /are/_˱you_all˲_allowing the \add ones\add* coming_in /to/_come_in.

\v 15 Woe ˱to˲_you_all, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! Because ˱you_all˲_/are/_going_around the sea and the dry \add land\add* /to/_make one convert, and whenever ˱he˲_/may/_become, ˱you_all˲_/are/_making him /a/_son ˱of˲_Gehenna twice_more \add than\add* you_all.
\v 16 ¶ Woe ˱to˲_you_all, blind guides, you_all saying, ‘Whoever - /may/_swear by the temple, ˱it˲_is nothing, but whoever - /may/_swear by the gold ˱of˲_the temple /is/_owing.’
\v 17 Foolish and blind! For which is greater, the gold or the temple which /having/_sanctified the gold?
\v 18 And, ‘Whoever - /may/_swear by the altar, ˱it˲_is nothing, but whoever - /may/_swear by the gift - on it /is/_owing.’
\v 19 Foolish and blind! For which greater, the gift, or the altar - sanctifying the gift?
\v 20 Therefore the \add one\add* /having/_swore by the altar, /is/_swearing by it and by all the \add things\add* on it.
\v 21 And the \add one\add* /having/_swore by the temple, /is/_swearing by it and by the \add one\add* dwelling_in it.
\v 22 And the \add one\add* /having/_swore by - heaven, /is/_swearing by the throne - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd* and by the \add one\add* sitting on it.
\v 23 ¶ Woe ˱to˲_you_all, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! Because ˱you_all˲_/are/_tithing - mint, and - dill, and - cummin, and ˱you_all˲_left the heavier ˱of˲_the law: - justice, and - mercy, and - faith. But ˱it˲_/was/_fitting /to/_do these \add things\add*, and_those not /to/_leave.
\v 24 Blind guides! You_all straining_out the gnat and swallowing_up the camel!
\v 25 ¶ Woe ˱to˲_you_all, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! Because ˱you_all˲_/are/_cleansing the \add part\add* outside ˱of˲_the cup and ˱of˲_the dish, but inside ˱they˲_/are/_being_full of theft and intemperance.

\v 27 ¶ Woe ˱to˲_you_all, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! Because ˱you_all˲_/are/_being_like ˱to˲_tombs /having_been/_whitewashed, which on_one_hand /are/_appearing beautiful outwardly, on_the_other_hand inside ˱they˲_/are/_being_full ˱of˲_bones ˱of˲_/the/_dead and ˱of˲_all impurity.
\v 28 Thus also on_one_hand you_all /are_being/_seen righteous outwardly ˱by˲_the people, on_the_other_hand inside ˱you_all˲_are full ˱of˲_hypocrisy and lawlessness.
\v 29 ¶ Woe ˱to˲_you_all, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! Because ˱you_all˲_/are/_building the tombs ˱of˲_the prophets, and ˱you_all˲_/are/_adorning the tombs ˱of˲_the righteous

\c 24
\v 1 ¶ And - \nd Jesus\nd* /having/_come_out from the temple /was/_going, and approached the disciples ˱of˲_him, /to/_show ˱to˲_him the buildings ˱of˲_the temple.
\v 2 And he answering said ˱to˲_them, “˱You_all˲_/are/_=> not <=_seeing all these \add things\add*? Truly, ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all, by_no_means /may_ not _be/_left here stone on stone, which /will_ not _be_being/_torn_down.”
\v 3 ¶ And him sitting on the Mount - ˱of˲_Olives, the disciples approached ˱to˲_him by themselves saying, “Tell ˱to˲_us when these \add things\add* will_be, and what \add is\add* the sign ˱of˲_the your coming and /the/_completion ˱of˲_the age?”

\v 10 And then many /will_be_being/_stumbled, and ˱they˲_/will_be/_giving_over one_another and ˱they˲_/will_be/_hating one_another.
\v 11 And many false_prophets /will_be_being/_raised and /will_be/_misleading many.

\v 30 And then the sign ˱of˲_the Son - ˱of˲_Man /will_be_being/_seen in /the/_sky, and then all the tribes ˱of˲_the earth /will_be/_mourning, and ˱they˲_/will_be/_seeing ‘the Son - ˱of˲_Man, coming on the clouds ˱of˲_the sky’ with power and great glory.
\v 31 And ˱he˲_/will_be/_sending_out the angels ˱of˲_him with ‘/a/_=> great <=_trumpet cry, and ˱they˲_/will_be/_gathering_together’ the chosen ˱of˲_him from the four winds, from /the/_extremities ˱of˲_/the/_heavens to /the/_extremities ˱of˲_them.
\v 32 ¶ And learn the parable of the fig_tree: whenever the branch ˱of˲_it /may/_=> already <=_become tender and the leaves /may_be/_sprouting_out, ˱you_all˲_/are/_knowing that the summer \add is\add* near.
\v 33 Thus also you_all whenever ˱you_all˲_/may/_see all these \add things\add*, ˱you_all˲_/are/_knowing that ˱it˲_is near at /the/_doors.
\v 34 Truly, ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all that by_no_means - this generation /may/_=> not <=_pass_away, until - all these \add things\add* /may/_become.
\v 35 The heaven and the earth /will_be/_passing_away, but - /the/_words ˱of˲_me by_no_means /may/_=> not <=_pass_away.
\v 36 ¶ But no_one /has/_known concerning - ˱of˲_> that <_day and hour, not_even the angels ˱of˲_the heavens, nor the Son, except - only the Father.
\v 37 As \add were\add* for the days - ˱of˲_Noah, thus the coming ˱of˲_the Son - ˱of˲_Man will_be.
\v 38 For as ˱they˲_were in the days - before the flood eating and drinking, marrying and betrothing, until that day Noah came_in, into the ark.
\v 39 And ˱they˲_> not <_knew, until the flood came and took_ all _away, thus the coming ˱of˲_the Son - ˱of˲_Man will_be.
\v 40 Then two will_be in the field, one /is_being/_taken, and one /is_being/_left.
\v 41 Two grinding at the millstone, one /is_being/_taken, and one /is_being/_left.
\v 42 Therefore /be/_watching, because ˱you_all˲_/have/_=> not <=_known ˱on˲_what day the \nd Lord\nd* ˱of˲_you_all /is/_coming.
\v 43 But that ˱you_all˲_/are/_knowing that if the home_owner /had/_known, ˱in˲_what watch the thief /is/_coming, ˱he˲_> would <_watched, and would not allowed the house ˱of˲_him /to_be/_dug_through.
\v 44 Because_of this also, you_all /be/_becoming ready, because ˱you_all˲_/are/_=> not <=_supposing ˱in˲_that hour, the Son - ˱of˲_Man /is/_coming.
\v 45 ¶ Who consequently is the faithful and prudent slave, whom the master appointed over the household ˱of˲_him, - /to/_give ˱to˲_them the food in season?
\v 46 Blessed \add is\add* - that slave, whom the master ˱of˲_him /having/_come /will_be/_finding doing thus.

\v 48 But if the that evil slave /may/_say in the heart ˱of˲_him, ‘The master ˱of˲_me /is/_delaying’,
\v 49 and ˱he˲_/may/_begin /to_be/_striking the fellow-slaves ˱of˲_him, and /may_be/_eating also /may_be/_drinking with the \add ones\add* being_drunk,

\v 1 ¶ Then the Kingdom ˱of˲_the ˱to˲_Ten /will_be_being/_likened Heavens virgins, who /having/_taken the lamps ˱of˲_them came_out in meeting ˱of˲_the bridegroom.
\v 2 And five of them were foolish, and five \add were\add* prudent.
\v 3 For the foolish /having/_taken the lamps ˱of˲_them, ˱they˲_> not <_took olive_oil; with themselves;
\v 4 but the prudent took olive_oil in their containers, with the lamps ˱of˲_themselves.
\v 5 And the bridegroom delaying, all nodding_off and /were/_sleeping.
\v 6 But ˱in˲_/the/_middle ˱of˲_/the/_night, /a/_clamor /has/_become, ‘Behold, the bridegroom!’ /Be/_coming_out to /the/_meeting.
\v 7 Then all - those virgins /were/_raised, and ˱they˲_trimmed the lamps ˱of˲_themselves.
\v 8 And the foolish said ˱to˲_the prudent, ‘Give ˱to˲_us of the olive_oil ˱of˲_you_all, because the lamps ˱of˲_us /are_being/_extinguished.’
\v 9 But the prudent answered saying, ‘Lest by_no_means /may/_=> not <=_suffice ˱for˲_us and you_all; rather /be/_going to the \add ones\add* selling, and buy ˱for˲_yourselves.’
\v 10 And them going_away /to/_buy, the bridegroom came, and the ready \add ones\add* came_in with him to the wedding_festivities, and the door /was/_shut.
\v 11 And later the other virgins /are/_=> also <=_coming saying, ‘Sir, sir, open_up ˱to˲_us!’
\v 12 But he answering said, ‘Truly, ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all, ˱I˲_/have/_=> not <=_known you_all.’
\v 13 Therefore /be/_watching, because ˱you_all˲_/have/_=> neither <=_known the day, nor the hour.
\v 14 ¶ For as /a/_man traveling, called his own slaves, and gave_over the \add things\add* possessing ˱of˲_him ˱to˲_them.
\v 15 And on_one_hand ˱he˲_gave five talents ˱to˲_one, on_the_other_hand two ˱to˲_one, on_the_other_hand one ˱to˲_one, ˱to˲_each according_to his own ability, and ˱he˲_traveled immediately.
\v 16 /Having_been/_gone, the \add one\add* /having/_received the five talents, worked with them and gained other five talents.
\v 17 Likewise also the \add one\add* ˱with˲_the two, gained another two.
\v 18 But the \add one\add* /having/_received the one, /having/_gone_away dug /the/_ground and hid the silver ˱of˲_the master ˱of˲_him.
\v 19 And after much time, the master - ˱of˲_> those <_slaves /is/_coming, and ˱he˲_/is/_settling_accounts /the/_account with them.
\v 20 And /having/_approached the \add one\add*, /having/_received the five talents, brought /the/_other five talents saying, ‘Five, talents Master ˱you˲_gave_over ˱to˲_me, behold, ˱I˲_gained.’ another five talents.’
\v 21 the master ˱of˲_him /was/_saying ˱to˲_him, ‘Well \add done\add*, good and faithful slave! ˱You˲_were faithful over /a/_few \add things\add*, ˱I˲_/will_be/_appointing you over many \add things\add*; come_in into the joy ˱of˲_the master ˱of˲_you.’
\v 22 the \add one\add* ˱with˲_the two talents /having/_=> also <=_approached said, ‘Two, talents Master ˱you˲_gave_over ˱to˲_me. Behold, ˱I˲_gained.’ another two talents.’
\v 23 the master ˱of˲_him /Was/_saying ˱to˲_him, ‘Well \add done\add*, good and faithful slave! ˱You˲_were faithful over /a/_few \add things\add*, ˱I˲_/will_be/_appointing you over many \add things\add*; come_in into the joy ˱of˲_the master ˱of˲_you.’
\v 24 And the \add one\add* /having/_received ˱with˲_the one talent /having/_=> also <=_approached said, ‘Master, ˱I˲_knew you, that ˱you˲_are /a/_hard, man, reaping where ˱you˲_> not <_sowed, and gathering_together whence ˱you˲_> not <_scattered.
\v 25 And /having_been/_afraid /having/_gone_away, ˱I˲_hid the talent ˱of˲_you in the ground. Behold, ˱you˲_/are/_having - your \add own\add*.’
\v 26 But the master ˱of˲_him answering said ˱to˲_him, ‘Evil and reluctant Slave! ˱You˲_/had/_known that ˱I˲_/am/_reaping where ˱I˲_> not <_sowed, and ˱I˲_/am/_gathering_together whence ˱I˲_> not <_scattered?
\v 27 Therefore ˱it˲_/was/_fitting you /to/_put the silver_coins ˱of˲_me ˱to˲_the bankers, and /having/_come, I would received_back - mine with interest.
\v 28 Therefore take_ the talent _away from him, and give \add it\add* ˱to˲_the \add one\add* having the ten talents.
\v 29 For ˱to˲_everyone - having /will_be_being/_given and /will_be_being/_in_abundance, but the \add one\add* not having, even what ˱he˲_/is/_having /will_be_being/_taken_away from him.
\v 30 And cast_out the useless slave, into the - outer darkness. There will_be - weeping and - gnashing - ˱of˲_teeth.’
\v 31 ¶ But whenever the Son - ˱of˲_Man /may/_come in the glory ˱of˲_him, and all the angels with him, then ˱he˲_/will_be/_sitting_down on throne ˱of˲_glory ˱of˲_him.
\v 32 And all the nations /will_be_being/_gathered_together before him, and /will_be/_setting_apart them from one_another, as the shepherd /is/_setting_apart the sheep from the goats.
\v 33 And the /will_be/_standing on_one_hand sheep on /the/_right ˱of˲_him, on_the_other_hand the goats on /the/_left.
\v 34 Then the King /will_be/_saying ˱to˲_the \add ones\add* on /the/_right ˱of˲_him, ‘Come you_all /having_been/_blessed ˱of˲_the Father ˱of˲_me, inherit the kingdom /having_been/_prepared ˱for˲_you_all from /the/_foundation ˱of˲_/the/_world.
\v 35 For ˱I˲_hungered and ˱you_all˲_gave ˱to˲_me /to/_eat, ˱I˲_thirsted and ˱you_all˲_gave_ me _to_drink, ˱I˲_was /a/_stranger and ˱you_all˲_brought_ me _in,

\v 37 Then the righteous /will_be/_answering ˱to˲_him saying, ‘\nd Lord\nd*, when ˱we˲_saw you hungering and ˱we˲_fed, or thirsting and ˱we˲_gave_to_drink?

\v 39 And when ˱we˲_saw you sick or in prison, and ˱we˲_came to you?’
\v 40 And the King answering, /will_be/_saying ˱to˲_them, ‘Truly, ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all, for as_much_as ˱you_all˲_did \add it\add* ˱to˲_> the least <_one ˱of˲_these - brothers ˱of˲_me, ˱you_all˲_did \add it\add* ˱to˲_me.’

\v 1 ¶ And ˱it˲_became when - \nd Jesus\nd* finished all the words these, ˱he˲_said ˱to˲_the disciples ˱of˲_him,

\v 3 ¶ Then the chief_priests and the elders ˱of˲_the people /were/_gathered_together in the courtyard ˱of˲_the chief_priest, who /being/_called Caiaphas,

\v 8 But the disciples /having/_seen, resented saying, “For why - this destruction?
\v 9 For this /was/_able /to_be/_sold ˱for˲_much and /to_be/_given ˱to˲_/the/_poor.”
\v 10 But - \nd Jesus\nd* /having/_known, said ˱to˲_them, “Why /are/_˱you_all˲_bringing_about troubles ˱to˲_the women? For ˱she˲_did /a/_=> beautiful <=_work to me.

\v 14 ¶ Then one ˱of˲_the twelve, who /being/_called Judas Iscariot /having_been/_gone to the chief_priests
\v 15 ˱he˲_said, “What /are/_˱you_all˲_willing /to/_give ˱to˲_me, and_I /will_be/_giving_ him _over ˱to˲_you_all?” And they ˱they˲_set ˱to˲_him thirty silver_coins.

\v 35 - Peter /is/_saying ˱to˲_him, “Even_if ˱it˲_/may_be/_fitting me /to/_die_off with you, by_no_means ˱I˲_/will_ not _be/_renouncing you.” all the disciples also said Likewise.

\v 37 And /having/_taken - Peter and the two sons ˱of˲_Zebedee, ˱he˲_began /to_be_being/_sorrowed and /to_be/_distressing.
\v 38 Then ˱he˲_/is/_saying ˱to˲_them, “The soul ˱of˲_me is very_sorrowful to death; remain here and /be/_watching with me.”
\v 39 And /having/_approached /a/_little, ˱he˲_fell on /the/_face ˱of˲_him praying and saying, “Father ˱of˲_me, if ˱it˲_is possible, /let/_=> - this cup <=_pass_by from me. However not as I /am/_wanting, but as you.”
\v 40 And ˱he˲_/is/_coming to the disciples and /is/_finding them sleeping, and ˱he˲_/is/_saying - ˱to˲_Peter, “Thus ˱you_all˲_were_ not _able /to/_watch one hour with me?

\v 55 In that - hour, - \nd Jesus\nd* said ˱to˲_the crowds, ˱you_all˲_came_out with swords and clubs /to/_capture me “As against /a/_robber? In_every day in the temple, ˱I˲_/was/_sitting teaching, and ˱you_all˲_> not <_apprehended me.
\v 56 But this all /has/_become, in_order_that the \add things\add* Scriptures ˱of˲_the prophets /may_be/_fulfilled.” Then all the disciples, /having/_left him fled.
\v 57 ¶ And the \add ones\add* /having/_apprehended - \nd Jesus\nd*, led_away \add him\add* to Caiaphas the chief_priest, where the scribes and the elders /were/_gathered_together.
\v 58 But - Peter /was/_following ˱after˲_him from afar to the courtyard ˱of˲_the chief_priest, and /having/_come_in inside, ˱he˲_/was/_sitting with the attendants /to/_see the outcome.
\v 59 And the chief_priests and the whole Sanhedrin /were/_seeking false_witness against - \nd Jesus\nd*, so_that ˱they˲_/may/_put_ him _to_death,
\v 60 but ˱of˲_many /having/_approached false_witnesses. ˱they˲_> not <_found, But later /having/_approached two
\v 61 said, “This \add man\add* /was/_saying, ‘˱I˲_/am/_being_able /to/_tear_down the temple - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*, and /to/_build \add it\add* it by ˱of˲_three days.’”
\v 62 And the chief_priest /having/_stood_up, said ˱to˲_him, “/Are/_˱you˲_answering nothing, what these \add men\add* /are/_testifying ˱against˲_you?”
\v 63 But - \nd Jesus\nd* /was/_keeping_silent. And the chief_priest said ˱to˲_him, “˱I˲_/am/_adjuring you by the - living \nd God\nd* that ˱you˲_/may/_tell ˱to˲_us if you are the \nd Messiah\nd*, the Son ˱of˲_the \nd God\nd*.”
\v 64 - \nd Jesus\nd* /is/_saying ˱to˲_him, “You said \add it\add*. However ˱I˲_/am/_saying ˱to˲_you_all, from now ˱you_all˲_/will_be/_seeing the Son - ˱of˲_Man, ‘sitting on /the/_right \add hand\add*’ - ˱of˲_power, and ‘coming in the clouds ˱of˲_the sky’.”
\v 65 Then the chief_priest tore the robes ˱of˲_him saying, “˱He˲_slandered; why /are/_˱we˲_having anymore need ˱of˲_witnesses? Behold, now ˱you_all˲_heard the slander.
\v 66 What /is/_˱it˲_supposing ˱to˲_you_all?” And - answering ˱they˲_said, “˱He˲_is liable ˱of˲_death.”
\v 67 Then ˱they˲_spat in the face ˱of˲_him and ˱they˲_beat him, and they slapped \add him\add*
\v 68 saying, “Prophesy ˱to˲_us, \nd Messiah\nd*, who is the \add one\add* /having/_struck you?”
\v 69 ¶ And - Peter /was/_sitting outside in the courtyard, and one servant_girl approached ˱to˲_him saying, “You also /were/_were with \nd Jesus\nd* the Galilean.”
\v 70 But he disowned \add him\add* before all saying, “˱I˲_/have/_=> not <=_known what ˱you˲_/are/_saying.”
\v 71 And /having/_come_out to the gate, another saw him and ˱she˲_/is/_saying ˱to˲_the \add ones\add* there, “This \add man\add* was with \nd Jesus\nd* the Nazarene.”
\v 72 And again ˱he˲_disowned with /an/_oath, - “˱I˲_/have/_=> not <=_known the man.”
\v 73 And after /a/_little the \add ones\add* /having/_stood /having/_approached said - ˱to˲_Peter, “Truly also you are of them, for even the speech ˱of˲_you /is/_making you evident.”
\v 74 Then ˱he˲_began /to_be/_cursing and /to_be/_swearing, - “˱I˲_/have/_=> not <=_known the man!” And immediately /a/_rooster crowed.
\v 75 And - Peter /was/_reminded ˱of˲_the word ˱of˲_\nd Jesus\nd* /having/_said, - “before /the/_rooster /to/_crow, ˱you˲_/will_be/_renouncing me thrice”. And /having/_come_out out, ˱he˲_wept bitterly.
\c 27
\v 1 ¶ And /having/_become in_the_morning, all the chief_priests and the elders ˱of˲_the people took counsel against - \nd Jesus\nd*, so_that /to/_put_ him _to_death;
\v 2 and /having/_bound him ˱they˲_led_away and gave_over \add him\add* ˱to˲_Pilate the governor.
\v 3 ¶ Then Judas the \add one\add* giving_ him _over /having/_seen, that ˱he˲_/was/_condemned, /having_been/_regretful ˱he˲_returned the thirty silver_coins ˱to˲_the chief_priests and elders
\v 4 saying, “˱I˲_sinned /having/_given_over innocent blood.” But they said, “What \add is_it\add* to us? You /will_be/_seeing \add to_it\add*.”
\v 5 And /having/_thrown_down the silver_coins into the temple, ˱he˲_withdrew and /having/_gone_away hanged \add himself\add*.
\v 6 And the chief_priests /having/_taken the silver_coins said, “˱It˲_/is/_=> not <=_permitting /to/_put them into the temple_treasury, because ˱it˲_is /the/_price ˱of˲_blood.”
\v 7 And /having/_taken counsel, ˱they˲_bought with them the Field ˱of˲_the Potter, for /a/_burial_place ˱for˲_the strangers.
\v 8 Therefore - that field /was/_called, /the/_Field ˱of˲_Blood to the \add day\add* today.
\v 9 Then the \add word\add* /having_been/_spoken by Jeremiah the prophet /was/_fulfilled saying, “and ˱they˲_took the thirty silver_coins, the price ˱of˲_the \add one\add* /having_been/_priced, whom ˱they˲_priced” by /the/_sons ˱of˲_Israel,
\v 10 “and ˱they˲_gave them for the Field ˱of˲_the Potter, as /the/_\nd Lord\nd* directed ˱to˲_me”.
\v 11 ¶ And - \nd Jesus\nd* /was/_stood before the governor; and the governor asked him saying, “Are you the king ˱of˲_the Jews?” And - \nd Jesus\nd* /was/_saying ˱to˲_him, “You /are/_saying \add it\add*.”
\v 12 And in that /to_ him _be_being/_accused by the chief_priests and the elders, ˱he˲_answered nothing.
\v 13 Then - Pilate /is/_saying ˱to˲_him, “Not /are/_˱you˲_hearing how_many \add things\add* ˱against˲_you ˱they˲_/are/_testifying?”
\v 14 And ˱he˲_> not <_answered ˱to˲_him to not_even one word, so_as /to_be/_marveling the governor exceedingly.
\v 15 ¶ And concerning /the/_feast, the governor /had/_been_accustomed /to_be/_sending_away one prisoner ˱to˲_the crowd, whom ˱they˲_/were/_wanting.
\v 16 And ˱they˲_/were/_having then /the/_=> notable <=_prisoner, /being/_called Barabbas.
\v 17 Therefore ˱of˲_them /having_been/_gathered_together, - Pilate said ˱to˲_them, “Whom /are/_˱you_all˲_willing ˱I˲_/may/_send_away ˱to˲_you_all, Barabbas or \nd Jesus\nd*, who \add is\add* /being/_called /the/_\nd Messiah\nd*?”
\v 18 For ˱he˲_/had/_known that ˱they˲_gave_ him _over because_of envy.
\v 19 But him sitting on the tribunal, the wife ˱of˲_him sent_out to him saying, “\add Let_be\add* nothing ˱to˲_you and - that righteous \add man\add*, for ˱I˲_suffered many \add things\add* today in /a/_dream because_of him.”
\v 20 But the chief_priests and the elders persuaded the crowds, that ˱they˲_/may/_request - Barabbas, and ˱they˲_/may/_destroy - \nd Jesus\nd*.
\v 21 And the governor answering said ˱to˲_them, “Which /are/_˱you_all˲_wanting of the two, ˱I˲_/may/_send_away ˱to˲_you_all?” And they said, - “Barabbas.”
\v 22 - Pilate /is/_saying ˱to˲_them, “Therefore what /may/_˱I˲_do ˱to˲_\nd Jesus\nd*, who \add is\add* /being/_called /the/_\nd Messiah\nd*?” All /are/_saying, “/Let_˱him˲_/be_crucified.”
\v 23 And he /was/_saying, “For what evil ˱he˲_did?” And they /were/_=> exceedingly <=_crying_out saying, “/Let_˱him˲_/be_crucified.”
\v 24 And - Pilate /having/_seen that ˱it˲_/is/_benefiting nothing, but rather /is/_becoming /a/_commotion, /having/_taken water, ˱he˲_washed_off his hands in_front_of the crowd saying, “˱I˲_am innocent of the blood - this righteous \add one\add*;. You_all /will_be/_seeing \add to_it\add*.”
\v 25 And all the people answering said, “The blood ˱of˲_him \add is\add* on us and on the children ˱of˲_us.”
\v 26 Then ˱he˲_sent_ - Barabbas _away ˱to˲_them, but /having/_flogged - \nd Jesus\nd*, ˱he˲_gave_over \add him\add*, in_order_that ˱he˲_/may_be/_crucified.
\v 27 ¶ Then the soldiers ˱of˲_the governor, /having/_taken - \nd Jesus\nd* to the praetorium, gathered_together all the cohort before him.
\v 28 And /having/_stripped_ him _off, ˱they˲_put_around /a/_=> scarlet <=_robe ˱to˲_him,
\v 29 and /having/_twisted_together /a/_crown of thorns, ˱they˲_put_on \add it\add* on the head ˱of˲_him, and /a/_staff in the right \add hand\add* ˱of˲_him, and /having/_kneeled before him, ˱they˲_mocked ˱at˲_him saying, “Hail, the King ˱of˲_the Jews!”
\v 30 And /having/_spat on him, ˱they˲_took the reed, and ˱they˲_/were/_striking \add him\add* on the head ˱of˲_him.
\v 31 And when ˱they˲_mocked ˱at˲_him, ˱they˲_stripped_ the robe _off him and ˱they˲_dressed_ him _in the clothes ˱of˲_him, and ˱they˲_led_ him _away into the \add place\add* /to/_crucify \add him\add*.
\v 32 ¶ And coming_out, ˱they˲_found /a/_man /a/_Cyrenian, ˱by˲_/the/_name Simon. This \add one\add* ˱they˲_compelled that ˱he˲_/may/_carry the cross ˱of˲_him.
\v 33 And /having/_come to /a/_place /being/_called Golgotha, which is /being/_called Place ˱of˲_/the/_Skull”.
\v 34 ˱They˲_gave ˱to˲_him wine /having_been/_mixed with gall /to/_drink; and /having/_tasted \add it\add*, ˱he˲_> not <_willed /to/_drink \add it\add*.
\v 35 And /having/_crucified him, ˱they˲_divided the clothes ˱of˲_him casting /a/_lot,
\v 36 and sitting ˱they˲_/were/_guarding him there.
\v 37 And ˱they˲_put_on over the head ˱of˲_him the charge ˱of˲_him /having_been/_written, “this is \nd Jesus\nd*, the King ˱of˲_the Jews.”
\v 38 ¶ Then two robbers /are_being/_crucified with him, one on /the/_right, and one on /the/_left.
\v 39 And the \add ones\add* passing_through /were/_slandering him, shaking the heads ˱of˲_them
\v 40 and saying, “You tearing_down the temple and building \add it\add* in three days, save yourself, if ˱you˲_are /the/_son, - ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*, come_down from the cross!”
\v 41 Likewise the chief_priests with the scribes and elders mocking /were/_saying,
\v 42 “˱He˲_saved others, ˱he˲_/is/_=> not <=_able /to/_save himself. ˱He˲_Is King ˱of˲_Israel, /let/_˱him˲_come_down now from the cross, and ˱we˲_/will_be/_believing in him.
\v 43 ‘˱He˲_/has/_trusted in - \nd God\nd*, /let/_˱him˲_rescue now if ˱he˲_/is/_wanting him.’ For ˱he˲_said, - ‘˱I˲_am /the/_Son ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*.’”
\v 44 And the same also the robbers, the \add ones\add* /having_been/_crucified_with with him, /were/_deriding him.
\v 45 ¶ And from /the/_sixth hour, darkness became over all the land until /the/_hour ninth.
\v 46 And about the ninth hour, - \nd Jesus\nd* shouted ˱with˲_/a/_voice loud saying, “Eloi, Eloi, lema sabachthani?” This is, “\nd God\nd* ˱of˲_me, \nd God\nd* ˱of˲_me, for_ why _reason ˱you˲_abandoned me?”
\v 47 And some ˱of˲_the \add ones\add* /having/_stood there /having/_heard /were/_saying, - “This \add man\add* /is/_calling Elijah.”
\v 48 And immediately one of them /having/_run and /having/_taken /a/_sponge, and /having/_filled \add it\add* ˱with˲_wine_vinegar and /having/_put_around \add it\add* ˱around˲_/a/_reed, /was/_giving_ him _to_drink.
\v 49 But the rest /were/_saying, “Leave \add it\add*, ˱we˲_/may/_see whether Elijah /is/_coming /going_to/_save him.” and another /having/_taken /a/_spear pierced the side ˱of˲_him and water and blood came_out.
\v 50 And - \nd Jesus\nd* again /having/_cried_out ˱with˲_/a/_=> loud <=_voice, left his spirit.
\v 51 And behold, the curtain ˱of˲_the temple /was/_torn into two from top to bottom, and the earth /was/_shaken, and the rocks /were/_divided,
\v 52 and the tombs /were/_opened_up, and many bodies ˱of˲_the holy \add ones\add* /having_been/_fallen_asleep /was/_raised;
\v 53 and /having/_come_out out_of the tombs after the resurrection ˱of˲_him, ˱they˲_came_in into the holy city and /were/_manifested ˱to˲_many.
\v 54 And the centurion and the \add ones\add* with him guarding - \nd Jesus\nd*, /having/_seen the earthquake and the \add things\add* /having/_become, /were/_=> exceedingly <=_afraid saying, “Truly this \add one\add* was Son ˱of˲_\nd God\nd*.”
\v 55 ¶ And there were many women observing from afar, who followed - ˱after˲_\nd Jesus\nd* from - Galilee serving ˱unto˲_him,
\v 56 among whom was Mary the Magdalene, and Mary the mother - ˱of˲_Jacobus and ˱of˲_Joses, and the mother ˱of˲_the sons ˱of˲_Zebedee.
\v 57 ¶ And /having/_become evening, /a/_=> rich <=_man from Arimathea, namely Joseph, who also himself discipled - ˱to˲_\nd Jesus\nd* came.
\v 58 This \add one\add* /having/_approached - ˱to˲_Pilate, requested the body - ˱of˲_\nd Jesus\nd*. Then - Pilate commanded \add it\add* /to_be/_given_back.
\v 59 and /having/_taken the body, - Joseph wrapped it ˱in˲_/a/_=> clean <=_linen_cloth,
\v 60 and put it in the new tomb ˱of˲_him, which ˱he˲_hewn in the rock, and /having/_rolled /a/_=> great <=_stone ˱to˲_the door ˱of˲_the tomb, ˱he˲_went_away.
\v 61 And Mary the Magdalene was there and the other Mary, sitting in_front_of the tomb.
\v 62 ¶ And ˱on˲_the \add day\add* of_next, which is after the Preparation \add day\add*, the chief_priests and the Pharisees /were/_gathered_together to Pilate
\v 63 saying, “Sir, ˱we˲_/were/_reminded that that - deceiver still living said, ‘˱I˲_/am_being/_raised after three days.’
\v 64 Therefore command the tomb /to_be/_secured until the third day, lest the disciples /having/_come /may/_steal him and ˱they˲_/may/_say ˱to˲_the people, ‘˱He˲_/was/_raised from the dead’, and the last deception will_be worse \add than\add* the first.”
\v 65 And - Pilate /was/_saying ˱to˲_them, “˱You_all˲_/are/_having /a/_guard, /be/_going /to/_secure \add it\add* as ˱you_all˲_/have/_known.”
\v 66 And they /having_been/_gone secured the tomb, /having/_sealed the stone with the guard.
\c 28
\v 1 ¶ And after /the/_Sabbaths, ˱at˲_the \add time\add* dawning toward /the/_first \add day\add* ˱of˲_/the/_week, Mary the Magdalene and the other Mary came, /to/_observe the tomb.
\v 2 And behold, /an/_=> great <=_earthquake became; for /an/_angel ˱of˲_/the/_\nd Lord\nd* /having/_come_down from heaven and /having/_approached, rolled_away the stone and /was/_sitting on it.
\v 3 And the appearance ˱of˲_him was as lightning, and the clothing ˱of˲_him white as snow.
\v 4 And the \add ones\add* guarding /were/_shaken from the fear ˱of˲_him, and /were/_become as dead \add men\add*.
\v 5 And the angel answering said ˱to˲_the women, “/Be/_=> not <=_fearing you_all, for ˱I˲_/have/_known that ˱you_all˲_/are/_seeking \nd Jesus\nd*, the \add one\add* /having_been/_crucified.
\v 6 ˱He˲_is not here, for ˱he˲_/was/_raised as ˱he˲_said. Come see the place where ˱he˲_/was/_lying.
\v 7 And /having_been/_gone quickly, say ˱to˲_the disciples ˱of˲_him that ˱he˲_/was/_raised from the dead, and behold, ˱he˲_/is/_going_before you_all into - Galilee, ˱you_all˲_/will_be/_seeing him there. Behold, ˱I˲_told ˱to˲_you_all.”
\v 8 And /having/_gone_away quickly from the tomb, with fear and great joy, ˱they˲_ran /to/_report ˱to˲_the disciples ˱of˲_him.
\v 9 And behold, \nd Jesus\nd* met ˱with˲_them saying, “Hail!” And the \add women\add* /having/_approached, took_hold_of the feet ˱of˲_him and ˱they˲_worshipped ˱before˲_him.
\v 10 Then - \nd Jesus\nd* /is/_saying ˱to˲_them, “/Be/_=> not <=_fearing. /Be/_going report ˱to˲_the brothers ˱of˲_me that ˱they˲_/may/_go_away into - Galilee, and ˱they˲_/will_be/_seeing me there.”
\v 11 ¶ And them going, behold, some ˱of˲_the guard /having/_come into the city, reported ˱to˲_the chief_priests all the \add things\add* /having/_become.
\v 12 And /having_been/_gathered_together with the elders, and /having/_taken counsel, ˱they˲_gave many silver_coins ˱to˲_the soldiers
\v 13 saying, “Say -, ‘The disciples ˱of˲_him /having/_come ˱by˲_night stole him, ˱of˲_us falling_asleep.’
\v 14 And if this /may_be/_heard by the governor, we /will_be/_persuading \add him\add* and ˱we˲_/will_be/_making you_all unanxious.”
\v 15 And /having/_taken /the/_silver_coins they did as ˱they˲_/were/_taught. And - this word /was/_spread_abroad among /the/_Jews until the today
\v 16 ¶ But the /the/_eleven disciples /were/_gone into - Galilee, to the mountain where - \nd Jesus\nd* determined ˱for˲_them.
\v 17 And /having/_seen him ˱they˲_worshipped, but they doubted.
\v 18 And - \nd Jesus\nd* /having/_approached, spoke ˱to˲_them saying, all authority in heaven and on earth “/Was/_given ˱to˲_me.
\v 19 Therefore /having_been/_gone, disciple all the nations, baptizing them in the name ˱of˲_the Father, and ˱of˲_the Son, and ˱of˲_the Holy \nd Spirit\nd*,
\v 20 teaching them /to_be/_keeping all \add things\add* as_much_as ˱I˲_commanded ˱to˲_you_all. And behold, I am with you_all all the days, until the completion ˱of˲_the age.”
