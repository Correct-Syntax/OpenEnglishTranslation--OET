\is1 Introduction
\ip \bk The account of Ezra\bk*, is like a continuation of \bk The Chronicles\bk*. It's told here about the returning home of other Jews who had been taken to Babylon as captives, and the returning of living and worshipping in Yerushalem (Jerusalem). It's divided into three main sections: 1.) The declaration of King Koresh (Cyrus) of Persia (Heb. Paras) to allow a group of exiled Jews to return to Yerushalem from Babylon. 2.) The rebuilding of the temple and its dedication, and the return to worshipping Yahweh there in Yerushalem. 3.) XXX The returning home there to Yerushalem of that different e again group of Jews impanguluwan of Ezra, the one knowledgable of Law of God. He assisted the Israelis to return to their beliefs and customs, so that their worshipping of the true God wouldn't be forgotten.

\v 1 In the first year that Koresh \add (Cyrus¦217150)\add* was king of Persia¦217138 \add (Heb. Paras)\add*, Yahweh¦217142 stirred¦217145 up \add *his\add* spirit¦217149 in order¦217139 to fulfil¦217139 what \add *he'd\add* spoken through the prophet Yirmeyah \add (Jeremiah)\add*.\x + \xo 1:1: \xt Jer 25:11; 29:10.\x* \add ≈So¦217134\add* \add @the king\add* distributed a written proclamation¦217156 throughout his kingdom¦217159, saying,
\v 2 “Koresh¦217167, king¦217168 of Persia¦217169, declares this: Yahweh¦217175, the god¦217176 of heaven¦217177, has given¦217173 me all the kingdoms¦217171 in the world, and he's appointed¦217180 me to build¦217182 a residence for him in Yerushalem¦217186 in Yehudah¦217188.\x + \xo 1:2: \xt Isa 44:28.\x*
\v 3 Anyone among you who's one of his followers is free to go to Yerushalem (in Yehudah¦217202) \add to help\add* build¦217203 a temple there for Israel's¦217209 God Yahweh¦217207—the god of Yerushalem. May God go with you.
\v 4 Those who live near these people¦217227 but who're not going themselves, should donate gold¦217230 and silver¦217229, and goods¦217231 and livestock¦217232, plus cash as a voluntary offering¦217235 for God's temple in Yerushalem¦217239.

\p
\v 7 Then King Koresh brought out the equipment from Yahweh's temple that Nebuchadnezzar¦217294 had brought \add all the way\add* from Yerushalem¦217295 and had put in the house of his gods.
\v 8 \add *He\add* \add ≈put the treasurer¦217310 Mitedat in charge of bringing them out\add* and Sheshbatstsar, the ruler of Yehudah¦217314, \add ≈in charge of accepting them and listing them\add*.
\v 9 There were: thirty¦217320 gold¦217319 basins, one thousand¦217324 silver¦217323 basins, twenty-nine knives¦217325,
\v 10 thirty¦217332 gold¦217331 bowls, 410 silver¦217334 bowls, and a thousand¦217341 other¦217340 utensils,
\v 11 \add ≈coming to a total of 5,400 gold¦217347 and silver¦217348 utensils\add*. Sheshbatstsar¦217355 \add ≈took all of that with the group\add* of exiles¦217358 going from Babylon¦217359 to Yerushalem¦217360.
