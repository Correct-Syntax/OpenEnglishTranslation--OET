\v 1 This is Simon Peter (Grk: Simeon Petros¦151477), a slave¦151478 and messenger of Jesus the messiah (Grk: Yesou Christos), writing to those who have faith in the sinlessness of our God and saviour¦151497 Jesus Christ that's just as precious as our faith.
\p
\v 2 May you¦151502 experience much grace¦151501 and peace¦151504 through your knowledge¦151507 of God and Jesus our Lord.
\s1 The calling and peg-alam of God our
\p
\p
\v 3 He has given us everything necessary for life¦151530 and godliness through¦151534 his divine¦151522 power¦151523 as we know the one who called¦151538 us to his own glory¦151542 and moral excellence.
\v 4 Through these¦151563 things¦151563, he has given us precious¦151550 and very great¦151554 promises¦151558 that you will become¦151564 participants of the divine¦151565 nature¦151567 after escaping¦151569 the corruption¦151580 in the world¦151574 of lust.
\v 5 For this same¦151583 reason, work hard to apply your faith¦151595 adding moral excellence, and to that excellence add knowledge¦151604;
\v 6 to that knowledge¦151608 add self-control; to that self-control add endurance; to that endurance add godliness;
\v 7 to that godliness add brotherly concern; and to the brotherly concern add selfless love.
\v 8 Because if these¦151636 things¦151636 are part of you¦151638 and¦151641 continually increasing, your knowledge¦151656 of our Lord Jesus Christ won't become useless or unproductive.
\v 9 But if these¦151661 things¦151661 aren't part of someone, that person is shortsighted as if they've forgotten that prior cleansing of their sins¦151673.
\p
\v 10 So then fellow Christians, work hard to make your calling¦151688 and election certain—that way you will never fall away—
\v 11 and so you¦151704 will be richly¦151702 provided entry into the eternal¦151710 kingdom¦151712 of our¦151717 Lord and saviour¦151717 Jesus Christ.
\p
\p
\v 12 Therefore¦151721 I intend to always¦151727 remind¦151729 you about these¦151731 things¦151731, even though you know them and are already established in the truth¦151742 that you know.
\v 13 But I consider¦151745 it¦151745 right¦151743, as long as I live in this tent, to get you¦151754 stirred up with a reminder,
\v 14 since I know that this tent of mine will soon be left behind as our Lord Jesus Christ himself told me.
\v 15 And I will also make every effort to make sure that you¦151782 will always remember¦151789 these¦151788 things¦151788 after¦151783 my departure¦151786.
\p
\p
\v 16 We didn't follow¦151795 cleverly¦151793 crafted fables, but¦151807 rather having been eyewitnesses¦151808 of the majesty of our Lord Jesus Christ, we¦151796 made his power¦151804 and¦151805 forthcoming return known¦151796 to you¦151797.
\v 17 \x + \xo 1:17-18: \xt Mat 17:1-5; Mrk 9:2-7; Luk 9:28-35.\x*Because he received¦151814 the honour¦151820 and glory from {God the Father}=G when a voice¦151823 spoke to him with magnificent glory saying, “This is my son that I dearly love and who has pleased¦151845 me greatly.”
\v 18 Indeed we heard¦151852 this voice¦151850 from heaven¦151855 ourselves as we had been taken with him¦151859 to the holy mountain¦151866.
\p
\v 19 In addition there are the words of the prophets¦151871 that were fulfilled which you would do well to pay attention to—like a light that shines in the dark places¦151882—until¦151883 the day¦151886 dawns and the one who is the morning¦151889 star¦151889 rises in your hearts¦151893.
\v 20 And know this foundational truth: all of the prophecy¦151900 in Scripture doesn't just come from our own interpretations¦151905
\v 21 or from the ideas of man¦151911, but¦151917 from God speaking via men being¦151921 guided by the Holy Spirit.
\c 2
\s1 The teachers of not true/correct
\p
\p
\v 1 But just like there were also false prophets¦151933 among the people¦151936, so also there will be false teachers¦151942 among you¦151940 who will sneakily¦151944 bring¦151953 in destructive heresies—even denying the Master and thus bringing¦151953 swift destruction upon themselves¦151955.
\v 2 Many people will follow¦151960 their gross immorality causing evil to be spoken of about the true way¦151969.
\v 3 They will exploit you¦151978 with greed¦151975 and made-up words but the judgment¦151985 of old won't be idle and their destroyer¦151992 won't be sleeping.
\p
\p
\v 4 Because if God=G didn't spare¦152004 the angels¦152001 when they sinned¦152002, but¦152005 chained them in darkness¦152008 and kept¦152014 them to be delivered to judgement in due course,
\v 5 \x + \xo 2:5: \xt Gen 6:1–7:24.\x* and¦152018 if he=G didn't spare¦152022 the ancient¦152019 world but¦152023 only preserved¦152028 the eight¦152024 including Noah¦152025 the proclaimer¦152027 of righteousness¦152026 when the flood¦152029 came upon the ungodly¦152032 world,
\v 6 \x + \xo 2:6: \xt Gen 19:24.\x*and if he¦152035 reduced¦152040 the cities¦152035 of Sodom¦152036 and Gomorrah¦152038 to ashes¦152040 by a catastrophe which condemned¦152042 them to being an example¦152043 of what the ungodly¦152048 will become,
\v 7 \x + \xo 2:7: \xt Gen 19:1-16.\x*and if he saved the righteous¦152052 man Lot¦152053 who was distressed¦152054 by the gross immorality of the lawless¦152059 people
\v 8 and whose righteous soul was tormented¦152081 by seeing¦152065 and hearing¦152068 their lawlessness¦152079 day after day,
\v 9 then the Lord knows how to rescue¦152088 godly people from their trials, and knows how to keep the unrighteous¦152090 people to be punished¦152097 at the day¦152095 of judgement,
\v 10 especially those who follow their fleshly¦152103 lusts¦152105 that defile¦152108 themselves and despise¦152112 his Lordship.
\p Those bold, self-willed¦152115 people don't worry about insulting the glorious¦152116 ones,
\v 11 whereas¦152121 even angels¦152122 who are greater¦152127 in both strength¦152123 and¦152124 power¦152125 don't slander¦152137 or pass the Lord's judgement on those glorious ones.
\v 12 But these¦152139 men act like unthinking animals¦152144 that are born to be captured¦152150 and destroyed when they slander¦152157 concerning things¦152154 they know nothing about, and they will bring about their own destruction.
\v 13 The harm they did will lead to their own harm as payment as their indulgence in broad daylight. They've become spots and¦152181 blemishes¦152182 as they feast¦152190 together with you¦152191 yet take joy in their deception.
\v 14 Their eyes¦152192 are full of lust for adultery¦152195 and never cease to sin¦152199, and having trained¦152205 their hearts¦152204 in greed¦152206 they entice¦152201 unstable¦152203 people to become their cursed¦152209 offspring.
\v 15 \x + \xo 2:15-16: \xt Num 22:4-35.\x*They have left the right path and gone astray, following¦152216 the path of Balaam the son of Bosor¦152222 who loved¦152227 the wages of unrighteousness¦152226,
\v 16 but he was scolded for his sin when a normally dumb donkey¦152234 spoke¦152240 to him with a man's voice¦152239 to stop his madness.
\p
\p
\v 17 These¦152246 men are like waterless¦152249 fountains and like mists¦152251 driven¦152255 by storms¦152254, and the gloomy darkness is reserved for them
\v 18 because they¦152269 speak¦152268 vane and inflated words to entice¦152269 people to fleshly¦152272 lusts¦152271. Those who have just escaped¦152278 from the errors of their living
\v 19 are promised¦152288 freedom¦152286, but they themselves have become slaves¦152290 to corruption¦152294, because whatever a person has been defeated by is what they become a slave¦152290 to.
\v 20 Because if they have escaped¦152304 the defilements¦152306 of the world¦152308 by their knowledge¦152310 of our Lord and saviour¦152315 Jesus Christ and yet get entangled¦152321 again¦152320, they are defeated and have ended up worse¦152328 off than at the beginning.
\v 21 It would have been better¦152331 not to have known the way of righteousness¦152343, than having known it and to turn¦152350 back from the holy instruction that was passed on to them.
\v 22 \x + \xo 2:22: \xt Prv 26:11.\x*The proverb¦152366 is correct in what it¦152372 says and has happened¦152359 to them: “A dog returns¦152368 to its¦152370 own vomit¦152372,” and “A sow that's been washed¦152375 wallows¦152377 in the mud again.”

\s1 The return of Jesus the messiah
\p
\p
\v 1 This is now my second¦152383 letter¦152386 to you my friends—both of which¦152388 were sent as reminders to stir up your minds to sincerely¦152395
\v 2 remember the words spoken¦152399 in the past by the holy prophets¦152404 as well as the instruction of the Lord and saviour¦152415 that came via your apostles.
\v 3 \x + \xo 3:3: \xt Hud 18.\x*Firstly you should know that mockers¦152431 will come during the last days¦152428, scoffing, following their¦152433 own lusts¦152436
\v 4 and¦152439 saying¦152440, “What about his promised¦152444 return? Everything has just continued¦152456 as usual from the beginning¦152458 of creation¦152459 right past the time¦152449 when the ancestors died.
\v 5 \x + \xo 3:5: \xt Gen 1:6-9.\x*But because of their desires, the truth is hidden from them that the universe came into being long ago by God's word and the earth¦152471 was formed out of water and through¦152475 water
\v 6 \x + \xo 3:6: \xt Gen 7:11.\x*and these same waters¦152490 deluged the ancient world¦152489 which¦152485 then perished¦152492.
\v 7 But the present universe and the earth¦152499 have been preserved by that same¦152502 word to be kept¦152508 for fire¦152507 in the day¦152510 of judgement and destruction¦152514 of those who are ungodly¦152516.
\p
\p
\v 8 \x + \xo 3:8: \xt Psa 90:4.\x*But don't let this one thing escape¦152522 your attention my dear friends, that one day for us is like a thousand years with the Lord, and a thousand years is like one day.
\v 9 The Lord isn't slow in fulfilling his promise¦152546 as some consider¦152550 slowness¦152549, but is patient¦152552 toward¦152554 you¦152555—not wanting anyone to perish¦152561 but rather wanting everyone to come to repentance¦152566.
\p
\v 10 \x + \xo 3:10: \xt Mat 24:43; Luk 12:39; 1Tis 5:2; Rev 16:15.\x*But the day¦152571 of the Lord will come like a thief¦152574, when the universe will suddenly pass away, its components will burn up and be destroyed¦152587, and the earth¦152591 and what happened on it¦152595 will be examined.
\v 11 Since all these¦152602 things¦152602 will be destroyed¦152608, what kind of people¦152609 should you¦152612 be? Holy and¦152618 godly in conduct¦152617,
\v 12 waiting for and hastening the coming¦152624 of the day¦152629 of God when the universe will be set alight and destroyed¦152634 and its components will melt as they burn up.
\v 13 \x + \xo 3:13: \xt Isa 65:17; 66:22; Rev 21:1.\x*But we¦152656 await a new universe and¦152644 a new earth¦152646 filled with righteousness¦152659 according¦152650 to his promise¦152653.
\p
\p
\v 14 And so dear friends, while you await these¦152664 events be eager and found¦152673 to be at peace¦152675 with him¦152672—spotless¦152668 and blameless¦152671.
\v 15 And consider¦152683 the patience¦152681 of our Lord as leading to salvation¦152682 as our dear brother¦152690 Paul wrote¦152698 to you¦152699 using the wisdom¦152697 that has been given¦152695 to him¦152696.
\v 16 He speaks¦152706 in all his letters¦152705 concerning¦152710 these¦152711 things, some of which are hard to understand¦152717 and which ignorant¦152721 and unstable¦152723 people twist just like they twist the other¦152729 scriptures¦152730 to their¦152732 own destruction¦152736.
\p
\v 17 So knowing¦152740 this in advance dear friends, guard¦152743 yourselves in case you fall from your own stable position with the same errors as the lawless¦152748 ones.
\v 18 Rather grow in the grace¦152760 and knowledge¦152762 of our¦152767 Lord and saviour¦152767 Kesus Christ. May the glory¦152772 be his, both now and through the days of eternity¦152778. Amen.
