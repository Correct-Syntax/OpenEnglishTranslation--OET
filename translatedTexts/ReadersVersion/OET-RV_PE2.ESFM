\v 1 This is Simon Peter (Grk: Simeon Petros¦151478), a slave¦151479 and messenger of Yeshua the messiah (Grk: Yesou Christos), writing to those who have faith in the sinlessness of our God¦151495 and saviour¦151498 Yeshua Christ that's just as precious as our faith.
\p
\v 2 May you¦151503 experience much grace¦151502 and peace¦151505 through your¦151512 knowledge¦151508 of God¦151510 and Yeshua¦151512 our¦151512 Lord.
\s1 The calling and peg-alam of God our
\p
\p
\v 3 He has given us everything necessary for life¦151531 and godliness through¦151535 his divine¦151523 power¦151524 as we know the one who called¦151539 us to his own glory¦151543 and moral excellence.
\v 4 Through these¦151564 things¦151564, he has given us precious¦151551 and very great¦151555 promises¦151559 that you will become¦151565 participants of the divine¦151566 nature¦151568 after escaping¦151570 the corruption¦151581 in the world¦151575 of lust.
\v 5 For this same¦151584 reason, work hard to apply your¦151597 faith¦151596 adding moral excellence, and to that excellence add knowledge¦151605;
\v 6 to that knowledge¦151609 add self-control; to that self-control add endurance; to that endurance add godliness;
\v 7 to that godliness add brotherly concern; and to the brotherly concern add selfless love.
\v 8 Because if these¦151637 things¦151637 are part of you¦151639 and¦151642 continually increasing, your¦151654 knowledge¦151657 of our¦151654 Lord Yeshua¦151655 Christ won't become useless or unproductive.
\v 9 But if these¦151662 things¦151662 aren't part of someone, that person is shortsighted as if they've forgotten that prior cleansing of their¦151672 sins¦151674.
\p
\v 10 So then fellow Christians, work hard to make your¦151686 calling¦151689 and election certain—that way you will never fall away—
\v 11 and so you¦151705 will be richly¦151703 provided entry into the eternal¦151711 kingdom¦151713 of our¦151718 Lord and saviour¦151718 Yeshua¦151720 Christ.
\p
\p
\v 12 Therefore¦151722 I intend to always¦151728 remind¦151730 you about these¦151732 things¦151732, even though you know them and are already established in the truth¦151743 that you know.
\v 13 But I consider¦151746 it¦151746 right¦151744, as long as I live in this tent, to get you¦151755 stirred up with a reminder,
\v 14 since I know that this tent of mine will soon be left behind as our¦151768 Lord Yeshua¦151774 Christ himself told me.
\v 15 And I will also make every effort to make sure that you¦151783 will always remember¦151790 these¦151789 things¦151789 after¦151784 my departure¦151787.
\p
\p
\v 16 We didn't follow¦151796 cleverly¦151794 crafted fables, but¦151808 rather having been eyewitnesses¦151809 of the majesty of our¦151802 Lord Yeshua¦151803 Christ, we¦151797 made his¦151802 power¦151805 and¦151806 forthcoming return known¦151797 to you¦151798.
\v 17 \x + \xo 1:17-18: \xt Mat 17:1-5; Mrk 9:2-7; Luk 9:28-35.\x*Because he received¦151815 the honour¦151821 and glory from {God the Father}=G when a voice¦151824 spoke to him with magnificent glory saying, “This is my¦151837 son that I dearly love and who has pleased¦151846 me greatly.”
\v 18 Indeed we heard¦151853 this voice¦151851 from heaven¦151856 ourselves as we had been taken with him¦151860 to the holy mountain¦151867.
\p
\v 19 In addition there are the words of the prophets¦151872 that were fulfilled which you would do well to pay attention to—like a light that shines in the dark places¦151883—until¦151884 the day¦151887 dawns and the one who is the morning¦151890 star¦151890 rises in your¦151895 hearts¦151894.
\v 20 And know this foundational truth: all of the prophecy¦151901 in Scripture doesn't just come from our¦151905 own interpretations¦151906
\v 21 or from the ideas of man¦151912, but¦151918 from God¦151928 speaking via men being¦151922 guided by the Holy Spirit.
\c 2
\s1 The teachers of not true/correct
\p
\p
\v 1 But just like there were also false prophets¦151934 among the people¦151937, so also there will be false teachers¦151943 among you¦151941 who will sneakily¦151945 bring in destructive heresies—even denying the Master and thus bringing¦151954 swift destruction upon themselves¦151956.
\v 2 Many people will follow¦151961 their¦151962 gross immorality causing evil to be spoken of about the true way¦151970.
\v 3 They will exploit you¦151979 with greed¦151976 and made-up words but the judgment¦151986 of old won't be idle and their¦151994 destroyer¦151993 won't be sleeping.
\p
\p
\v 4 Because if God=G didn't spare¦152005 the angels¦152002 when they sinned¦152003, but¦152006 chained them in darkness¦152009 and kept¦152015 them to be delivered to judgement in due course,
\v 5 \x + \xo 2:5: \xt Gen 6:1–7:24.\x* and¦152019 if he=G didn't spare¦152023 the ancient¦152020 world but¦152024 only preserved¦152029 the eight¦152025 including Noah¦152026 the proclaimer¦152028 of righteousness¦152027 when the flood¦152030 came upon the ungodly¦152033 world,
\v 6 \x + \xo 2:6: \xt Gen 19:24.\x*and if he¦152036 reduced¦152041 the cities¦152036 of Sodom¦152037 and Gomorrah¦152039 to ashes¦152041 by a catastrophe which condemned¦152043 them to being an example¦152044 of what the ungodly¦152049 will become,
\v 7 \x + \xo 2:7: \xt Gen 19:1-16.\x*and if he saved the righteous¦152053 man Lot¦152054 who was distressed¦152055 by the gross immorality of the lawless¦152060 people
\v 8 and whose righteous soul was tormented¦152082 by seeing¦152066 and hearing¦152069 their lawlessness¦152080 day after day,
\v 9 then the Lord knows how to rescue¦152089 godly people from their¦152097 trials, and knows how to keep the unrighteous¦152091 people to be punished¦152098 at the day¦152096 of judgement,
\v 10 especially those who follow their¦152109 fleshly¦152104 lusts¦152106 that defile¦152109 themselves and despise¦152113 his¦152109 Lordship.
\p Those bold, self-willed¦152116 people don't worry about insulting the glorious¦152117 ones,
\v 11 whereas¦152122 even angels¦152123 who are greater¦152128 in both strength¦152124 and¦152125 power¦152126 don't slander¦152138 or pass the Lord's judgement on those glorious ones.
\v 12 But these¦152140 men act like unthinking animals¦152145 that are born to be captured¦152151 and destroyed when they slander¦152158 concerning things¦152155 they know nothing about, and they will bring about their¦152163 own destruction.
\v 13 The harm they did will lead to their own harm as payment as their indulgence in broad daylight. They've become spots and¦152182 blemishes¦152183 as they feast¦152191 together with you¦152192 yet take joy in their deception.
\v 14 Their¦152210 eyes¦152193 are full of lust for adultery¦152196 and never cease to sin¦152200, and having trained¦152206 their hearts¦152205 in greed¦152207 they entice¦152202 unstable¦152204 people to become their cursed¦152210 offspring.
\v 15 \x + \xo 2:15-16: \xt Num 22:4-35.\x*They have left the right path and gone astray, following¦152217 the path of Balaam the son of Bosor¦152223 who loved¦152228 the wages of unrighteousness¦152227,
\v 16 but he was scolded for his sin when a normally dumb donkey¦152235 spoke¦152241 to him with a man's voice¦152240 to stop his madness.
\p
\p
\v 17 These¦152247 men are like waterless¦152250 fountains and like mists¦152252 driven¦152256 by storms¦152255, and the gloomy darkness is reserved for them
\v 18 because they¦152270 speak¦152269 vane and inflated words to entice¦152270 people to fleshly¦152273 lusts¦152272. Those who have just escaped¦152279 from the errors of their¦152273 living
\v 19 are promised¦152289 freedom¦152287, but they themselves have become slaves¦152291 to corruption¦152295, because whatever a person has been defeated by is what they become a slave to.
\v 20 Because if they have escaped¦152305 the defilements¦152307 of the world¦152309 by their¦152312 knowledge¦152311 of our¦152312 Lord and saviour¦152316 Yeshua¦152317 Christ and yet get entangled¦152322 again¦152321, they are defeated and have ended up worse¦152329 off than at the beginning.
\v 21 It would have been better¦152332 not to have known the way of righteousness¦152344, than having known it and to turn back from the holy instruction that was passed on to them.
\v 22 \x + \xo 2:22: \xt Prv 26:11.\x*The proverb¦152367 is correct in what it¦152373 says and has happened¦152360 to them: “A dog returns¦152369 to its¦152371 own vomit¦152373,” and “A sow that's been washed¦152376 wallows¦152378 in the mud again.”

\s1 The return of Yeshua the messiah
\p
\p
\v 1 This is now my second¦152384 letter¦152387 to you my friends—both of which¦152389 were sent as reminders to stir up your¦152391 minds to sincerely¦152396
\v 2 remember the words spoken¦152400 in the past by the holy prophets¦152405 as well as the instruction of the Lord and saviour¦152416 that came via your¦152407 apostles.
\v 3 \x + \xo 3:3: \xt Hud 18.\x*Firstly you should know that mockers¦152432 will come during the last days¦152429, scoffing, following their¦152434 own lusts¦152437
\v 4 and¦152440 saying¦152441, “What about his¦152448 promised¦152445 return? Everything has just continued¦152457 as usual from the beginning¦152459 of creation¦152460 right past the time¦152450 when the ancestors died.
\v 5 \x + \xo 3:5: \xt Gen 1:6-9.\x*But because of their¦152483 desires, the truth is hidden from them that the universe came into being long ago by God's word and the earth¦152472 was formed out of water and through¦152476 water
\v 6 \x + \xo 3:6: \xt Gen 7:11.\x*and these same waters¦152491 deluged the ancient world¦152490 which¦152486 then perished¦152493.
\v 7 But the present universe and the earth¦152500 have been preserved by that same¦152503 word to be kept¦152509 for fire¦152508 in the day¦152511 of judgement and destruction¦152515 of those who are ungodly¦152517.
\p
\p
\v 8 \x + \xo 3:8: \xt Psa 90:4.\x*But don't let this one thing escape¦152523 your attention my dear friends, that one day for us is like a thousand years with the Lord, and a thousand years is like one day.
\v 9 The Lord isn't slow in fulfilling his promise¦152547 as some consider¦152551 slowness¦152550, but is patient¦152553 toward¦152555 you¦152556—not wanting anyone to perish¦152562 but rather wanting everyone to come to repentance¦152567.
\p
\v 10 \x + \xo 3:10: \xt Mat 24:43; Luk 12:39; 1Tis 5:2; Rev 16:15.\x*But the day¦152572 of the Lord will come like a thief¦152575, when the universe will suddenly pass away, its components will burn up and be destroyed¦152588, and the earth¦152592 and what happened on it¦152596 will be examined.
\v 11 Since all these¦152603 things¦152603 will be destroyed¦152609, what kind of people¦152610 should you¦152613 be? Holy and¦152619 godly in conduct¦152618,
\v 12 waiting for and hastening the coming¦152625 of the day¦152630 of God¦152628 when the universe will be set alight and destroyed¦152635 and its components will melt as they burn up.
\v 13 \x + \xo 3:13: \xt Isa 65:17; 66:22; Rev 21:1.\x*But we¦152657 await a new universe and¦152645 a new earth filled with righteousness¦152660 according¦152651 to his¦152656 promise¦152654.
\p
\p
\v 14 And so dear friends, while you await these¦152665 events be eager and found¦152674 to be at peace¦152676 with him¦152673—spotless¦152669 and blameless¦152672.
\v 15 And consider¦152684 the patience¦152682 of our Lord as leading to salvation¦152683 as our dear brother¦152691 Paul¦152692 wrote¦152699 to you¦152700 using the wisdom¦152698 that has been given¦152696 to him¦152697.
\v 16 He speaks¦152707 in all his letters¦152706 concerning¦152711 these¦152712 things, some of which are hard to understand¦152718 and which ignorant¦152722 and unstable¦152724 people twist just like they twist the other¦152730 scriptures¦152731 to their¦152733 own destruction¦152737.
\p
\v 17 So knowing¦152741 this in advance dear friends, guard¦152744 yourselves in case you fall from your own stable position with the same errors as the lawless¦152749 ones.
\v 18 Rather grow in the grace¦152761 and knowledge¦152763 of our¦152768 Lord and saviour¦152768 Kesus Christ. May the glory¦152773 be his¦152766, both now and through the days of eternity¦152779. Amen.
