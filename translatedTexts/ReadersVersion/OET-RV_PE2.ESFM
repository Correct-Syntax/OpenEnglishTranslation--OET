\mt2 The first letter from
\mt1 Simon ‘the Rock’ (Peter)
\is1 Introduction
\ip \bk The second letter from Simon ‘Peter’\bk* was sent to believers in various towns of Asia Minor (also called Anatolia, now part of modern Turkey) (1 Peter 1:1, 2 Peter 3:1). His purpose of writing this was to contradict the work of false teachers, and to scold the people for their bad behaviour as a result of following that teaching. Therefore he encouraged them to not believe that teaching because they should only believe the teaching concerning the messiah. They also need to be adding the following to their faith: good behaviour, wisdom/knowledge, self-control, patience, obeying God, and loving others.
\ip Those people taught that the messiah would not return since it had already been quite a while and he hadn't yet returned. But Simon answered by saying that the messiah would certainly return, but God doesn't want to punish everyone, but desires that people would turn away from their sins.

\rem /s1 Salutation; Greetings from Peter
\p
\v 1 This \add letter is from\add* Simon¦151451 Peter (Grk: Simeon Petros¦151453), a slave¦151454 and messenger of Yeshua the \nd messiah¦151458\nd* (Grk: Yesou Christos), writing to those who have faith in the sinlessness of our \nd God¦151470\nd* and saviour¦151473 Yeshua \nd Messiah¦151458\nd* that's just as precious as our faith.
\p
\v 2 May you¦151478 experience much grace¦151477 and peace¦151480 through your knowledge¦151483 of \nd God¦151485\nd* and \nd Yeshua¦151487\nd* our¦151491 Lord.
\s1 God's calling
\rem /s1 Growing in the Knowledge of God; The Christian's Call and Election; Making One's Calling and Election Sure; God's Call and Choice; Living in the last days
\p
\v 3 He has given us everything necessary for life¦151506 and godliness through¦151510 his divine¦151498 power¦151499 as we know¦151512 the one who called¦151514 us to his own glory¦151518 and moral excellence.
\v 4 Through these¦151539 things, he has given us precious¦151526 and very great¦151530 promises¦151534 that you will become¦151540 participants of the divine¦151541 nature¦151543 after escaping¦151545 the corruption¦151556 in the world¦151550 of lust.
\v 5 For this same¦151559 reason, work hard to apply your¦151572 faith¦151571 adding moral excellence, and to that excellence add knowledge¦151580;
\v 6 to that knowledge¦151584 add self-control; to that self-control add endurance; to that endurance add godliness;
\v 7 to that godliness add brotherly concern; and to the brotherly concern add selfless love.
\v 8 Because if these¦151612 things are part of you¦151614 and¦151617 continually increasing, your knowledge¦151632 of our¦151629 Lord \nd Yeshua¦151630 Messiah¦151631\nd* won't become useless or unproductive.
\v 9 But if these¦151637 things aren't part of someone, that person is shortsighted as if they've forgotten that prior cleansing of their sins¦151649.
\p
\v 10 So¦151650 then fellow Christians, work hard to make your¦151661 calling¦151664 and election certain—that way you will never fall away—
\v 11 and so you¦151680 will be richly¦151678 provided entry into the eternal¦151686 kingdom¦151688 of our¦151691 Lord and saviour¦151693 \nd Yeshua¦151695 Messiah¦151696\nd*.
\rem /s1 Paying Attention to Scripture; Prophecy of Scripture
\p
\v 12 Therefore¦151697 I intend to always¦151703 remind¦151705 you about these¦151707 things, even though you know them and are already established in the truth¦151718 that you know.
\v 13 But I consider¦151721 it¦151721 right¦151719, as long as I live in this tent, to get you¦151730 stirred up with a reminder,
\v 14 since I know that this tent of mine will soon be left behind as our¦151748 Lord \nd Yeshua¦151749 Messiah¦151750\nd* himself told me.
\v 15 And I will also make every effort to make sure that you¦151758 will always remember¦151765 these¦151764 things after¦151759 my departure¦151762.
\rem /s1 Eyewitnesses of Christ's Glory
\p
\v 16 We didn't follow¦151771 cleverly¦151769 crafted fables, but¦151783 rather having been eyewitnesses¦151784 of the majesty of our¦151777 Lord \nd Yeshua¦151778 Messiah¦151779\nd*, we¦151772 made his power¦151780 and¦151781 forthcoming return known¦151772 to you¦151773.
\v 17 \x + \xo 1:17-18: \xt Mat 17:1-5; Mrk 9:2-7; Luk 9:28-35.\x*Because he received¦151790 the honour¦151796 and glory from \nd God¦151794\nd* the Father when a voice¦151799 spoke to him with magnificent glory saying, “This is my¦151812 son that I dearly love and who has pleased¦151821 me greatly.”
\v 18 Indeed we heard¦151828 this voice¦151826 from heaven¦151831 ourselves as we had been taken with him¦151835 to the holy mountain¦151842.
\p
\v 19 In addition there are the words of the prophets¦151847 that were fulfilled which you would do well to pay attention to—like a light that shines in the dark places¦151858—until¦151859 the day¦151862 dawns and the one who is the morning¦151865 star¦151865 rises in your¦151870 hearts¦151869.
\v 20 And know this foundational truth: all of the prophecy¦151876 in Scripture doesn't just come from our own interpretations¦151881
\v 21 or from the ideas of man, but¦151893 from \nd God¦151903\nd* speaking via men being¦151897 guided by the Holy Spirit.

\s1 False teachers
\rem /s1 God's judgement on false teaching; The Danger of False Teachers; False Teachers; False Teachers and Their Destruction; False Prophets and Their Punishment
\p
\v 1 But just like there were also false prophets¦151909 among the people¦151912, so also there will be false teachers¦151918 among you¦151916 who will sneakily¦151920 bring in destructive heresies—even denying the Master¦151927 and thus bringing¦151929 swift destruction upon themselves¦151931.
\v 2 Many people will follow¦151936 their¦151937 gross immorality causing evil to be spoken of about the true way¦151945.
\v 3 They will exploit you¦151954 with greed¦151951 and made-up words but the judgment¦151961 of old won't be idle and their¦151969 destroyer¦151968 won't be sleeping.
\p
\v 4 Because if \nd God¦151976\nd* didn't spare¦151980 the messengers¦151977 when they sinned¦151978, but¦151981 chained them in darkness¦151984 and kept¦151990 them to be delivered to judgement in due course,
\v 5 \x + \xo 2:5: \xt Gen 6:1–7:24.\x*and if he didn't spare¦151998 the ancient¦151995 world but only preserved¦152004 the eight¦152000 including Noah¦152001 the proclaimer¦152003 of righteousness¦152002 when the flood¦152005 came upon the ungodly¦152008 world,
\v 6 \x + \xo 2:6: \xt Gen 19:24.\x*and if he reduced¦152016 the cities¦152011 of Sodom¦152012 and Gomorrah¦152014 to ashes¦152016 by a catastrophe which condemned¦152018 them to being an example¦152019 of what the ungodly¦152024 will become,
\v 7 \x + \xo 2:7: \xt Gen 19:1-16.\x*and if he saved the righteous¦152028 man Lot¦152029 who was distressed¦152030 by the gross immorality of the lawless¦152035 people
\v 8 and whose righteous soul was tormented¦152057 by seeing¦152041 and hearing¦152044 their lawlessness¦152055 day after day,
\v 9 then the Lord knows how to rescue¦152064 godly¦152060 people from their trials, and knows how to keep the unrighteous¦152066 people to be punished¦152073 at the day¦152071 of judgement,
\v 10 especially those who follow their fleshly¦152079 lusts¦152081 that defile¦152084 themselves and despise¦152088 his Lordship.
\p Those bold, self-willed¦152091 people don't¦152094 worry about insulting¦152096 the glorious¦152092 ones,
\v 11 whereas¦152097 even messengers¦152098 who are greater¦152103 in both strength¦152099 and¦152100 power¦152101 don't¦152105 slander¦152112 or pass the Lord's judgement on those glorious ones.
\v 12 But these¦152114 men act like unthinking animals¦152119 that are born to be captured¦152125 and destroyed when they slander¦152132 concerning things they know nothing about, and they will bring about their¦152137 own destruction.
\v 13 The harm they did will lead to their own harm as payment as their indulgence in broad daylight. They've become spots and¦152156 blemishes¦152157 as they feast¦152165 together with you¦152166 yet take joy in their deception.
\v 14 Their eyes¦152167 are full of lust for adultery¦152170 and never cease to sin¦152174, and having trained¦152180 their hearts¦152179 in greed¦152181 they entice¦152176 unstable¦152178 people to become their cursed¦152184 offspring.
\v 15 \x + \xo 2:15-16: \xt Num 22:4-35.\x*They have left the right path and gone astray, following¦152191 the path of Balaam the son of Bosor¦152197 who loved¦152202 the wages of unrighteousness¦152201,
\v 16 but he was scolded for his sin when a normally dumb donkey¦152209 spoke¦152215 to him with a man's voice¦152214 to stop his madness.
\p
\v 17 These¦152221 men are like waterless¦152224 fountains and like mists¦152226 driven¦152230 by storms¦152229, and the gloomy darkness is reserved for them
\v 18 because they¦152244 speak¦152243 vane and inflated words to entice¦152244 people to fleshly¦152247 lusts¦152246. Those who have just escaped¦152253 from the errors of their living
\v 19 are promised¦152263 freedom¦152261, but they themselves have become slaves¦152265 to corruption¦152269, because¦152271 whatever a person has been defeated by is what they become a slave to.
\v 20 Because if they have escaped¦152279 the defilements¦152281 of the world¦152283 by their knowledge¦152285 of our Lord and saviour¦152290 \nd Yeshua¦152291 Messiah¦152292\nd* and yet get entangled¦152296 again¦152295, they are defeated and have ended up worse¦152303 off than at the beginning.
\v 21 It would have been better¦152306 not to have known the way of righteousness¦152318, than having known it and to turn back from the holy instruction that was passed on to them.
\v 22 \x + \xo 2:22: \xt Prv 26:11.\x*The proverb¦152341 is correct in what it says and has happened¦152334 to them: “A dog returns¦152343 to its¦152345 own vomit¦152347,” and “A sow that's been washed¦152350 wallows¦152352 in the mud again.”

\p
\v 1 This is now my second¦152358 letter¦152361 to you my friends—both of which¦152363 were sent as reminders to stir up your¦152365 minds to sincerely¦152370
\v 2 remember the words spoken¦152374 in the past by the holy prophets¦152379 as well as the instruction of the Lord and saviour¦152390 that came via your¦152384 apostles.
\v 3 \x + \xo 3:3: \xt Jude 18.\x*Firstly you should know that mockers¦152406 will come during the last days¦152403, scoffing, following their¦152408 own lusts¦152411
\v 4 and¦152414 saying¦152415, “What about his¦152422 promised¦152419 return? Everything has just continued¦152431 as usual from the beginning¦152433 of creation¦152434 right past the time¦152424 when the ancestors¦152427 died.
\v 5 \x + \xo 3:5: \xt Gen 1:6-9.\x*But because of their desires, the truth is hidden from them that the universe came into being long ago by God's word and the earth¦152446 was formed out of water and through¦152450 water
\v 6 \x + \xo 3:6: \xt Gen 7:11.\x*and these same waters¦152465 deluged the ancient world¦152464 which¦152460 then perished¦152467.
\v 7 But the present universe and the earth¦152474 have been preserved by that same¦152477 word to be kept¦152483 for fire¦152482 in the day¦152485 of judgement and destruction¦152489 of those who are ungodly¦152491.
\p
\v 8 \x + \xo 3:8: \xt Psa 90:4.\x*But don't¦152496 let this one thing escape¦152497 your attention my dear friends, that one day for us is like a thousand years with the Lord, and a thousand years is like one day.
\v 9 The Lord isn't slow in fulfilling his promise¦152521 as some consider¦152525 slowness¦152524, but is patient¦152527 toward¦152529 you¦152530—not wanting anyone to perish¦152536 but rather wanting everyone to come to repentance¦152541.
\p
\v 10 \x + \xo 3:10: \xt Mat 24:43; Luk 12:39; 1Th 5:2; Rev 16:15.\x*But the day¦152546 of the Lord will come like a thief¦152549, when the universe will suddenly pass away, its components will burn up and be destroyed¦152562, and the earth¦152566 and what happened on it¦152570 will be examined.
\v 11 Since all these¦152577 things will be destroyed¦152583, what kind of people¦152584 should you¦152587 be? Holy and¦152593 godly in conduct¦152592,
\v 12 waiting for and hastening the coming¦152599 of the day¦152604 of \nd God¦152602\nd* when the universe will be set alight and destroyed¦152609 and its components will melt as they burn up.
\v 13 \x + \xo 3:13: \xt Isa 65:17; 66:22; Rev 21:1.\x*But we¦152631 await a new universe and¦152619 a new earth¦152621 filled with righteousness¦152634 according¦152625 to his¦152630 promise¦152628.

\v 15 And consider¦152658 the patience¦152656 of our Lord as leading to salvation¦152657 as our dear brother¦152665 Paul¦152666 wrote¦152673 to you¦152674 using the wisdom¦152672 that has been given¦152670 to him¦152671.
\v 16 He speaks¦152681 in all his letters¦152680 concerning¦152685 these¦152686 things, some of which are hard to understand¦152692 and which ignorant¦152696 and unstable¦152698 people twist just like they twist the other¦152704 scriptures¦152705 to their¦152707 own destruction¦152711.
\rem /s1 Peter's Final Words

\v 17 So¦152713 knowing¦152715 this in advance dear friends, guard¦152718 yourselves in case you fall from your own stable position with the same errors as the lawless¦152723 ones.
\v 18 Rather grow in the grace¦152735 and knowledge¦152737 of our¦152740 Lord and saviour¦152742 \nd Yeshua¦152743 Messiah¦152744\nd*. May the glory¦152747 be his, both now and through the days of eternity¦152753. Amen.
