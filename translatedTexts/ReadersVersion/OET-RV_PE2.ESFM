\rem /s1 Salutation; Greetings from Peter
\p
\p
\v 1 This is Simon¦151450 Peter (Grk: Simeon Petros¦151452), a slave¦151453 and messenger of Yeshua the messiah (Grk: Yesou Christos), writing to those who have faith in the sinlessness of our God¦151469 and saviour¦151472 Yeshua Christ that's just as precious as our faith.
\p
\v 2 May you¦151477 experience much grace¦151476 and peace¦151479 through your knowledge¦151482 of God¦151484 and Yeshua¦151486 our¦151490 Lord.
\s1 The calling and peg-alam of God our
\rem /s1 Growing in the Knowledge of God; The Christian's Call and Election; Making One's Calling and Election Sure; God's Call and Choice; Living in the last days
\p
\p
\v 3 He has given us everything necessary for life¦151505 and godliness through¦151509 his divine¦151497 power¦151498 as we know¦151511 the one who called¦151513 us to his own glory¦151517 and moral excellence.
\v 4 Through these¦151538 things¦151538, he has given us precious¦151525 and very great¦151529 promises¦151533 that you will become¦151539 participants of the divine¦151540 nature¦151542 after escaping¦151544 the corruption¦151555 in the world¦151549 of lust.
\v 5 For this same¦151558 reason, work hard to apply your¦151571 faith¦151570 adding moral excellence, and to that excellence add knowledge¦151579;
\v 6 to that knowledge¦151583 add self-control; to that self-control add endurance; to that endurance add godliness;
\v 7 to that godliness add brotherly concern; and to the brotherly concern add selfless love.
\v 8 Because¦151612 if these¦151611 things¦151611 are part of you¦151613 and¦151616 continually increasing, your knowledge¦151631 of our¦151628 Lord Yeshua¦151629 Christ won't become useless or unproductive.
\v 9 But if these¦151636 things¦151636 aren't part of someone, that person is shortsighted as if they've forgotten that prior cleansing of their sins¦151648.
\p
\v 10 So then fellow Christians, work hard to make your¦151660 calling¦151663 and election certain—that way you will never fall away—
\v 11 and so you¦151679 will be richly¦151677 provided entry into the eternal¦151685 kingdom¦151687 of our¦151692 Lord and saviour¦151692 Yeshua¦151694 Christ.
\rem /s1 Paying Attention to Scripture; Prophecy of Scripture
\p
\p
\v 12 Therefore¦151696 I intend to always¦151702 remind¦151704 you about these¦151706 things¦151706, even though you know them and are already established in the truth¦151717 that you know.
\v 13 But I consider¦151720 it¦151720 right¦151718, as long as I live in this tent, to get you¦151729 stirred up with a reminder,
\v 14 since I know that this tent of mine will soon be left behind as our¦151747 Lord Yeshua¦151748 Christ himself told me.
\v 15 And I will also make every effort to make sure that you¦151757 will always remember¦151764 these¦151763 things¦151763 after¦151758 my departure¦151761.
\rem /s1 Eyewitnesses of Christ's Glory
\p
\p
\v 16 We didn't follow¦151770 cleverly¦151768 crafted fables, but¦151782 rather having been eyewitnesses¦151783 of the majesty of our¦151776 Lord Yeshua¦151777 Christ, we¦151771 made his power¦151779 and¦151780 forthcoming return known¦151771 to you¦151772.
\v 17 \x + \xo 1:17-18: \xt Mat 17:1-5; Mrk 9:2-7; Luk 9:28-35.\x*Because¦151790 he received¦151789 the honour¦151795 and glory from {God the Father}=G when a voice¦151798 spoke to him with magnificent glory saying, “This is my¦151811 son that I dearly love and who has pleased¦151820 me greatly.”
\v 18 Indeed we heard¦151827 this voice¦151825 from heaven¦151830 ourselves as we had been taken with him¦151834 to the holy mountain¦151841.
\p
\v 19 In addition there are the words of the prophets¦151846 that were fulfilled which you would do well to pay attention to—like a light that shines in the dark places¦151857—until¦151858 the day¦151861 dawns and the one who is the morning¦151864 star¦151864 rises in your¦151869 hearts¦151868.
\v 20 And know this foundational truth: all of the prophecy¦151875 in Scripture doesn't just come from our own interpretations¦151880
\v 21 or from the ideas of man¦151886, but¦151892 from God¦151902 speaking via men being¦151896 guided by the Holy Spirit.

\p
\p
\v 1 But just like there were also false prophets¦151908 among the people¦151911, so also there will be false teachers¦151917 among you¦151915 who will sneakily¦151919 bring in destructive heresies—even denying the Master¦151926 and thus bringing¦151928 swift destruction upon themselves¦151930.
\v 2 Many people will follow¦151935 their¦151936 gross immorality causing evil to be spoken of about the true way¦151944.
\v 3 They will exploit you¦151953 with greed¦151950 and made-up words but the judgment¦151960 of old won't be idle and their¦151968 destroyer¦151967 won't be sleeping.
\p
\p
\v 4 Because¦151973 if God=G didn't spare¦151979 the messengers¦151976 when they sinned¦151977, but¦151980 chained them in darkness¦151983 and kept¦151989 them to be delivered to judgement in due course,
\v 5 \x + \xo 2:5: \xt Gen 6:1–7:24.\x*and¦151993 if he=G didn't spare¦151997 the ancient¦151994 world but¦151998 only preserved¦152003 the eight¦151999 including Noah¦152000 the proclaimer¦152002 of righteousness¦152001 when the flood¦152004 came upon the ungodly¦152007 world,
\v 6 \x + \xo 2:6: \xt Gen 19:24.\x*and if he¦152010 reduced¦152015 the cities¦152010 of Sodom¦152011 and Gomorrah¦152013 to ashes¦152015 by a catastrophe which condemned¦152017 them to being an example¦152018 of what the ungodly¦152023 will become,
\v 7 \x + \xo 2:7: \xt Gen 19:1-16.\x*and if he saved the righteous¦152027 man Lot¦152028 who was distressed¦152029 by the gross immorality of the lawless¦152034 people
\v 8 and whose righteous soul was tormented¦152056 by seeing¦152040 and hearing¦152043 their lawlessness¦152054 day after day,
\v 9 then the Lord knows how to rescue¦152063 godly¦152059 people from their trials, and knows how to keep the unrighteous¦152065 people to be punished¦152072 at the day¦152070 of judgement,
\v 10 especially those who follow their fleshly¦152078 lusts¦152080 that defile¦152083 themselves and despise¦152087 his Lordship.
\p Those bold, self-willed¦152090 people don't¦152093 worry about insulting¦152095 the glorious¦152091 ones,
\v 11 whereas¦152096 even messengers¦152097 who are greater¦152102 in both strength¦152098 and¦152099 power¦152100 don't¦152104 slander¦152111 or pass the Lord's judgement on those glorious ones.
\v 12 But these¦152113 men act like unthinking animals¦152118 that are born to be captured¦152124 and destroyed when they slander¦152131 concerning things¦152128 they know nothing about, and they will bring about their¦152136 own destruction.
\v 13 The harm they did will lead to their own harm as payment as their indulgence in broad daylight. They've become spots and¦152155 blemishes¦152156 as they feast¦152164 together with you¦152165 yet take joy in their deception.
\v 14 Their eyes¦152166 are full of lust for adultery¦152169 and never cease to sin¦152173, and having trained¦152179 their hearts¦152178 in greed¦152180 they entice¦152175 unstable¦152177 people to become their cursed¦152183 offspring.
\v 15 \x + \xo 2:15-16: \xt Num 22:4-35.\x*They have left the right path and gone astray, following¦152190 the path of Balaam the son of Bosor¦152196 who loved¦152201 the wages of unrighteousness¦152200,
\v 16 but he was scolded for his sin when a normally dumb donkey¦152208 spoke¦152214 to him with a man's voice¦152213 to stop his madness.
\p
\p
\v 17 These¦152220 men are like waterless¦152223 fountains and like mists¦152225 driven¦152229 by storms¦152228, and the gloomy darkness is reserved for them
\v 18 because they¦152243 speak¦152242 vane and inflated words to entice¦152243 people to fleshly¦152246 lusts¦152245. Those who have just escaped¦152252 from the errors of their living
\v 19 are promised¦152262 freedom¦152260, but they themselves have become slaves¦152264 to corruption¦152268, because¦152270 whatever a person has been defeated by is what they become a slave to.
\v 20 Because¦152277 if they have escaped¦152278 the defilements¦152280 of the world¦152282 by their knowledge¦152284 of our Lord and saviour¦152289 Yeshua¦152290 Christ and yet get entangled¦152295 again¦152294, they are defeated and have ended up worse¦152302 off than at the beginning.
\v 21 It would have been better¦152305 not to have known the way of righteousness¦152317, than having known it and to turn back from the holy instruction that was passed on to them.
\v 22 \x + \xo 2:22: \xt Prv 26:11.\x*The proverb¦152340 is correct in what it¦152346 says and has happened¦152333 to them: “A dog returns¦152342 to its¦152344 own vomit¦152346,” and “A sow that's been washed¦152349 wallows¦152351 in the mud again.”

\v 1 This is now my second¦152357 letter¦152360 to you my friends—both of which¦152362 were sent as reminders to stir up your¦152364 minds to sincerely¦152369
\v 2 remember the words spoken¦152373 in the past by the holy prophets¦152378 as well as the instruction of the Lord and saviour¦152389 that came via your¦152383 apostles.
\v 3 \x + \xo 3:3: \xt Hud 18.\x*Firstly you should know that mockers¦152405 will come during the last days¦152402, scoffing, following their¦152407 own lusts¦152410
\v 4 and¦152413 saying¦152414, “What about his¦152421 promised¦152418 return? Everything has just continued¦152430 as usual from the beginning¦152432 of creation¦152433 right past the time¦152423 when the ancestors¦152426 died.
\v 5 \x + \xo 3:5: \xt Gen 1:6-9.\x*But because of their desires, the truth is hidden from them that the universe came into being long ago by God's word and the earth¦152445 was formed out of water and through¦152449 water
\v 6 \x + \xo 3:6: \xt Gen 7:11.\x*and these same waters¦152464 deluged the ancient world¦152463 which¦152459 then perished¦152466.
\v 7 But the present universe and the earth¦152473 have been preserved by that same¦152476 word to be kept¦152482 for fire¦152481 in the day¦152484 of judgement and destruction¦152488 of those who are ungodly¦152490.
\p
\p
\v 8 \x + \xo 3:8: \xt Psa 90:4.\x*But don't¦152495 let this one thing escape¦152496 your attention my dear friends, that one day for us is like a thousand years with the Lord, and a thousand years is like one day.
\v 9 The Lord isn't slow in fulfilling his promise¦152520 as some consider¦152524 slowness¦152523, but is patient¦152526 toward¦152528 you¦152529—not wanting anyone to perish¦152535 but rather wanting everyone to come to repentance¦152540.
\p
\v 10 \x + \xo 3:10: \xt Mat 24:43; Luk 12:39; 1Tis 5:2; Rev 16:15.\x*But the day¦152545 of the Lord will come like a thief¦152548, when the universe will suddenly pass away, its components will burn up and be destroyed¦152561, and the earth¦152565 and what happened on it¦152569 will be examined.
\v 11 Since all these¦152576 things¦152576 will be destroyed¦152582, what kind of people¦152583 should you¦152586 be? Holy and¦152592 godly in conduct¦152591,
\v 12 waiting for and hastening the coming¦152598 of the day¦152603 of God¦152601 when the universe will be set alight and destroyed¦152608 and its components will melt as they burn up.
\v 13 \x + \xo 3:13: \xt Isa 65:17; 66:22; Rev 21:1.\x*But we¦152630 await a new universe and¦152618 a new earth¦152620 filled with righteousness¦152633 according¦152624 to his¦152629 promise¦152627.

\v 15 And consider¦152657 the patience¦152655 of our Lord as leading to salvation¦152656 as our dear brother¦152664 Paul¦152665 wrote¦152672 to you¦152673 using the wisdom¦152671 that has been given¦152669 to him¦152670.
\v 16 He speaks¦152680 in all his letters¦152679 concerning¦152684 these¦152685 things, some of which are hard to understand¦152691 and which ignorant¦152695 and unstable¦152697 people twist just like they twist the other¦152703 scriptures¦152704 to their¦152706 own destruction¦152710.

\v 17 So knowing¦152714 this in advance dear friends, guard¦152717 yourselves in case you fall from your own stable position with the same errors as the lawless¦152722 ones.
\v 18 Rather grow in the grace¦152734 and knowledge¦152736 of our¦152741 Lord and saviour¦152741 Kesus Christ. May the glory¦152746 be his, both now and through the days of eternity¦152752. Amen.
