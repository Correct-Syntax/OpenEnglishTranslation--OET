\is1 Introduction
\ip \bk Second Shemuel\bk* (commonly, but wrongly known as ‘Samuel’) is the continuation of \bk First Shemuel\bk*—the two parts together are considered a single ‘book’ in the Jewish Bible—it's only split into two because it was too long to fit on a single scroll.
\ip This the story of David's reign: firstly he ruled of Yehudah there to south of east, (Chapter 1–4) and finally diyad e of entire nation, including Israel there to north of east (Chapter 5–24). Naay-ayaran of egguhud this story concerning if immenu of David of pegpakig-ehet of his enemies there to seled of nation and there to other nations so that egmaluag the kingdom din and so that egmaresen the kingdom din.

\v 2 Then¦141777 on the third¦141780 day¦141779, wow, a man¦141782 came¦141796 from Sha'ul's camp. He had torn clothes¦141789 and dirt on his head, and when he got to David¦141799 he \add ≈fell onto his knees and bowed low\add*.
\v 3 “Where \add ≈have you¦141809 come from\add*?” David¦141806 \add ≈asked\add* him.

\v 1 After \add ≈that was over\add*, David inquired from Yahweh, “Should I go into one of Yehudah's cities?”
\p “\add Yes,\add*, go,” Yahweh \add ≈answered\add*.
\p “Where should I go?” David \add ≈asked\add* \add again\add*.
\p “To Hebron,” he said.

\v 2 \add ≈So\add* David took his two wives (Ahinoam the Yezreelite and Abigail the \add ≈widow\add* of Nabal the Carmelite) and went there.\x + \xo 2:2: \xt 1Sam 25:42-43.\x*
\v 3 He took his men who were with him, along with their \add ≈families\add*, and went to live in Hebron and the \add surrounding\add* towns.
\v 4 Then the Yehudah \add ≈leaders\add* came and anointed David as king over Yehudah.

\v 5 \add ≈So\add* David sent messengers to Yabesh-Gilead to tell them, “May Yahweh bless you all because you \add ≈showed\add* that kindness to your master Sha'ul to bury him \add respectfully\add*.
\v 6 Now may Yahweh \add ≈treat\add* you all with kindness and faithfulness, and I myself will also be good to you because you did that.
\v 7 \add ≈Meanwhile\add* now that Sha'ul your master is dead, \add continue\add* to be courageous and become \add ≈brave warriors\add* as Yehudah has anointed me as king over \add ≈their tribe\add*.

\p
\v 8 \add However,\add* Abner (Ner's son) who'd been Sha'ul's army commander had taken Sha'ul's son Iysh-Boshet\f + \fr 2:8 \ft Also known as Esh-Baal. (See 1 Chronicles 8:33.)\f* across to Mahanaim
\v 9 and \add ≈declared\add* him to be king over Gilead, and over the Asherites and Yezreel, and over Efraim and Benyamin, and over all of Israel.
\v 10 Iysh-Boshet \add ≈was forty years old\add* when he \add ≈started to rule\add* over the \add ≈Israelis\add*, and he \add ≈ruled them\add* for two years.
\p But the tribe of Yehudah was loyal to David
\v 11 and \add *he\add* \add ≈ruled them\add* for seven and a half years.
\rem /s1 The Battle of Gibeon; War between Israel and Judah
\p
\v 12 \add One day\add* Abner left Mahanaim with \add some of\add* Iysh-Boshet's servants and went to Gibeon,
\v 13 \add ≈but\add* Yoav (Tseruyah's son, \add traditionally called ‘Joab’ in English\add*) \add took some of\add* David's servants and went and \add ≈confronted\add* them at the Gibeon pool—one group on each side of the pool.
\v 14 Then Abner said to Yoav, “\add ≈Let's get some of these young warriors to fight it out in front of us\add*.”
\p “\add ≈Sounds good to me\add*,” said Yoav.
\p
\v 15 \add ≈So they stood up and counted off\add* twelve \add ≈representing\add* Benyamin and Sha'ul's son Iysh-Boshet and twelve from David's servants.
\v 16 Each of them grabbed his opponent's head and then thrust his sword into his side, so they both fell \add down\add* dead together. \add ≈So\add* that place in Gibeon was \add ≈named\add* ‘Helkat-Hatsurim’ \add (meaning ‘Field of Daggers’)\add*.
\p
\v 17 \add That led on to\add* a very intense battle that day, \add ≈but\add* Abner and the Israeli men were \add ≈defeated\add* by David's servants.
\rem /s1 The Death of Asahel
\v 18 Tseruyah's three sons were there: Yoav, Avishay, and Asahel, (Asahel was a \add ≈fast runner\add*—like a wild antelope.)
\v 19 and Asahel chased after Abner and \add ≈wouldn't give up\add*.
\v 20 Abner turned and said, “Is that you, Asahel?”
\p “\add Yes,\add* it's me,” he \add ≈answered\add*.
\p
\v 21 “\add I'm warning you:\add* \add ≈Stop chasing me and go after someone else instead\add*,” Abner \add ≈called back\add*. But Asahel \add ≈wouldn't give up\add*
\v 22 \add ≈so\add* Abner \add ≈tried again\add*, “\add ≈Stop chasing me! You'll force me to kill you\add*, then how could I face your brother Yoav?”
\v 23 \add ≈But\add* \add @Asahel\add* \add ≈wouldn't give up so\add* Abner thrust the butt end of his spear into his stomach and it went right through and came out his back. He fell to the ground and died there, and \add ≈when the others caught up, they stopped\add* there.
\p
\v 24 \add ≈But\add* Yoav and Abishai \add ≈kept going\add* after Abner. As the sun was setting, they came to the Ammah hill (east of Giah, along the road to the wilderness near Gibeon)
\v 25 and the \add ≈Benyamites lined up\add* behind Abner as an \add ≈coordinated unit\add* there on top of \add ≈the\add* hill.
\v 26 Abner called out to Yoav, “\add ≈Are we just going to keep killing each other\add*? Don't you know that \add ≈the only result can be more\add* bitterness? How long will you \add ≈go on before you command your people to stop killing\add* their \add ≈cousins\add*?”
\p
\v 27 “\add ≈As God lives\add*,” Yoav \add ≈replied\add*, “if you hadn't \add ≈said that\add*, then surely \add ≈it would have been morning before they would have pulled back from the chase\add*.”
\v 28 \add ≈So\add* Yoav had a trumpet blown and \add &his\add* men \add ≈stopped fighting and pursing the Israelis\add*.
\p
\v 29 Then Abner and his men walked all that night through the \add ≈Jordan river plain\add*, then crossed the \add *river\add* and walked all morning until they got \add back\add* to Mahanaim.
\p
\v 30 \add ≈When\add* Yoav had assembled them all \add and counted them, only\add* Asahel and nineteen others had been killed in the battle,
\v 31 \add ≈although\add* \add *they\add* had killed 360 of Abner's Benyamite \add ≈warriors\add*.
\v 32 They \add ≈retrieved Asahel's body\add* and buried it in his father's tomb in Bethlehem. Then \add *they\add* walked all night and got \add back\add* to Hebron \add ≈at first\add* light.

\p
\v 6 \add ≈While the war between Sha'ul's son Iysh-Boshet and David's supporters continued\add*, Abner was strengthening himself with Sha'ul's \add ≈supporters\add*.
\v 7 \add ≈Now\add* Sha'ul had had a slave-wife named Ritspah (duaghter of Ayyah) and Abner slept with her. \add ≈So\add* \add Iysh-Boshet\add* \add ≈demanded\add*, “Why have you slept with my father's slave-wife?”
\v 8 Abner \add ≈became very angry at this challenge from Iysh-Boshet and snapped back\add*, “\add ≈Do you think I'm Yehudah's dog\add* \add hiding out over here\add*? Today I've been \add ≈helping\add* Sha'ul's \add ≈family\add*: your father, his brothers, and his friends, and I won't let you fall into David's \add #hands\add*. \add ≈Yet\add* today you \add ≈bring some charge against me to do with a\add* woman?
\v 9 May God punish \add *me\add* if I don't do for David exactly what Yahweh promised him

\v 11 Iysh-Boshet didn't say a word back to Abner because he was very scared of him.
\p
\v 12 Then Abner sent messengers to David to tell \add <him\add*, “Who should be king of this \add ≈country\add*? \add ≈Let's come to an agreement and then I could join you\add* \add and help\add* make all of Israel turn to you.”
\p
\v 13 “\add Yes,\add* good,” \add @David\add* \add ≈replied\add*. “\add ≈I'm happy to come to an agreement with you on one condition: you must bring my wife—Sha'ul's daughter, Mikal—if you want to be accepted here\add*.”
\v 14 Then David sent messengers to Sha'ul's son Iysh-Boshet saying, “Give \add ≈Mikal back to\add* me. \add ≈I earnt her as my wife with\add* the foreskins of one-hundred Philistines.”\x + \xo 3:14: \xt 1Sam 18:27.\x*
\v 15 \add ≈So\add* Iysh-Boshet \add ≈had her taken\add* from \add &her\add* husband (Laish's son Paltiel),
\v 16 \add ≈but\add* he walked along behind her, weeping, as far as Bahurim \add where finally\add* Abner told him to go \add ≈back home\add* and \add ≈so he did\add*.
\p
\v 17 Then Abner conferred with the Israeli elders saying, “\add ≈Previously\add* you were wanting David to be king over you,
\v 18 \add ≈but now it's time for action\add*. Yahweh has \add already\add* said, ‘\add ≈I'm going to use\add* my servant David to rescue my people Israel from the Philistines and all their \add other\add* enemies.’ ”
\v 19 Abner also spoke \add ≈privately with the Benyamites\add*, then he went to Hebron to tell David \add ≈privately what the Israelis and the Benyamites had agreed to\add*.
\p
\v 20 Then Abner took twenty men and went to David at Hebron, and David put on a feast for \add ≈all of them\add*.
\v 21 Abner \add ≈asked\add* David, “My master, the king.

\p
\v 22 \add Soon afterwards,\add* Yoav and some of David's \add ≈men\add* arrived after a raid and \add ≈carried in\add* a lot of plunder. (Abner had already left Hebron because \add David\add* had sent him off and he'd left in peace.)
\v 23 \add ≈When\add* Yoav and all the fighters with him arrived, \add *he\add* was told that Abner had been there and spoken with the king, then sent away in peace.
\v 24 \add ≈So Yoav\add* went to the king and \add ≈demanded\add*, “What have you done? Abner came to you \add ≈and I can't believe that you'd let him go, but he's definitely not here now\add*.
\v 25 \add ≈Surely you realise that\add* \add *he\add* \add only\add* came \add ≈here to influence you and to find out where you're coming from and going to, and to learn everything\add* that you're doing?”
\p
\v 26 \add ≈Once Yoav had finished talking to\add* David, he sent messengers \add ≈to catch up to\add* Abner. They \add found him\add* at the Sirah cistern and brought him back \add ≈without David's knowledge\add*.
\v 27 \add ≈When\add* Abner got back to Hebron, Yoav took him aside at the \add city\add* gate as if to speak to him privately, then \add ≈stabbed\add* him in the stomach and he died \add ≈as vengeance for killing\add* \add @Yoav's\add* brother Asahel.
\v 28 \add Later\add* \add ≈when\add* David heard about it, he \add ≈declared\add*, “I and my kingdom are innocent \add ≈of Abner's death in Yahweh's eyes\add*.
\v 29 \add ≈May Yoav's extended family continually suffer from sores or leprousy, and be forced into manual labour or be killed in battle, or run out of food to eat\add*.”
\v 30 (\add That's how\add* Yoav and his brother Abishai murdered Abner because he'd killed their brother Asahel in Gibeon during the war.)
