\is1 Introduction
\ip This account tells about the life of a young Jewish woman named Esther. These events happened back when King Ahasuerus (more widely known as King Xerxes) ruled over the kingdom of Persia. After Queen Vashti was banished for refusing to dance in front the king's guests at a drinking party, Esther was chosen as the new queen without revealing her Jewish background. But there was a high official called Haman who was offended by Esther's Jewish guardian and in his anger, determined to annihilate all of the Jews from the kingdom. This account reveals how Ether's courage and her love for her Jewish people leads her to help them and eventually helps to save their lives.
\ip The account also reveals the source of a Jewish feast named ‘Purim’, which to this day is a time when Jewish people celebrate how God saved them from their enemy, Haman.

\s1 Queen Vashti refuses King Ahasuerus
\p
\v 1 The following events happened during the reign of \add King\add* Ahasuerus.\x + \xo 1:1: \xt Ezr 4:6.\x* (\add Also known as King Xerxes,\add* he ruled \add the empire of Persia\add* with 127 provinces from India all the way across to Ethiopia.)
\v 2 In those days, he ruled his empire from \add a city called\add* Susa, \add Persia's\add* capital.
\p
\v 3 In the third year of his reign, he hosted a celebration for all of his officials and for every important person who worked for him, as well as the officers who served in the army of the \add combined empire\add* of Persia and Media, the wealthy landowners, and the officials of the provinces. The king was present in person \add to host the celebration\add*
\v 4 which, over a period of six months, would display the incredible wealth and prestige of his empire and his personal wealth and power.
\p
\v 5 Then at the end of that time, the king hosted \add another\add* celebration, but this time for all the people in the royal fort in Susa, from the nobles to the least prestigious. He held this celebration over an entire week in the enclosed garden of the royal palace.
\v 6 There were white and blue curtains hanging from white and purple cords attached to silver rings on marble pillars. The guests reclined on gold and silver couches set on a mosaic floor that was made of red and white marble, and mother-of-pearl and other expensive stones.
\v 7 Drinks were served in golden goblets, and each one was a unique design. The king's wine seemed limitless as he displayed his generosity,
\v 8 and it was served according to his rule: There is no compulsion to drink, but all of his servants were to give each guest however much they wanted.
\p
\v 9 Meanwhile, Queen Vashti was hosting a celebration for the women \add in a different part\add* of the king's royal palace.
\p
\v 10 On the seventh day of the celebrations, when the king was feeling cheery from his wine-drinking, he ordered seven of his chief servants (Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, Abagtha, Zethar, and Karkas)
\v 11 to bring Queen Vashti, wearing her royal crown, to him in order to show her beauty to the people and the officials, because she was very attractive.
\v 12 But when the servants came and told her the king's comand, Queen Vashti refused to come. When the king found this out, he got very angry and \add sat there\add* raging.
\v 13 So he \add called over\add* his advisors who knew the law and could make good decisions, and discussed with them what he should do.
\v 14 (His closest advisors were Karshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memukan. These seven officials were from \add various places in the empire\add* of Persia and Media and they advised the king personally, \add thus making them\add* the most powerful officials in the empire.)
\v 15 “According to \add our\add* law,” \add the king asked,\add* “what should be done with Queen Vashti, since she refused to obey my command when the servants passed it on to her?”
\p
\v 16 Then Memukan answered the king, \add speaking loudly enough that\add* both the king and his officials could hear. “Queen Vashti has done wrong,” he said, “and not only against the king. She has also done wrong against all the officials and people groups in all the provinces that King Ahasuerus \add rules\add*!
\v 17 \add Soon\add* women all over the empire will hear about what the queen did and they'll say, ‘King Ahasuerus commanded his servants to bring Queen Vashti to him, but she didn't go! Then women will stop respecting their husbands.
\v 18 Even today, the leading women of Persia and Media will hear what the queen did and start doing the same to \add their husbands who are\add* officials, and this will cause \add a wave of\add* contempt and anger.
\v 19 If it pleases you \add to do so\add*, \add your majesty\add*, you should personally issue a royal decree and have it added to the laws of Persia and Media which cannot be repealed. This decree should say that Vashti can never again come into your presence, and then you should choose a different woman for the royal position—someone who's better than her.
\v 20 Your decree will be proclaimed right through your empire, even though it's so huge, and then all women, irrespective of their status or position, will honour their husbands.
\p
\v 21 This seemed like a good idea to the king and his officials, so King Ahasuerus followed the advice of Memukan
\v 22 and sent letters to every province in his empire. He wrote to every province using its own alphabet and to each people group in its own language. The letters said that men should be the masters over their wives and children, and that a husband should be able to give orders to his wife in his own native language \add that she should understand and obey\add*.

\s1 Esther becomes queen
\p
\v 1 Some time later when King Ahasuerus no longer felt so angry, he \add started to miss\add* Vashti. But when she'd disobeyed his command, he had made a decree \add that she could never come into his presence again\add*.
\v 2 So some of the young men who served the king suggested to him, “\add Your majesty, you should get a new wife for yourself.\add* You could tell your servants to look for young virgins who are very beautiful.
\v 3 You could assign officers in each province of your empire to bring every virgin who is very beautiful here to your capital city of Susa. They could stay in the harem for virgins under the custody of Hegai, the castrated royal guardian who takes care of the young women who live there and he could arrange for them to receive beauty treatments.
\v 4 Then you could decide which young woman you like best and then make her queen instead of Vashti.”
\p The king liked what they suggested, so he did it.
\p
\v 5 At that time, there was a Jewish man named Mordecai living in the capital city of Susa. (He was from the tribe of Benjamin: his father was Jair, his grandfather was Shimei, and his great-grandfather was Kish
\v 6 who'd been taken away from Jerusalem and led to Babylon when King Nebuchadnezzer of Babylon had exiled Jeconiah, the king of Judah, along with many of his people.\x + \xo 2:6: \xt 2Ki 24:10-16; 2Ch 36:10.\x*)
\v 7 Now Mordecai was taking care of his cousin, who was an orphan. When her father and mother had died, Mordecai had adopted her as his own daughter. Her \add Hebrew\add* name was Hadassah, and her \add Persian\add* name was Esther. Esther was now a young woman and she was exceptionally attractive.
\p
\v 8 So when the king's command and decree became known, many young women were being brought into the capital city of Susa and placed under Hegai's charge, and this is what happened to Esther. (Hegai was the overseer of the women.)
\v 9 Hegai was very impressed with Esther, and he treated her favorably. He quickly arranged for Esther to receive her beauty treatments and her allotment of food, as well as choosing seven female servants from the king’s palace and assigning them to be her personal attendants. He also moved Esther and her attendants to the best rooms in the harem for virgins.
\v 10 (Esther hadn't revealed her family ties or her Jewishness to anyone, because Mordecai had instructed her not to.)
\p
\v 11 Every day Mordecai would walk around in front of the courtyard of the women's harem to find out \add from others\add* how Esther was doing and how she was being treated.
\p
\v 12 Each young woman would get twelve months of beauty treatment according to the \add Persian\add* law for women—there would be six months of applying oil of myrrh, then six months of perfumes and other lotions \add designed for\add* women. Then their turn would come, one at a time, to be taken to King Ahasuerus.
\v 13 The young woman was allowed to take whatever she wanted from the harem when she went to the king's house.
\v 14 She'd be taken across in the evening, and in the morning she'd be led out to the other harem which was for the concubines. (That harem was overseen by Shaashgaz, another castrated royal guardian.) The women taken there wouldn't go again to the king's house unless he had especially liked them and summoned her back by name.
