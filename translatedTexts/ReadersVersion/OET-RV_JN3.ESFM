\v 1 \x + \xo 1: \xt Acts 19:29; Rom 16:23; 1Cor 1:14.\x*This letter is from John the elder to my dear friend Gaius who I love \add because we both\add* follow the truth¦155507.
\p
\v 2 My dear friend, I trust that you are healthy and doing well in everything just as you are also doing well spiritually.
\v 3 I was very happy when some of our \add spiritual\add* brothers¦155525 came and told us about your faithfulness to the truth and how you are living it out.
\v 4 Nothing makes me more happy than hearing that other believers that I've helped are living out the truth¦155552.
\s1 Praising Gaius
\p
\v 5 My dear friend, you are fatihful in what you do for other believers. Even strangers
\v 6 have told the assembly about your caring for them before sending them on. Your actions will be praised by God
\v 7 because they¦155591 went out to serve God, not getting any help from the unbelievers.
\v 8 We should be supporting¦155601 believers like them so that we may also become their workmates in sharing the truth¦155611.
\s1 Diotrephes and Demetrius
\p
\v 9 I wrote¦155612 something to the assembly, but Diotrephes¦155621 won't listen to us—he always wants the limelight for himself.
\v 10 Because of that, if I do end up coming, I will be reminding¦155630 him about what he's been doing—rambling on against us with evil¦155637 talks, and then, not being happy with that, he doesn't accept other believers and expels them from the assembly then forbids others from accepting¦155648 them either.
\p
\v 11 My dear friend, don't copy the evil things \add that others do\add*, just the good things. Anyone who does what is good belongs to God—whoever does evil things has not seen¦155679 God.
\p
\v 12 Demetrius has been talked about by everyone and even the truth¦155693 itself¦155688 speaks. We¦155682 have also spoken about him, and you¦155700 know that what we¦155695 say is true.
\s1 The pegpanaha-taha
\p
\v 13 I had many things¦155710 I wanted to write¦155713 about, but¦155715 won't do it by means of ink¦155720 and¦155721 pen,
\v 14 but instead I hope to see¦155732 you¦155731 soon and¦155733 then we¦155738 can speak face to face.
\p
\v 15 Wishing all peace and happiness for you. \add Your\add* friends here also greet you. Please greet \add our\add* friends there by name.
