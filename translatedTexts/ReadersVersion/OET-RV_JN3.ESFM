\rem /s1 Gaius Commended for His Hospitality
\p
\v 2 My dear friend, I trust that you are healthy¦155489 and doing well in everything just as you are also doing well spiritually.
\v 3 I was very happy when some of our \add spiritual\add* brothers¦155499 came and told us about your¦155503 faithfulness to the truth and how you are living it out.
\v 4 Nothing makes me more happy than hearing¦155520 that other believers that I've helped are living out the truth¦155526.

\p
\v 5 My dear friend, you are faithful¦155529 in what you do for other believers¦155536. Even strangers¦155541
\v 6 have told the assembly¦155548 about your¦155544 caring for them before¦155547 sending them on. Your¦155544 actions will be praised by \nd God¦155558\nd*
\v 7 because¦155559 they¦155565 went¦155565 out to serve God, not getting any help from the unbelievers.
\v 8 We should be supporting¦155575 believers like them so that we may also become¦155581 their workmates in sharing the truth¦155585.
\s1 Diotrephes and Demetrius
\p
\v 9 I wrote¦155586 something¦155588 to the assembly¦155590, but Diotrephes¦155595 won't listen to us—he always wants the limelight for himself.
\v 10 Because¦155599 of that, if I do end up coming, I will be reminding¦155604 him about what he's been doing¦155609—rambling¦155612 on against¦155612 us with evil¦155611 talks, and then, not being¦155617 happy with that, he doesn't accept other believers¦155624 and expels them from the assembly¦155633 then forbids¦155629 others from accepting¦155622 them either.
\p
\v 11 My dear friend, don't¦155636 copy the evil things \add that others do\add*, just the good things. Anyone who does what is good belongs to God—anyone who does evil things has not seen¦155653 God.
\p
\v 12 Demetrius¦155656 has been talked about by everyone and even the truth¦155667 itself¦155662 speaks. We have also spoken about him, and you¦155674 know that what we¦155669 say is true.

\p
\v 13 I had many things I wanted to write¦155687 about, but¦155689 won't do it by means of ink¦155694 and¦155695 pen¦155696,
\v 14 but¦155702 instead I hope to see¦155706 you¦155705 soon and¦155707 then we¦155712 can speak¦155712 face to face.
\p
\v 15 Wishing all peace and happiness for you. \add Your\add* friends here also greet you. Please greet \add our\add* friends there by name.
