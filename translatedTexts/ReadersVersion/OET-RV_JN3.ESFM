\v 1 \x + \xo 1: \xt Acts 19:29; Rom 16:23; 1Cor 1:14.\x*This letter is from Yohan the elder¦155472 to my dear friend Gaius¦155473 who I love \add because we both\add* follow the truth¦155480.
\rem /s1 Gaius Commended for His Hospitality
\p
\v 2 My dear friend, I trust that you are healthy¦155488 and doing well in everything just as you are also doing well spiritually.
\v 3 I was very happy when some of our \add spiritual\add* brothers¦155498 came and told us about your¦155502 faithfulness to the truth and how you are living it out.
\v 4 Nothing makes me more happy than hearing¦155519 that other believers that I've helped are living out the truth¦155525.

\v 5 My dear friend, you are faithful¦155528 in what you do for other believers¦155535. Even strangers¦155540
\v 6 have told the assembly¦155547 about your¦155543 caring for them before¦155546 sending them on. Your¦155543 actions will be praised by \nd God¦155557\nd*
\v 7 because¦155558 they¦155564 went out to serve God, not getting any help from the unbelievers.
\v 8 We should be supporting¦155574 believers like them so that we may also become¦155580 their workmates in sharing the truth¦155584.
\s1 Diotrephes and Demetrius
\p
\v 9 I wrote¦155585 something¦155587 to the assembly¦155589, but Diotrephes¦155594 won't listen to us—he always wants the limelight for himself.
\v 10 Because¦155598 of that, if I do end up coming, I will be reminding¦155603 him about what he's been doing¦155608—rambling¦155611 on against¦155611 us with evil¦155610 talks, and then, not being¦155616 happy with that, he doesn't accept other believers¦155623 and expels them from the assembly¦155632 then forbids¦155628 others from accepting¦155621 them either.
\p
\v 11 My dear friend, don't¦155635 copy the evil things \add that others do\add*, just the good things. Anyone who does what is good belongs to God—anyone who does evil things has not seen¦155652 God.
\p
\v 12 Demetrius¦155655 has been talked about by everyone and even the truth¦155666 itself¦155661 speaks. We have also spoken about him, and you¦155673 know that what we¦155668 say is true.

\p
\v 13 I had many things¦155683 I wanted to write¦155686 about, but¦155688 won't do it by means of ink¦155693 and¦155694 pen¦155695,
\v 14 but¦155701 instead I hope to see¦155705 you¦155704 soon and¦155706 then we¦155711 can speak¦155711 face to face.
\p
\v 15 Wishing all peace and happiness for you. \add Your\add* friends here also greet you. Please greet \add our\add* friends there by name.
