\mt2 Paul's letter to the 
\mt1 believers in Ephesus
\is1 Introduction
\is2 The author
\ip This \bk Letter to the believers in Ephesus\bk* was written by Paul from prison in Rome.
\is2 This letter
\ip This letter wasn't just written for the assembly of believers there in Ephesus, but also for other assemblies of believers.
\ip Paul's main theme is about God's plan that “at the right time he will gather everything, whether in heaven or here on earth, for the messiah” (1:10).
\ip In the first part of letter, he wrote about unity. Paul carefully explained about how God the father chooses his people, about forgiving and saving them from their sins through his son, Yeshua the messiah.
\ip In the second part of letter, Paul urges the reader that the believers need to be united in the messiah by means of their unity with each other.
\ip Paul uses many allegories about the unity of people with God via the messiah: the believers are the body of the messiah, he is the head; it's like a house, with the messiah as the foundation stone; the believers are also like a bride with the messiah as the groom.
\ip It's also explained here about the correct behaviour of couples, of parents and children, and of slaves and master. Then in concluding his letter, it's explained about the armour that's given to believers for them to use to stand against Satan's attacks.

\v 1 \add This letter is from\add* Paul¦128963, a missionary of Yeshua the messiah by the will of God¦128970.\x + \xo 1:1: \xt Acts 18:19-21; 19:1.\x*
\p To the godly people \add there in Ephesus¦128977\add* who are faithful¦128979 to Yeshua the messiah.
\p
\v 2 May our father¦128989 God¦128988 and our master¦128992 Yeshua¦128993 the messiah¦128994 give grace¦128983 and peace¦128986 to you¦128984 all.
\s1 Spiritual blessings
\p
\v 3 We praise God¦128997, the father¦128999 of our master¦129001 Yeshua¦129005 the messiah.\f + \fr 1:3 \ft Verses 3-14 seem to be just one long, rambling sentence in the Greek, and it's not totally clear what each part means, or how they all connect logically together in sequence. We have split it into smaller sentence chunks to try to help our readers extract some meaning out of it.\f* He is the one who's blessed us with every¦129011 spiritual¦129013 blessing in heavenly¦129016 places—blessings that come from the messiah.
\v 4 He chose¦129020 us to follow him even before¦129024 the creation of the world¦129026, so that we could become pure¦129029 and blameless¦129031 in front¦129032 of him. Because of his¦129032 love¦129035
\v 5 he decided in advance to adopt¦129039 us as his¦129051 children through¦129040 Yeshua¦129042 the messiah¦129043. His¦129051 decision gave him great pleasure¦129048
\v 6 and now he's praised¦129053 for the greatness of his¦129057 grace¦129056 which¦129060 favoured¦129061 us, as the one he loved¦129065
\v 7 \x + \xo 1:7: \xt Col 1:14.\x*redeemed us by means of his blood¦129074 and forgave our sins. It was from the riches¦129083 of his grace¦129087
\v 8 that was poured onto us that we gain wisdom¦129095 and¦129096 understanding¦129097
\v 9 as he revealed the mystery¦129101 of his will to us according¦129113 to his great pleasure¦129115 as he himself planned.
\v 10 He planned for the orchestration of the times¦129128, and at the right time he will gather everything, whether in heaven¦129140 or here on earth¦129145, for the messiah¦129134
\v 11 and we¦129151 also have been assigned an inheritance¦129151 in him¦129164. This was also predetermined¦129152 according to God's plan and the decisions of his¦129164 will
\v 12 so that we, the ones who first put our trust in the messiah¦129178, would praise¦129170 his¦129173 greatness.
\v 13 And you all also, after hearing the message of truth¦129188, the good message about being saved, were confirmed by receiving the spirit¦129201 of pure¦129205 promise¦129203 after you believed¦129197.
\v 14 This spirit is the deposit¦129209 on our¦129212 inheritance¦129211 until we procure¦129216 the freedom which has been bought for us, leading us to praise¦129218 God's greatness.
\s1 Paul's prayer for them
\p
\v 15 Because¦129222 of that, when I heard¦129225 about your faith¦129229 in the master¦129232 Yeshua¦129234 and¦129235 your \add acceptance\add* of all the pure¦129242 believers, 
\v 16 I don't¦129243 stop giving¦129245 thanks¦129245 for all of you, mentioning¦129248 you in my¦129254 prayers¦129253,
\v 17 asking the God¦129257 of our¦129260 master¦129259 Yeshua¦129262 the messiah¦129263 to give¦129268 you¦129270 spiritual¦129271 wisdom¦129272 and¦129273 to reveal the knowledge¦129276 about him¦129277.
\v 18 I ask that your¦129284 inner thoughts will be enlightened¦129278 so that you all will know the expectation of what he's calling¦129295 you too—the riches¦129300 of the greatness of his¦129296 inheritance¦129304 for the believers
\v 19 and the exceeding greatness¦129316 of his power to \add help\add* us who believe¦129323, according¦129324 to the working¦129326 of the power of his strength¦129330.
\v 20 \x + \xo 1:20: \xt Psa 110:1.\x*He worked¦129334 this power in the messiah¦129337 when he brought him back to life and seated him in the place of honour in heavenly¦129355 places—
\v 21 giving him authority¦129361 over every law and government and powerful¦129364 groups and organisations, and over every earthly title, not only in the present age but also in the age to come.
\v 22 \x + \xo 1:22: \xt Psa 8:6.\x*Everything in existence will be under¦129385 his¦129388 authority and God set him in charge of all matters concerning¦129393 the assembly¦129396,
\v 23 which¦129397 is his¦129401 body¦129400—the completeness of the messiah who completes everything.
\c 2
\s1 God's mercy, grace, and plans for us
\p
\v 1 \x + \xo 2:1-5: \xt Col 2:13.\x*You all were dead¦129413 due to your¦129423 disobedience and¦129417 the \add path of\add* sinning
\v 2 that you once walked¦129427 along when you followed the trends of this world¦129432 which¦129425 \add in turn\add* come from the ruler¦129436 of the invisible powers—he's the spirit¦129442 that works in the children of disobedience.
\v 3 In the past, we also lived like them inside our¦129466 fleshly lusts and then living out those desires and fantasies, and so we were children¦129478 \add deserving\add* strong anger¦129481 just like everyone else.
\p
\v 4 But God¦129488 was generous with his¦129497 mercy¦129492 because¦129493 of the great¦129495 love¦129496 that he loved¦129499 us with,
\v 5 so although we were dead¦129505 as a result of our disobedience, he make us alive¦129513 along with the messiah¦129516. Yes, we have been saved¦129519 by \add God's\add* grace¦129517.
\v 6 And God lifted us up and sat¦129523 us together¦129523 with Yeshua¦129530 the messiah¦129529 in the heavenly¦129526 \add domains\add*
\v 7 so that for the ages to come, he could display¦129532 the overflowing riches¦129542 of his grace¦129545 through his kindess to us via Yeshua¦129554 the messiah¦129553.
\v 8 It's \add God's\add* grace that allows you all to be saved¦129559 through¦129560 faith¦129562. This grace doesn't come from you, but rather it's a gift¦129570 from God—
\v 9 it doesn't originate from your actions so no one can brag about it.
\v 10 We are God's workmanship¦129582 and he's created¦129583 us to do good¦129589 things by following Yeshua¦129586 the messiah¦129585. God has already planned these things for us to do.
\s1 Jews and non-Jews can be united
\p
\v 11 Because of that, don't forget that you¦129604 all were once fleshly unbelievers (nicknamed ‘the uncircumcized¦129611 ones’ by circumsized¦129615 Jews who mark the bodies \add of their males\add* with human hands).
\v 12 At that time¦129623 you were separated from the citizens¦129629 of Israel and were strangers¦129633 to the agreements involving \add God's\add* promise¦129637. You didn't have any future hope as you lived in the world¦129645 without¦129625 \add knowing\add* God.
\p
\v 13 But now \add thanks to\add* Yeshua¦129650 the messiah, you¦129651 all who were once far \add from God\add* have become¦129657 close by means of the messiah's blood¦129661.
\v 14 He is \add the source\add* of peace¦129668 \add between Jews and non-Jews\add*, having broken¦129680 the dividing¦129677 wall that fenced¦129679 them apart and making the two into one. He took the hostility onto himself,
\v 15 \x + \xo 2:15: \xt Col 2:14.\x*having¦129693 declared the \add old \add* commandments¦129690 to be now void so that Jews and non-Jews can now be peaceably¦129707 united.
\v 16 \x + \xo 2:16: \xt Col 1:20.\x*By \add his death\add* on the pole, any hostility is destroyed and¦129709 both groups now become just one body¦129716 in God's sight.
\v 17 \x + \xo 2:17: \xt Isa 57:19.\x*When the messiah came, he announced the good message¦129729: peace to you all who were far \add from God\add*, and peace also to the ones who were near,
\v 18 so now both groups have access¦129748 to the father¦129756 by means of one spirit¦129753 through¦129739 \add the work of\add* the messiah.
\p
\v 19 As a result, you all are no longer¦129759 strangers¦129761 and foreigners, but fellow-citizens¦129766 of the believers and part of God's household¦129770
\v 20 which has been founded¦129776 on the teaching of the missionaries¦129778 and¦129779 prophets¦129780. The cornerstone¦129782 of this building is Yeshua¦129787 the messiah¦129786.
\v 21 He joins the entire building¦129792 together¦129793, growing¦129794 us all into a dedicated temple¦129796 for the master¦129799.
\v 22 You all are being¦129804 built¦129804 together¦129804 by following him, becoming a place¦129806 for God's spirit¦129811 to live in.
\c 3
\s1 Paul's assignment to non-Jews
\p
\v 1 That's the reason¦129814 that I, Paul¦129816, am a prisoner¦129818 \add due to my serving\add* Yeshua¦129821 the messiah¦129820 for you¦129823 non-Jews¦129825.
\v 2 Certainly you have heard¦129828 that God assigned me the task of passing on God's grace¦129832 to you.
\v 3 He revealed his incredible plan as I wrote¦129850 briefly previously¦129850
\v 4 \x + \xo 3:4-6: \xt Col 1:26-27.\x*and¦129858 which¦129855 you¦129856 are all able to read to understand¦129858 my¦129861 insight¦129860 into the incredible plan about the messiah¦129866.
\v 5 This plan wasn't explained to humans in in previous generations¦129870 but has now God's spirit¦129887 has revealed¦129879 it¦129887 to his¦129883 worthy missionaries¦129882 and¦129884 prophets¦129885.
\v 6 Now non-Jews¦129890 can have the same inheritance and become members¦129893 of the same body¦129893 and can share in the same promise¦129897 that was the positive message¦129905 of Yeshua¦129902 the messiah¦129901.
\p
\v 7 I have become¦129908 a servant¦129909 of that message as a result of the gift¦129912 of God's grace¦129914 that was given¦129919 to me by means of the working¦129924 of his¦129927 power¦129926.
\v 8 Although I was the least¦129932 of the ones dedicated to this message, I was given¦129936 the grace¦129938 to preach¦129943 this positive message to the non-Jews¦129942, to tell them about the endless riches¦129948 of the messiah¦129950
\v 9 and¦129951 to enlighten¦129952 everyone about the assignment of God's incredible plan. God, the one who created¦129971 everything, hid this plan away over the ages
\v 10 so that the wide-ranging wisdom¦129991 of God¦129993 could be revealed now through¦129986 the church to the rulers¦129979 and¦129980 authorities¦129982 in the heavenly¦129985 realms¦129985.
\v 11 God did this according¦129994 to his plan for the ages which¦129998 he established¦129999 in our¦130007 master¦130006, Yeshua¦130004 the messiah¦130003.
\v 12 It's through our faith¦130020 in Yeshua that we¦130010 can have boldness¦130012 and¦130013 confident¦130017 access¦130015 \add to God\add*.
\v 13 Because of that, I'm asking you not to become discouraged over my¦130030 current difficulties as I \add serve\add* you all, in fact you are honoured by them.
\s1 Paul prays for those in Ephesus
\p
\v 14 That's why I'm kneeling to \add ask\add* the father¦130047
\v 15 (the one that every¦130055 father in the heavens¦130058 and¦130059 on earth¦130061 is named¦130062 after)
\v 16 that he would cause you to be strengthened¦130076 inside¦130083 your minds by the power¦130075 of his spirit¦130079 and from the riches¦130070 of his greatness.
\v 17 Through \add your\add* faith¦130090, the messiah¦130087 can live in your hearts¦130093 so that love¦130096 will become your root and¦130098 foundation
\v 18 so that just like the dedicated ones, you¦130101 all will also be strong enough to understand the width and length¦130113 and height¦130115 and depth¦130118 of
\v 19 the messiah's¦130129 love, and to know¦130120 that having this love exceeds having knowledge¦130126 so that you all can be filled¦130131 with God's completeness.
\p
\v 20-21 Now we offer praise to \add God\add* in the church and for all the generations to come and to Yeshua the messiah—\add God\add* who, through the power¦130152 that works in us, is able to do far more than we can ask for or even understand¦130149. May it be so.
\c 4
\s1 Many parts and gifts but one body
\p
\v 1 Because of that, I, a prisoner¦130182 for the master¦130184, am urging you all to walk¦130187 worthily¦130186 of the calling¦130189 to which¦130190 you were called¦130191
\v 2 \x + \xo 4:2: \xt Col 3:12-13.\x*with all humility¦130194, gentleness¦130196, and¦130195 patience¦130199, putting up with one another¦130201 because of your love¦130203 \add for them\add*,
\v 3 being¦130204 serious about keeping¦130205 the unity of \add God's\add* spirit¦130209 in the bond of peace¦130214.
\v 4 There is one body¦130216 and one spirit¦130219, just as you all were called to one hope when you were called.
\v 5 There's one master¦130231, one \add system of\add* faith¦130233, one immersion¦130235,
\v 6 one God¦130237 and father¦130239 of all who is over all and through¦130245 all and in all.
\p
\v 7 Yet each one of us has been given¦130257 a measure¦130262 of grace¦130259 as a gift¦130264 from the messiah¦130266,
\v 8 just as it was written,
\q1 “When he ascended to heaven,
\q2 he eliminated captivity¦130274
\q2 and gave¦130276 gifts¦130277 to people¦130280.”\x + \xo 4:8: \xt Psa 68:18.\x*
\m
\v 9 Of course, he couldn't ascend if he hadn't first descended down to earth¦130298.
\v 10 So the one who descended is the very one who also ascended above¦130306 all the heavens¦130309 so that he could fill¦130311 all locations.
\v 11 Then he gave¦130316 some as missionaries¦130320, some as prophets¦130323, some as announcers of the good¦130326 message¦130326, some as pastors and teachers¦130331
\v 12 so as to complete¦130334 the dedicated ones for the work¦130339 of service¦130339—for building¦130341 the body¦130343 of the messiah¦130345
\v 13 until¦130346 we¦130347 can reach the unity of our faith¦130354 and¦130355 of our knowledge¦130357 about God's son—becoming mature¦130364 people measured¦130366 against the stature¦130367 of the fullness¦130369 of the messiah¦130371.
\v 14 Then we'll no longer¦130373 be \add like\add* children \add in our faith\add*, tossed¦130377 around by waves¦130377 and¦130378 being blown by every¦130380 wind¦130382 of teaching¦130384 used to trick¦130387 us or by crafty¦130391 people¦130389 who scheme¦130396 how to deceive us.
\v 15 Instead, by lovingly speaking the truth¦130402, we¦130406 will grow up into every aspect of him¦130408—the messiah¦130418 who is the head 
\v 16 \x + \xo 4:16: \xt Col 2:19.\x*that integrates the entire¦130422 body together and holds it together by every¦130429 one of its joints¦130430. When each component does its work, the body grows and builds¦130449 itself¦130451 up with love.
\s1 Proper behaviour for godly people
\p
\v 17 So I'll say this at the master's¦130460 direction: you¦130462 all are no longer¦130461 to walk¦130463 like \add unbelieving\add* pagans¦130468 who \add trust\add* in their¦130474 own futile thinking.
\v 18 Their¦130497 minds have been darkened¦130475 because their ignorance¦130487 has drawn them away from the life¦130482 of God¦130484 due to the hardening¦130494 of their hearts¦130496.
\v 19 They stopped caring \add about what's right and wrong\add*, and then greedily¦130510 indulged themselves¦130500 in their own impure¦130507 lusts.
\p
\v 20 But you¦130511 all didn't learn¦130515 that about the messiah¦130517.
\v 21 If you had heard him and listened to his teaching, you would have heard the truth¦130528 from Yeshua¦130531:
\v 22 \x + \xo 4:22: \xt Col 3:9.\x*that you reject the former conduct¦130539 of the old corrupted¦130544 you, those seductive¦130549 desires¦130547,
\v 23 and¦130552 allow the spirit¦130555 driving your¦130558 thoughts to be renewed¦130550
\v 24 \x + \xo 4:24: a \xt Col 3:10; \xo b \xt Gen 1:26.\x*and so to remodel yourself as a godly person¦130564 created¦130568 to obey God¦130567 and follow the pure truth¦130576.
\p
\v 25 \x + \xo 4:25: \xt Zech 8:16.\x*So steer clear of lies—always speak¦130581 the truth¦130582 to those around you because¦130591 we¦130593 are members¦130596 of each other.
\v 26 \x + \xo 4:26: \xt Psa 4:4 (LXX).\x*Even when you're angry, don't sin, and¦130598 don't carry your¦130608 anger¦130607 through to the next day—
\v 27 don't¦130610 let the devil¦130614 get his foot in.
\v 28 If you've been stealing, then stop it. Instead you should be a hard worker, doing good¦130629 things with your hands¦130627, so that you'll \add earn\add* enough to be able to help those who are in need.
\v 29 Don't let any bad¦130639 talk come out of your¦130643 mouths¦130642, but¦130646 rather words that are helpful to encourage others and to show grace¦130656 to them.
\v 30 And don't¦130660 sadden God's pure¦130665 spirit¦130663, because¦130671 he is the one who recorded your names for the day¦130672 when the price will be paid to buy you all back.
\v 31 So get rid of all bitterness¦130675, and rage¦130677 and severe¦130679 anger¦130679, uproars and slander¦130683, and any kind of malice¦130691.
\v 32 \x + \xo 4:32: \xt Col 3:13.\x*Instead, be kind to each other, tender-hearted¦130697, forgiving¦130698 each other just like God¦130703 forgave¦130706 you¦130708 all through \add the work of\add* the messiah¦130705.
\c 5
\s1 Living in God's light
\p
\v 1 So imitate God¦130713 like valued children¦130715 \add would imitate their father\add*
\v 2 \x + \xo 5:2: \xt Exo 29:18; Psa 40:6.\x*and immerse yourselves in love¦130720 just as the messiah¦130724 loves you¦130726 all and allowed himself¦130730 to suffer for us as an offering¦130734 and sacrifice¦130738 which is like a pleasant fragrance¦130744 to God¦130741.
\p
\v 3 It's fitting¦130758 for dedicated \add believers\add* to not even entertain thoughts of sexual¦130745 immorality¦130745 or impurity¦130749 or greed¦130752.
\v 4 Nor is dirty or foolish¦130765 talk¦130765 or crude¦130768 joking¦130768 fitting¦130773, but¦130774 rather¦130775 thankfulness¦130776.
\v 5 You should realise that anyone who is sexually¦130784 immoral¦130784 or impure or is a covetous¦130788 or idolatrous¦130792 person won't have an inheritance¦130795 in the kingdom¦130799 of the messiah¦130801 and¦130802 of God¦130803.
\p
\v 6 Don't let anyone seduce¦130806 you¦130805 with empty¦130808 talk, because¦130810 this is exactly what will induce God's strong anger¦130815 on those who're disobedient.
\v 7 So don't¦130824 get caught up with them
\v 8 because¦130830 you yourselves were once in the darkness¦130832 but now that you are in the master's¦130837 light, you should behave like children¦130839 of light.
\v 9 The results of this light¦130846 should be goodness¦130850 and doing what is right¦130852 and being honest
\v 10 as you \add aim\add* to please¦130858 \add our\add* master¦130860.
\v 11 Don't join in with the works¦130865 of darkness¦130869 which don't¦130862 lead to positive results, but¦130871 instead you all should expose them
\v 12 because¦130875 the things¦130874 that unbelievers do in secret¦130877 are disgraceful to even talk about.
\v 13 But everything¦130893 will \add eventually\add* have the light shone on it and all these things¦130885 will then be exposed. 
\v 14 That's why it says:
\q1 You who're asleep get up,
\q1 You who're dead¦130909 come back to life,
\q2 The messiah¦130914 will shine \add his light\add* on you.
\p
\v 15 Because of that, take great care in exactly¦130919 how you're living. Don't live like fools, but¦130925 like wise people,
\v 16 \x + \xo 5:16: \xt Col 4:5.\x*making good use of your time¦130930, because¦130931 there's lot of evil¦130934 these days¦130933.
\v 17 So don't¦130938 be foolish¦130940, but¦130941 rather \add strive to\add* discover what the master¦130951 wants for you.
\p
\v 18 And don't¦130954 get drunk¦130955 on alchohol because that's excessive. Instead, be filled¦130963 with \add God's\add* spirit¦130966,
\v 19 \x + \xo 5:19-20: \xt Col 3:16-17.\x*sharing scriptures with each other and singing hymns¦130972 and songs¦130974 to praise¦130981 \add our\add* master¦130989,
\v 20 always¦130991 expressing thanks¦130990 for everything to \add our\add* father¦131006 God¦131003 in the authority and name¦130995 of our master¦130997, Yeshua¦131000 the messiah¦131001.
\v 21 And show your honour of the messiah¦131012 by placing yourselves under each other's authority.

\v 23 because¦131024 the husband¦131026 is the leader of the wife¦131031 just like the messiah¦131035 is the head and¦131026 saviour¦131043 of his body¦131045, the church.
\v 24 Wives should place themselves under their¦131059 husbands¦131061 in everything¦131063 just like the church should place itself under the messiah¦131054.
\p
\v 25 \x + \xo 5:25: \xt Col 3:19; 1Pe 3:7.\x*You husbands must love your¦131067 wives¦131068, just like the messiah¦131073 loved¦131074 the church and¦131077 gave¦131079 himself¦131078 \add completely\add* for it,
\v 26 so that he could separate the church \add from the world\add* and wash it clean¦131085 with the water¦131089 of the \add good\add* message¦131091
\v 27 in order to present¦131093 the splendid church to himself¦131096—without any stains¦131104 or wrinkles¦131106 or anything¦131108 like that—just pure¦131114 and¦131115 unblemished.
\v 28 So husbands¦131121 should love their wives¦131126 just like their own bodies¦131131—whoever loves his wife¦131136 is loving himself.
\v 29 No one hates their own body, but¦131147 they feed and¦131149 look after it¦131151, just like the messiah¦131155 does for the church
\v 30 and we¦131161 are parts of his¦131164 body¦131163.
\v 31 \x + \xo 5:31: \xt Gen 2:24.\x*That's the reason why a man¦131177 leaves his father¦131179 and mother¦131183 and becomes joined¦131185 with his wife¦131189 and the two¦131195 of them become one unit.
\v 32 This is an amazing mystery¦131201 but¦131206 I'm talking¦131207 about the messiah¦131209 and¦131210 the church.
\v 33 But it applies to you all: each one of you should love your wife like yourself and the wife should respect her husband¦131234.

\v 2 \x + \xo 6:2-3: \xt Exo 20:12; Deu 5:16.\x*Honour your¦131250 father¦131249 and¦131251 mother¦131253 (that's the first¦131257 commandment¦131256 that's followed by a promise¦131259)

\v 6 Don't just please¦131311 them when they're watching, but¦131312 \add work\add* as slaves¦131314 of the messiah¦131316, genuinely wanting to obey God¦131321
\v 7 by serving the master with good will. When you serve as if serving the master and not people¦131332,
\v 8 whether¦131352 you're a slave¦131353 or free, it's him who will reward you.
\p

\s1 Wear God's armour

\v 11 Wear God's complete armour because¦131411 it will enable you¦131414 to stand¦131415 up against¦131416 the devil's¦131420 schemes¦131418.
\v 12 Our struggle isn't against people, but against rulers, authorities¦131439, the powers of this world's¦131442 darkness¦131444, and the spiritual¦131450 forces of wickedness¦131452 in heavenly¦131455 places.
\v 13 Because¦131456 of that, make use of every piece of God's armour so that you'll be able to resist¦131466 those powers in the evil¦131471 day¦131469 and having¦131474 done everything, to remain standing¦131476.
