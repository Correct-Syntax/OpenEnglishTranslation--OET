\mt2 Paul's letter to the believers in
\mt1 Ephesus
\is1 Introduction
\is2 The author
\ip This \bk Letter to the believers in Ephesus\bk* was written by Paul from prison in Rome.
\is2 This letter
\ip This letter wasn't just written for the assembly of believers there in Ephesus, but also for other assemblies of believers.
\ip Paul's main theme is about God's plan that ‘at the right time he will gather everything, whether in heaven or here on earth, for the messiah’ (1:10).
\ip In the first part of letter, he wrote about unity. Paul carefully explained about how God the father chooses his people, about forgiving and saving them from their sins through his son, Yeshua the messiah.
\ip In the second part of letter, Paul urges the reader that the believers need to be united in the messiah by means of their unity with each other.
\ip Paul uses many allegories about the unity of people with God via the messiah: the believers are the body of the messiah, he is the head; it's like a house, with the messiah as the foundation stone; the believers are also like a bride with the messiah as the groom.
\ip It's also explained here about the correct behaviour for couples, of parents and children, and for slaves and masters. Then in concluding his letter, it's explained about the armour that's given to believers for them to use to stand against Satan's attacks.
\ip It should be noted here that this letter, like most of the scriptures, was dictated to a scribe (See 2 Thess 3:17), so it was an oral letter, quite different from our modern letters which we edit with word-processing software, adding a word back in a previous sentence, combining two short sentences, or breaking an over-long sentence. Oral letters tend to contain a lot of \it run-on sentences\it* where the thoughts keep flowing without a break, thus 1:3-14 is considered by most Greek experts to be one long sentence (like this one is 😀), however for us as readers, a sentence with some two hundred words is very difficult for us to absorb, hence this \em Reader's Version\em* breaks that single Greek sentence into a number of smaller sentences, in fact, this kind of adjustment is regularly done throughout the Bible by all major English translations in order to make them easier for us to read, but the disadvantage is that we can sometimes lose whatever the connection was between the consecutive thoughts. The \em OET\em* tries to be more transparent about such adjustments by placing the \em Literal Version\em* right beside this text so that the serious student can compare the two.

\v 3 We praise \nd God¦128976\nd*, the father¦128978 of our \nd master¦128980 Yeshua¦128984\nd* the messiah.\f + \fr 1:3 \ft Verses 3-14 seem to be just one long, rambling sentence in the Greek, and it's not totally clear what each part means, or how they all connect logically together in sequence. We have split it into smaller sentence chunks to try to help our readers extract some meaning out of it.\f* He is the one who's blessed us with every¦128990 spiritual¦128992 blessing in heavenly¦128995 places—blessings that come from the messiah.
\v 4 He chose¦128999 us to follow him even before¦129003 the creation of the world¦129005, so that we could become pure¦129008 and blameless¦129010 in front¦129011 of him. Because of his¦129011 love¦129014
\v 5 he decided in advance to adopt¦129018 us as his¦129030 children through¦129019 \nd Yeshua¦129021\nd* the \nd messiah¦129022\nd*. His¦129030 decision gave him great pleasure¦129027
\v 6 and now he's praised¦129032 for the greatness of his¦129036 grace¦129035 which¦129039 favoured¦129040 us, as the one he loved¦129044
\v 7 \x + \xo 1:7: \xt Col 1:14.\x*redeemed us by means of his blood¦129053 and forgave our sins. It was from the riches¦129062 of his grace¦129066
\v 8 that was poured onto us that we gain wisdom¦129074 and¦129075 understanding¦129076
\v 9 as he revealed the mystery¦129080 of his will to us according¦129092 to his great pleasure¦129094 as he himself planned.
\v 10 He planned for the orchestration of the times¦129107, and at the right time he will gather everything, whether in heaven¦129119 or here on earth¦129124, for the \nd messiah¦129113\nd*
\v 11 and we¦129130 also have been assigned an inheritance¦129130 in him¦129143. This was also predetermined¦129131 according to God's plan and the decisions of his¦129143 will
\v 12 so that we, the ones who first put our trust in the \nd messiah¦129157\nd*, would praise¦129149 his¦129152 greatness.
\v 13 And you all also, after hearing the message of truth¦129167, the good message about being saved, were confirmed by receiving the \nd spirit¦129180\nd* of pure¦129184 promise¦129182 after you believed¦129176.
\v 14 This spirit is the deposit¦129188 on our¦129191 inheritance¦129190 until we procure¦129195 the freedom which has been bought for us, leading us to praise¦129197 God's greatness.

\v 15 Because¦129201 of that, when I heard¦129204 about your faith¦129208 in the \nd master¦129211 Yeshua¦129213\nd* and¦129214 your \add acceptance\add* of all the pure¦129221 believers,
\v 16 I don't¦129222 stop giving¦129224 thanks¦129224 for all of you, mentioning¦129227 you in my¦129233 prayers¦129232,
\v 17 asking the \nd God¦129236\nd* of our¦129239 \nd master¦129238 Yeshua¦129241\nd* the \nd messiah¦129242\nd* to give¦129247 you¦129249 spiritual¦129250 wisdom¦129251 and¦129252 to reveal the knowledge¦129255 about him¦129256.
\v 18 I ask that your¦129263 inner thoughts will be enlightened¦129257 so that you all will know the expectation of what he's calling¦129274 you too—the riches¦129279 of the greatness of his¦129275 inheritance¦129283 for the believers
\v 19 and the exceeding greatness¦129295 of his power to \add help\add* us who believe¦129302, according¦129303 to the working¦129305 of the power of his strength¦129309.
\v 20 \x + \xo 1:20: \xt Psa 110:1.\x*He worked¦129313 this power in the \nd messiah¦129316\nd* when he brought him back to life and seated him in the place of honour in heavenly¦129334 places—
\v 21 giving him authority¦129340 over every law and government and powerful¦129343 groups and organisations, and over every earthly title, not only in the present age but also in the age to come.
\v 22 \x + \xo 1:22: \xt Psa 8:6.\x*Everything in existence will be under¦129364 his¦129367 authority and God set him in charge of all matters concerning¦129372 the assembly¦129375,
\v 23 which¦129376 is his¦129380 body¦129379—the completeness of the messiah who completes everything.

\p
\v 1 \x + \xo 2:1-5: \xt Col 2:13.\x*You all were dead¦129392 due to your¦129402 disobedience and¦129396 the \add path of\add* sinning
\v 2 that you once walked¦129406 along when you followed the trends of this world¦129411 which \add in turn\add* come from the ruler¦129415 of the invisible powers—he's the spirit¦129421 that works in the children of disobedience.
\v 3 In the past, we also lived like them inside our¦129445 fleshly lusts and then living out those desires and fantasies, and so we were children¦129457 \add deserving\add* strong anger¦129460 just like everyone else.
\p
\v 4 But \nd God¦129467\nd* was generous with his¦129476 mercy¦129471 because¦129472 of the great¦129474 love¦129475 that he loved¦129478 us with,
\v 5 so although we were dead¦129484 as a result of our disobedience, he make us alive¦129492 along with the \nd messiah¦129495\nd*. Yes, we have been saved¦129498 by \add God's\add* grace¦129496.
\v 6 And God lifted us up and sat¦129502 us together¦129502 with \nd Yeshua¦129509\nd* the \nd messiah¦129508\nd* in the heavenly¦129505 \add domains\add*
\v 7 so that for the ages to come, he could display¦129511 the overflowing riches¦129521 of his grace¦129524 through his kindness¦129527 to us via \nd Yeshua¦129533\nd* the \nd messiah¦129532\nd*.
\v 8 It's \add God's\add* grace that allows you all to be saved¦129538 through¦129539 faith¦129541. This grace doesn't come from you, but rather it's a gift¦129549 from God—
\v 9 it doesn't originate from your actions so no one can brag about it.
\v 10 We are God's workmanship¦129561 and he's created¦129562 us to do good¦129568 things by following \nd Yeshua¦129565\nd* the \nd messiah¦129564\nd*. God has already planned these things for us to do.

\p
\v 11 Because of that, don't forget that you¦129583 all were once fleshly unbelievers (nicknamed ‘the uncircumcised¦129590 ones’ by circumcised¦129594 Jews who mark the bodies \add of their males\add* with human hands).
\v 12 At that time¦129602 you were separated from the citizens¦129608 of Israel and were strangers¦129612 to the agreements involving \add God's\add* promise¦129616. You didn't have any future hope as you lived in the world¦129624 without¦129604 \add knowing\add* God.
\p
\v 13 But now \add thanks to\add* \nd Yeshua¦129629\nd* the messiah, you¦129630 all who were once far \add from God\add* have become¦129636 close by means of the messiah's blood¦129640.
\v 14 He is \add the source\add* of peace¦129647 \add between Jews and non-Jews\add*, having broken¦129659 the dividing¦129656 wall that fenced¦129658 them apart and making the two into one. He took the hostility onto himself,
\v 15 \x + \xo 2:15: \xt Col 2:14.\x*having¦129672 declared the \add old \add* commandments¦129669 to be now void so that Jews and non-Jews can now be peaceably¦129686 united.
\v 16 \x + \xo 2:16: \xt Col 1:20.\x*By \add his death\add* on the pole, any hostility is destroyed and¦129688 both groups now become just one body¦129695 in God's sight.
\v 17 \x + \xo 2:17: \xt Isa 57:19.\x*When the messiah came, he announced the good message¦129708: peace to you all who were far \add from God\add*, and peace also to the ones who were near,
\v 18 so now both groups have access¦129727 to the father¦129735 by means of one \nd spirit¦129732\nd* through¦129718 \add the work of\add* the messiah.

\v 19 As a result, you all are no longer¦129738 strangers¦129740 and foreigners, but fellow-citizens¦129745 of the believers and part of God's household¦129749
\v 20 which has been founded¦129755 on the teaching of the missionaries and¦129758 prophets¦129759. The cornerstone¦129761 of this building is \nd Yeshua¦129766\nd* the \nd messiah¦129765\nd*.
\v 21 He joins the entire building¦129771 together¦129772, growing¦129773 us all into a dedicated temple¦129775 for the \nd master¦129778\nd*.
\v 22 You all are being¦129783 built¦129783 together¦129783 by following him, becoming a place¦129785 for God's \nd spirit¦129790\nd* to live in.

\v 1 That's the reason¦129793 that I, Paul¦129795, am a prisoner¦129797 \add due to my serving\add* \nd Yeshua¦129800\nd* the \nd messiah¦129799\nd* for you¦129802 non-Jews¦129804.
\v 2 Certainly you have heard¦129807 that God assigned me the task of passing on God's grace¦129811 to you.
\v 3 He revealed his incredible plan as I wrote¦129829 briefly previously¦129829
\v 4 \x + \xo 3:4-6: \xt Col 1:26-27.\x*and which¦129834 you¦129835 are all able to read to understand¦129837 my¦129840 insight¦129839 into the incredible plan about the \nd messiah¦129845\nd*.
\v 5 This plan wasn't explained to humans in previous generations¦129849 but has now God's \nd spirit¦129866\nd* has revealed¦129858 \nd it\nd* to his¦129862 worthy missionaries and¦129863 prophets¦129864.
\v 6 Now non-Jews¦129869 can have the same inheritance and become members¦129872 of the same body and can share in the same promise¦129876 that was the positive message¦129884 of \nd Yeshua¦129881\nd* the \nd messiah¦129880\nd*.
\p
\v 7 I have become¦129887 a servant¦129888 of that message as a result of the gift¦129891 of God's grace¦129893 that was given¦129898 to me by means of the working¦129903 of his¦129906 power¦129905.
\v 8 Although I was the least¦129911 of the ones dedicated to this message, I was given¦129915 the grace¦129917 to preach¦129922 this positive message to the non-Jews¦129921, to tell them about the endless riches¦129927 of the \nd messiah¦129929\nd*
\v 9 and¦129930 to enlighten¦129931 everyone about the assignment of God's incredible plan. God, the one who created¦129950 everything, hid this plan away over the ages
\v 10 so that the wide-ranging wisdom¦129970 of \nd God¦129972\nd* could be revealed now through¦129965 the church to the rulers¦129958 and¦129959 authorities¦129961 in the heavenly¦129964 realms¦129964.
\v 11 \nd God\nd* did this according¦129973 to his plan for the ages which¦129977 he established¦129978 in our¦129986 \nd master¦129985\nd*, \nd Yeshua¦129983\nd* the \nd messiah¦129982\nd*.
\v 12 It's through our faith¦129999 in Yeshua that we¦129989 can have boldness¦129991 and¦129992 confident¦129996 access¦129994 \add to God\add*.
\v 13 Because of that, I'm asking you not to become discouraged over my¦130009 current difficulties as I \add serve\add* you all, in fact you are honoured by them.

\p
\v 14 That's why I'm kneeling to \add ask\add* the father¦130026
\v 15 (the one that every¦130034 father in the heavens¦130037 and¦130038 on earth¦130040 is named¦130041 after)
\v 16 that he would cause you to be strengthened¦130055 inside¦130062 your minds by the power¦130054 of his \nd spirit¦130058\nd* and from the riches¦130049 of his greatness.
\v 17 Through \add your\add* faith¦130069, the \nd messiah¦130066\nd* can live in your hearts¦130072 so that love¦130075 will become your root and¦130077 foundation
\v 18 so that just like the dedicated ones, you¦130080 all will also be strong enough to understand the width and length¦130092 and height¦130094 and depth¦130097 of
\v 19 the \nd messiah's¦130108\nd* love, and to know¦130099 that having this love exceeds having knowledge¦130105 so that you all can be filled¦130110 with God's completeness.
\p
\v 20-21 Now we offer praise to \add God\add* in the church and for all the generations to come and to Yeshua the messiah—\add God\add* who, through the power¦130131 that works in us, is able to do far more than we can ask for or even understand¦130128. May it be so.

\p
\v 7 Yet each one of us has been given¦130236 a measure¦130241 of grace¦130238 as a gift¦130243 from the \nd messiah¦130245\nd*,
\v 8 just as it was written,
\q1 “When he ascended to heaven,

\v 9 Of course, he couldn't ascend if he hadn't first descended down to earth¦130277.
\v 10 So the one who descended is the very one who also ascended above¦130285 all the heavens¦130288 so that he could fill¦130290 all locations.
\v 11 Then he gave¦130295 some as missionaries, some as prophets¦130302, some as announcers of the good¦130305 message¦130305, some as pastors and teachers¦130310
\v 12 so as to complete¦130313 the dedicated ones for the work¦130318 of service¦130318—for building¦130320 the body¦130322 of the \nd messiah¦130324\nd*

\v 17 So I'll say this at the \nd master's¦130439\nd* direction: you¦130441 all are no longer¦130440 to walk¦130442 like \add unbelieving\add* pagans¦130447 who \add trust\add* in their¦130453 own futile thinking.
\v 18 Their¦130476 minds have been darkened¦130454 because their ignorance¦130466 has drawn them away from the life¦130461 of \nd God¦130463\nd* due to the hardening¦130473 of their hearts¦130475.
\v 19 They stopped caring \add about what's right and wrong\add*, and then greedily¦130489 indulged themselves¦130479 in their own impure¦130486 lusts.
\p
\v 20 But you¦130490 all didn't learn¦130494 that about the \nd messiah¦130496\nd*.
\v 21 If you had heard him and listened to his teaching, you would have heard the truth¦130507 from \nd Yeshua¦130510\nd*:
\v 22 \x + \xo 4:22: \xt Col 3:9.\x*that you reject the former conduct¦130518 of the old corrupted¦130523 you, those seductive¦130528 desires¦130526,
