\mt2 Paul's letter to the
\mt1 believers in Ephesus
\is1 Introduction
\is2 The author
\ip This \bk Letter to the believers in Ephesus\bk* was written by Paul from prison in Rome.
\is2 This letter
\ip This letter wasn't just written for the assembly of believers there in Ephesus, but also for other assemblies of believers.
\ip Paul's main theme is about God's plan that “at the right time he will gather everything, whether in heaven or here on earth, for the messiah” (1:10).
\ip In the first part of letter, he wrote about unity. Paul carefully explained about how God the father chooses his people, about forgiving and saving them from their sins through his son, Yeshua the messiah.
\ip In the second part of letter, Paul urges the reader that the believers need to be united in the messiah by means of their unity with each other.
\ip Paul uses many allegories about the unity of people with God via the messiah: the believers are the body of the messiah, he is the head; it's like a house, with the messiah as the foundation stone; the believers are also like a bride with the messiah as the groom.
\ip It's also explained here about the correct behaviour of couples, of parents and children, and of slaves and master. Then in concluding his letter, it's explained about the armour that's given to believers for them to use to stand against Satan's attacks.

\v 3 We praise God¦128976, the father¦128978 of our master¦128980 Yeshua¦128984 the messiah.\f + \fr 1:3 \ft Verses 3-14 seem to be just one long, rambling sentence in the Greek, and it's not totally clear what each part means, or how they all connect logically together in sequence. We have split it into smaller sentence chunks to try to help our readers extract some meaning out of it.\f* He is the one who's blessed us with every¦128990 spiritual¦128992 blessing in heavenly¦128995 places—blessings that come from the messiah.
\v 4 He chose¦128999 us to follow him even before¦129003 the creation of the world¦129005, so that we could become pure¦129008 and blameless¦129010 in front¦129011 of him. Because of his¦129011 love¦129014
\v 5 he decided in advance to adopt¦129018 us as his¦129030 children through¦129019 Yeshua¦129021 the messiah¦129022. His¦129030 decision gave him great pleasure¦129027
\v 6 and now he's praised¦129032 for the greatness of his¦129036 grace¦129035 which¦129039 favoured¦129040 us, as the one he loved¦129044
\v 7 \x + \xo 1:7: \xt Col 1:14.\x*redeemed us by means of his blood¦129053 and forgave our sins. It was from the riches¦129062 of his grace¦129066
\v 8 that was poured onto us that we gain wisdom¦129074 and¦129075 understanding¦129076
\v 9 as he revealed the mystery¦129080 of his will to us according¦129092 to his great pleasure¦129094 as he himself planned.
\v 10 He planned for the orchestration of the times¦129107, and at the right time he will gather everything, whether in heaven¦129119 or here on earth¦129124, for the messiah¦129113
\v 11 and we¦129130 also have been assigned an inheritance¦129130 in him¦129143. This was also predetermined¦129131 according to God's plan and the decisions of his¦129143 will
\v 12 so that we, the ones who first put our trust in the messiah¦129157, would praise¦129149 his¦129152 greatness.
\v 13 And you all also, after hearing the message of truth¦129167, the good message about being saved, were confirmed by receiving the spirit¦129180 of pure¦129184 promise¦129182 after you believed¦129176.
\v 14 This spirit is the deposit¦129188 on our¦129191 inheritance¦129190 until we procure¦129195 the freedom which has been bought for us, leading us to praise¦129197 God's greatness.

\v 15 Because¦129201 of that, when I heard¦129204 about your faith¦129208 in the master¦129211 Yeshua¦129213 and¦129214 your \add acceptance\add* of all the pure¦129221 believers,
\v 16 I don't¦129222 stop giving¦129224 thanks¦129224 for all of you, mentioning¦129227 you in my¦129233 prayers¦129232,
\v 17 asking the God¦129236 of our¦129239 master¦129238 Yeshua¦129241 the messiah¦129242 to give¦129247 you¦129249 spiritual¦129250 wisdom¦129251 and¦129252 to reveal the knowledge¦129255 about him¦129256.
\v 18 I ask that your¦129263 inner thoughts will be enlightened¦129257 so that you all will know the expectation of what he's calling¦129274 you too—the riches¦129279 of the greatness of his¦129275 inheritance¦129283 for the believers
\v 19 and the exceeding greatness¦129295 of his power to \add help\add* us who believe¦129302, according¦129303 to the working¦129305 of the power of his strength¦129309.
\v 20 \x + \xo 1:20: \xt Psa 110:1.\x*He worked¦129313 this power in the messiah¦129316 when he brought him back to life and seated him in the place of honour in heavenly¦129334 places—
\v 21 giving him authority¦129340 over every law and government and powerful¦129343 groups and organisations, and over every earthly title, not only in the present age but also in the age to come.
\v 22 \x + \xo 1:22: \xt Psa 8:6.\x*Everything in existence will be under¦129364 his¦129367 authority and God set him in charge of all matters concerning¦129372 the assembly¦129375,
\v 23 which¦129376 is his¦129380 body¦129379—the completeness of the messiah who completes everything.

\p
\v 1 \x + \xo 2:1-5: \xt Col 2:13.\x*You all were dead¦129392 due to your¦129402 disobedience and¦129396 the \add path of\add* sinning
\v 2 that you once walked¦129406 along when you followed the trends of this world¦129411 which¦129404 \add in turn\add* come from the ruler¦129415 of the invisible powers—he's the spirit¦129421 that works in the children of disobedience.
\v 3 In the past, we also lived like them inside our¦129445 fleshly lusts and then living out those desires and fantasies, and so we were children¦129457 \add deserving\add* strong anger¦129460 just like everyone else.
\p
\v 4 But God¦129467 was generous with his¦129476 mercy¦129471 because¦129472 of the great¦129474 love¦129475 that he loved¦129478 us with,
\v 5 so although we were dead¦129484 as a result of our disobedience, he make us alive¦129492 along with the messiah¦129495. Yes, we have been saved¦129498 by \add God's\add* grace¦129496.
\v 6 And God lifted us up and sat¦129502 us together¦129502 with Yeshua¦129509 the messiah¦129508 in the heavenly¦129505 \add domains\add*
\v 7 so that for the ages to come, he could display¦129511 the overflowing riches¦129521 of his grace¦129524 through his kindess to us via Yeshua¦129533 the messiah¦129532.
\v 8 It's \add God's\add* grace that allows you all to be saved¦129538 through¦129539 faith¦129541. This grace doesn't come from you, but rather it's a gift¦129549 from God—
\v 9 it doesn't originate from your actions so no one can brag about it.
\v 10 We are God's workmanship¦129561 and he's created¦129562 us to do good¦129568 things by following Yeshua¦129565 the messiah¦129564. God has already planned these things for us to do.

\p
\v 11 Because of that, don't forget that you¦129583 all were once fleshly unbelievers (nicknamed ‘the uncircumcized¦129590 ones’ by circumsized¦129594 Jews who mark the bodies \add of their males\add* with human hands).
\v 12 At that time¦129602 you were separated from the citizens¦129608 of Israel and were strangers¦129612 to the agreements involving \add God's\add* promise¦129616. You didn't have any future hope as you lived in the world¦129624 without¦129604 \add knowing\add* God.
\p
\v 13 But now \add thanks to\add* Yeshua¦129629 the messiah, you¦129630 all who were once far \add from God\add* have become¦129636 close by means of the messiah's blood¦129640.
\v 14 He is \add the source\add* of peace¦129647 \add between Jews and non-Jews\add*, having broken¦129659 the dividing¦129656 wall that fenced¦129658 them apart and making the two into one. He took the hostility onto himself,
\v 15 \x + \xo 2:15: \xt Col 2:14.\x*having¦129672 declared the \add old \add* commandments¦129669 to be now void so that Jews and non-Jews can now be peaceably¦129686 united.
\v 16 \x + \xo 2:16: \xt Col 1:20.\x*By \add his death\add* on the pole, any hostility is destroyed and¦129688 both groups now become just one body¦129695 in God's sight.
\v 17 \x + \xo 2:17: \xt Isa 57:19.\x*When the messiah came, he announced the good message¦129708: peace to you all who were far \add from God\add*, and peace also to the ones who were near,
\v 18 so now both groups have access¦129727 to the father¦129735 by means of one spirit¦129732 through¦129718 \add the work of\add* the messiah.

\p
\v 19 As a result, you all are no longer¦129738 strangers¦129740 and foreigners, but fellow-citizens¦129745 of the believers and part of God's household¦129749
\v 20 which has been founded¦129755 on the teaching of the missionaries and¦129758 prophets¦129759. The cornerstone¦129761 of this building is Yeshua¦129766 the messiah¦129765.
\v 21 He joins the entire building¦129771 together¦129772, growing¦129773 us all into a dedicated temple¦129775 for the master¦129778.
\v 22 You all are being¦129783 built¦129783 together¦129783 by following him, becoming a place¦129785 for God's spirit¦129790 to live in.

\v 1 That's the reason¦129793 that I, Paul¦129795, am a prisoner¦129797 \add due to my serving\add* Yeshua¦129800 the messiah¦129799 for you¦129802 non-Jews¦129804.
\v 2 Certainly you have heard¦129807 that God assigned me the task of passing on God's grace¦129811 to you.
\v 3 He revealed his incredible plan as I wrote¦129829 briefly previously¦129829
\v 4 \x + \xo 3:4-6: \xt Col 1:26-27.\x*and¦129837 which¦129834 you¦129835 are all able to read to understand¦129837 my¦129840 insight¦129839 into the incredible plan about the messiah¦129845.
\v 5 This plan wasn't explained to humans in in previous generations¦129849 but has now God's spirit¦129866 has revealed¦129858 it¦129866 to his¦129862 worthy missionaries and¦129863 prophets¦129864.
\v 6 Now non-Jews¦129869 can have the same inheritance and become members¦129872 of the same body¦129872 and can share in the same promise¦129876 that was the positive message¦129884 of Yeshua¦129881 the messiah¦129880.
\p
\v 7 I have become¦129887 a servant¦129888 of that message as a result of the gift¦129891 of God's grace¦129893 that was given¦129898 to me by means of the working¦129903 of his¦129906 power¦129905.
\v 8 Although I was the least¦129911 of the ones dedicated to this message, I was given¦129915 the grace¦129917 to preach¦129922 this positive message to the non-Jews¦129921, to tell them about the endless riches¦129927 of the messiah¦129929
\v 9 and¦129930 to enlighten¦129931 everyone about the assignment of God's incredible plan. God, the one who created¦129950 everything, hid this plan away over the ages
\v 10 so that the wide-ranging wisdom¦129970 of God¦129972 could be revealed now through¦129965 the church to the rulers¦129958 and¦129959 authorities¦129961 in the heavenly¦129964 realms¦129964.
\v 11 God did this according¦129973 to his plan for the ages which¦129977 he established¦129978 in our¦129986 master¦129985, Yeshua¦129983 the messiah¦129982.
\v 12 It's through our faith¦129999 in Yeshua that we¦129989 can have boldness¦129991 and¦129992 confident¦129996 access¦129994 \add to God\add*.
\v 13 Because of that, I'm asking you not to become discouraged over my¦130009 current difficulties as I \add serve\add* you all, in fact you are honoured by them.

\p
\v 14 That's why I'm kneeling to \add ask\add* the father¦130026
\v 15 (the one that every¦130034 father in the heavens¦130037 and¦130038 on earth¦130040 is named¦130041 after)
\v 16 that he would cause you to be strengthened¦130055 inside¦130062 your minds by the power¦130054 of his spirit¦130058 and from the riches¦130049 of his greatness.
\v 17 Through \add your\add* faith¦130069, the messiah¦130066 can live in your hearts¦130072 so that love¦130075 will become your root and¦130077 foundation
\v 18 so that just like the dedicated ones, you¦130080 all will also be strong enough to understand the width and length¦130092 and height¦130094 and depth¦130097 of
\v 19 the messiah's¦130108 love, and to know¦130099 that having this love exceeds having knowledge¦130105 so that you all can be filled¦130110 with God's completeness.
\p
\v 20-21 Now we offer praise to \add God\add* in the church and for all the generations to come and to Yeshua the messiah—\add God\add* who, through the power¦130131 that works in us, is able to do far more than we can ask for or even understand¦130128. May it be so.

\v 1 Because of that, I, a prisoner¦130161 for the master¦130163, am urging you all to walk¦130166 worthily¦130165 of the calling¦130168 to which¦130169 you were called¦130170
\v 2 \x + \xo 4:2: \xt Col 3:12-13.\x*with all humility¦130173, gentleness¦130175, and¦130174 patience¦130178, putting up with one another¦130180 because of your love¦130182 \add for them\add*,
\v 3 being¦130183 serious about keeping¦130184 the unity of \add God's\add* spirit¦130188 in the bond of peace¦130193.
\v 4 There is one body¦130195 and one spirit¦130198, just as you all were called to one hope when you were called.
\v 5 There's one master¦130210, one \add system of\add* faith¦130212, one immersion¦130214,
\v 6 one God¦130216 and father¦130218 of all who is over all and through¦130224 all and in all.
\p
\v 7 Yet each one of us has been given¦130236 a measure¦130241 of grace¦130238 as a gift¦130243 from the messiah¦130245,
\v 8 just as it was written,
\q1 “When he ascended to heaven,
\q2 he eliminated captivity¦130253
\q2 and gave¦130255 gifts¦130256 to people¦130259.”\x + \xo 4:8: \xt Psa 68:18.\x*
\m
\v 9 Of course, he couldn't ascend if he hadn't first descended down to earth¦130277.
\v 10 So the one who descended is the very one who also ascended above¦130285 all the heavens¦130288 so that he could fill¦130290 all locations.
\v 11 Then he gave¦130295 some as missionaries, some as prophets¦130302, some as announcers of the good¦130305 message¦130305, some as pastors and teachers¦130310
\v 12 so as to complete¦130313 the dedicated ones for the work¦130318 of service¦130318—for building¦130320 the body¦130322 of the messiah¦130324
\v 13 until¦130325 we¦130326 can reach the unity of our faith¦130333 and¦130334 of our knowledge¦130336 about God's son—becoming mature¦130343 people measured¦130345 against the stature¦130346 of the fullness¦130348 of the messiah¦130350.
\v 14 Then we'll no longer¦130352 be \add like\add* children \add in our faith\add*, tossed¦130356 around by waves¦130356 and¦130357 being blown by every¦130359 wind¦130361 of teaching¦130363 used to trick¦130366 us or by crafty¦130370 people¦130368 who scheme¦130375 how to deceive us.
\v 15 Instead, by lovingly speaking the truth¦130381, we¦130385 will grow up into every aspect of him¦130387—the messiah¦130397 who is the head

\v 17 So I'll say this at the master's¦130439 direction: you¦130441 all are no longer¦130440 to walk¦130442 like \add unbelieving\add* pagans¦130447 who \add trust\add* in their¦130453 own futile thinking.
\v 18 Their¦130476 minds have been darkened¦130454 because their ignorance¦130466 has drawn them away from the life¦130461 of God¦130463 due to the hardening¦130473 of their hearts¦130475.
\v 19 They stopped caring \add about what's right and wrong\add*, and then greedily¦130489 indulged themselves¦130479 in their own impure¦130486 lusts.
\p
\v 20 But you¦130490 all didn't learn¦130494 that about the messiah¦130496.
\v 21 If you had heard him and listened to his teaching, you would have heard the truth¦130507 from Yeshua¦130510:
\v 22 \x + \xo 4:22: \xt Col 3:9.\x*that you reject the former conduct¦130518 of the old corrupted¦130523 you, those seductive¦130528 desires¦130526,
\v 23 and¦130531 allow the spirit¦130534 driving your¦130537 thoughts to be renewed¦130529
\v 24 \x + \xo 4:24: a \xt Col 3:10; \xo b \xt Gen 1:26.\x*and so to remodel yourself as a godly person¦130543 created¦130547 to obey God¦130546 and follow the pure truth¦130555.

\v 25 \x + \xo 4:25: \xt Zech 8:16.\x*So steer clear of lies—always speak¦130560 the truth¦130561 to those around you because¦130570 we¦130572 are members¦130575 of each other.
\v 26 \x + \xo 4:26: \xt Psa 4:4 (LXX).\x*Even when you're angry, don't sin, and¦130577 don't carry your¦130587 anger¦130586 through to the next day—
\v 27 don't¦130589 let the devil¦130593 get his foot in.
\v 28 If you've been stealing, then stop it. Instead you should be a hard worker, doing good¦130608 things with your hands¦130606, so that you'll \add earn\add* enough to be able to help those who are in need.
\v 29 Don't let any bad¦130618 talk come out of your¦130622 mouths¦130621, but¦130625 rather words that are helpful to encourage others and to show grace¦130635 to them.
\v 30 And don't¦130639 sadden God's pure¦130644 spirit¦130642, because¦130650 he is the one who recorded your names for the day¦130651 when the price will be paid to buy you all back.
\v 31 So get rid of all bitterness¦130654, and rage¦130656 and severe¦130658 anger¦130658, uproars and slander¦130662, and any kind of malice¦130670.

\v 3 It's fitting¦130737 for dedicated \add believers\add* to not even entertain thoughts of sexual¦130724 immorality¦130724 or impurity¦130728 or greed¦130731.
\v 4 Nor is dirty or foolish¦130744 talk¦130744 or crude¦130747 joking¦130747 fitting¦130752, but¦130753 rather¦130754 thankfulness¦130755.
\v 5 You should realise that anyone who is sexually¦130763 immoral¦130763 or impure or is a covetous¦130767 or idolatrous¦130771 person won't have an inheritance¦130774 in the kingdom¦130778 of the messiah¦130780 and¦130781 of God¦130782.
\p
\v 6 Don't let anyone seduce¦130785 you¦130784 with empty¦130787 talk, because¦130789 this is exactly what will induce God's strong anger¦130794 on those who're disobedient.
\v 7 So don't¦130803 get caught up with them
\v 8 because¦130809 you yourselves were once in the darkness¦130811 but now that you are in the master's¦130816 light, you should behave like children¦130818 of light.
\v 9 The results of this light¦130825 should be goodness¦130829 and doing what is right¦130831 and being honest
\v 10 as you \add aim\add* to please¦130837 \add our\add* master¦130839.
\v 11 Don't join in with the works¦130844 of darkness¦130848 which don't¦130841 lead to positive results, but¦130850 instead you all should expose them
\v 12 because¦130854 the things¦130853 that unbelievers do in secret¦130856 are disgraceful to even talk about.
\v 13 But everything¦130872 will \add eventually\add* have the light shone on it and all these things¦130864 will then be exposed.
\v 14 That's why it says:
\q1 You who're asleep get up,
\q1 You who're dead¦130888 come back to life,
\q2 The messiah¦130893 will shine \add his light\add* on you.

\v 15 Because of that, take great care in exactly¦130898 how you're living. Don't live like fools, but¦130904 like wise people,

\p
\v 18 And don't¦130933 get drunk¦130934 on alchohol because that's excessive. Instead, be filled¦130942 with \add God's\add* spirit¦130945,

\v 23 because¦131003 the husband¦131005 is the leader of the wife¦131010 just like the messiah¦131014 is the head and¦131005 saviour¦131022 of his body¦131024, the church.
\v 24 Wives should place themselves under their¦131038 husbands¦131040 in everything¦131042 just like the church should place itself under the messiah¦131033.
\p
\v 25 \x + \xo 5:25: \xt Col 3:19; 1Pe 3:7.\x*You husbands must love your¦131046 wives¦131047, just like the messiah¦131052 loved¦131053 the church and¦131056 gave¦131058 himself¦131057 \add completely\add* for it,
\v 26 so that he could separate the church \add from the world\add* and wash it clean¦131064 with the water¦131068 of the \add good\add* message¦131070
\v 27 in order to present¦131072 the splendid church to himself¦131075—without any stains¦131083 or wrinkles¦131085 or anything¦131087 like that—just pure¦131093 and¦131094 unblemished.
\v 28 So husbands¦131100 should love their wives¦131105 just like their own bodies¦131110—anyone who loves his wife¦131115 is loving himself.
\v 29 No one hates their own body, but¦131126 they feed and¦131128 look after it¦131130, just like the messiah¦131134 does for the church
\v 30 and we¦131140 are parts of his¦131143 body¦131142.
\v 31 \x + \xo 5:31: \xt Gen 2:24.\x*That's the reason why a man¦131156 leaves his father¦131158 and mother¦131162 and becomes joined¦131164 with his wife¦131168 and the two¦131174 of them become one unit.
\v 32 This is an amazing mystery¦131180 but¦131185 I'm talking¦131186 about the messiah¦131188 and¦131189 the church.
\v 33 But it applies to you all: each one of you should love your wife like yourself and the wife should respect her husband¦131213.
