\v 1 \x + \xo 1:1: \xt Acts 18:19-21; 19:1.\x*\add This letter is from\add* Paul, a missionary of Jesus the messiah by the will of God.
\p To the godly people \add there in Ephesus\add* who are faithful to Jesus the messiah.
\p
\v 2 May our father God and our master Jesus the messiah give grace and peace to you all.
\s1 Spiritual blessings
\p
\v 3 We praise God, the father of our master Jesus the messiah.\f + \fr 1:3 \ft Verses 3-14 seem to be just one long, rambling sentence in the Greek, and it’s not totally clear what each part means, or how they all connect logically together in sequence. We have split it into smaller sentence chunks to try to help our readers extract some meaning out of it.\f* He is the one who’s blessed us with every spiritual blessing in heavenly places—blessings that come from the messiah.
\v 4 He chose us to follow him even before the creation of the world, so that we could become pure and blameless in front of him. Because of his love
\v 5 he decided in advance to adopt us as his children through Jesus the messiah. His decision gave him great pleasure
\v 6 and now he’s praised for the greatness of his grace which favoured us, as the one he loved
\v 7 \x + \xo 1:7: \xt Col 1:14.\x*redeemed us by means of his blood and forgave our sins. It was from the riches of his grace
\v 8 that was poured onto us that we gain wisdom and understanding
\v 9 as he revealed the mystery of his will to us according to his great pleasure as he himself planned.
\v 10 He planned for the orchestration of the times, and at the right time he will gather everything, whether in heaven or here on earth, for the messiah
\v 11 and we also have been assigned an inheritance in him. This was also predetermined according to God’s plan and the decisions of his will
\v 12 so that we, the ones who first put our trust in the messiah, would praise his greatness.
\v 13 And you all also, after hearing the message of truth, the good message about being saved, were confirmed by receiving the spirit of pure promise after you believed.
\v 14 This spirit is the deposit on our inheritance until we procure the freedom which has been bought for us, leading us to praise God’s greatness.
\s1 Paul’s prayer for them
\p
\v 15 Because of that, when I heard about your faith in the master Jesus and your \add acceptance\add* of all the pure believers, 
\v 16 I don’t stop giving thanks for all of you, mentioning you in my prayers,
\v 17 asking the God of our master Jesus the messiah to give you spiritual wisdom and to reveal the knowledge about him.
\v 18 I ask that your inner thoughts will be enlightened so that you all will know the expectation of what he’s calling you too--the riches of the greatness of his inheritance for the believers
\v 19 and the exceeding greatness of his power to \add help\add* us who believe, according to the working of the power of his strength.
\v 20 \x + \xo 1:20: \xt Psa 110:1.\x*He worked this power in the messiah when he brought him back to life and seated him in the place of honour in heavenly places--
\v 21 giving him authority over every law and government and powerful groups and organisations, and over every earthly title, not only in the present age but also in the age to come.
\v 22 \x + \xo 1:22: \xt Psa 8:6.\x*Everything in existence will be under his authority and God set him in charge of all matters concerning the assembly,
\v 23 which is his body--the completeness of the messiah who completes everything.
