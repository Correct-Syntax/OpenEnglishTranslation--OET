\mt2 Paul's letter to the 
\mt1 believers in Ephesus
\is1 Introduction
\is2 The author
\ip This \bk Letter to the believers in Ephesus\bk* was written by Paul from prison in Rome.
\is2 This letter
\ip This letter wasn't just written for the assembly of believers there in Ephesus, but also for other assemblies of believers.
\ip Paul's main theme is about God's plan that “at the right time he will gather everything, whether in heaven or here on earth, for the messiah” (1:10).
\ip In the first part of letter, he wrote about unity. Paul carefully explained about how God the father chooses his people, about forgiving and saving them from their sins through his son, Jesus the messiah.
\ip In the second part of letter, Paul urges the reader that the believers need to be united in the messiah by means of their unity with each other.
\ip Paul uses many allegories about the unity of people with God via the messiah: the believers are the body of the messiah, he is the head; it's like a house, with the messiah as the foundation stone; the believers are also like a bride with the messiah as the groom.
\ip It's also explained here about the correct behaviour of couples, of parents and children, and of slaves and master. Then in concluding his letter, it's explained about the armour that's given to believers for them to use to stand against Satan's attacks.

\v 1 \x + \xo 1:1: \xt Acts 18:19-21; 19:1.\x*\add This letter is from\add* Paul, a missionary of Jesus the messiah by the will of God.
\p To the godly people \add there in Ephesus\add* who are faithful to Jesus the messiah.
\p
\v 2 May our father¦128988 God and our master¦128991 Jesus the messiah give grace¦128982 and peace¦128985 to you¦128983 all.
\s1 Spiritual blessings
\p
\v 3 We praise God, the father¦128998 of our master¦129000 Jesus the messiah.\f + \fr 1:3 \ft Verses 3-14 seem to be just one long, rambling sentence in the Greek, and it's not totally clear what each part means, or how they all connect logically together in sequence. We have split it into smaller sentence chunks to try to help our readers extract some meaning out of it.\f* He is the one who's blessed us with every spiritual blessing in heavenly places—blessings that come from the messiah.
\v 4 He chose¦129019 us to follow him even before the creation of the world, so that we could become pure and blameless in front of him. Because of his love
\v 5 he decided in advance to adopt us as his children through Jesus the messiah. His decision gave him great pleasure
\v 6 and now he's praised for the greatness of his grace¦129055 which favoured us, as the one he loved
\v 7 \x + \xo 1:7: \xt Col 1:14.\x*redeemed us by means of his blood¦129073 and forgave our sins. It was from the riches of his grace¦129086
\v 8 that was poured onto us that we gain wisdom and¦129095 understanding
\v 9 as he revealed the mystery of his will to us according to his great pleasure as he himself planned.
\v 10 He planned for the orchestration of the times¦129127, and at the right time he will gather everything, whether in heaven or here on earth, for the messiah
\v 11 and we¦129150 also have been assigned an inheritance in him¦129163. This was also predetermined according to God's plan and the decisions of his will
\v 12 so that we, the ones who first put our trust in the messiah, would praise¦129169 his greatness.
\v 13 And you all also, after hearing the message of truth, the good message about being saved, were confirmed by receiving the spirit of pure promise¦129202 after you believed.
\v 14 This spirit is the deposit on our inheritance until we procure the freedom which has been bought for us, leading us to praise¦129217 God's greatness.
\s1 Paul's prayer for them
\p
\v 15 Because of that, when I heard¦129224 about your faith¦129228 in the master¦129231 Jesus and¦129234 your \add acceptance\add* of all the pure believers, 
\v 16 I don't stop giving¦129244 thanks for all of you, mentioning you in my prayers¦129252,
\v 17 asking the God of our master¦129258 Jesus the messiah to give¦129267 you¦129269 spiritual wisdom and¦129272 to reveal the knowledge about him¦129276.
\v 18 I ask that your inner thoughts will be enlightened so that you all will know the expectation of what he's calling you too—the riches of the greatness of his inheritance for the believers
\v 19 and the exceeding greatness of his power to \add help\add* us who believe, according to the working of the power of his strength.
\v 20 \x + \xo 1:20: \xt Psa 110:1.\x*He worked this power in the messiah when he brought him back to life and seated him in the place of honour in heavenly places—
\v 21 giving him authority¦129360 over every law and government and powerful groups and organisations, and over every earthly title, not only in the present age but also in the age to come.
\v 22 \x + \xo 1:22: \xt Psa 8:6.\x*Everything in existence will be under his authority and God set him in charge of all matters concerning the assembly¦129395,
\v 23 which is his body¦129399—the completeness of the messiah who completes everything.
\c 2
\s1 God's mercy, grace, and plans for us
\p
\v 1 \x + \xo 2:1-5: \xt Col 2:13.\x*You all were dead¦129412 due to your disobedience and¦129416 the \add path of\add* sinning
\v 2 that you once walked¦129426 along when you followed the trends of this world which \add in turn\add* come from the ruler¦129435 of the invisible powers—he's the spirit¦129441 that works in the children of disobedience.
\v 3 In the past, we also lived like them inside our fleshly lusts and then living out those desires and fantasies, and so we were children¦129477 \add deserving\add* strong anger¦129480 just like everyone else.
\p
\v 4 But God was generous with his mercy¦129491 because of the great love¦129495 that he loved¦129498 us with,
\v 5 so although we were dead¦129504 as a result of our disobedience, he make us alive¦129512 along with the messiah. Yes, we have been saved¦129518 by \add God's\add* grace¦129516.
\v 6 And God lifted us up and sat¦129522 us together with Jesus the messiah in the heavenly \add domains\add*
\v 7 so that for the ages to come, he could display the overflowing riches of his grace¦129544 through his kindess to us via Jesus¦129553 the messiah.
\v 8 It's \add God's\add* grace that allows you all to be saved through faith¦129561. This grace doesn't come from you, but rather it's a gift¦129569 from God—
\v 9 it doesn't originate from your actions so no one can brag about it.
\v 10 We are God's workmanship and he's created us to do good¦129588 things by following Jesus the messiah. God has already planned these things for us to do.
\s1 Jews and non-Jews can be united
\p
\v 11 Because of that, don't forget that you¦129603 all were once fleshly unbelievers (nicknamed ‘the uncircumcized ones’ by circumsized Jews who mark the bodies \add of their males\add* with human hands).
\v 12 At that time¦129622 you were separated from the citizens of Israel and were strangers to the agreements involving \add God's\add* promise¦129636. You didn't have any future hope as you lived in the world without \add knowing\add* God.
\p
\v 13 But now \add thanks to\add* Jesus the messiah, you¦129650 all who were once far \add from God\add* have become¦129656 close by means of the messiah's blood¦129660.
\v 14 He is \add the source\add* of peace¦129667 \add between Jews and non-Jews\add*, having broken the dividing wall that fenced them apart and making the two into one. He took the hostility onto himself,
\v 15 \x + \xo 2:15: \xt Col 2:14.\x*having declared the \add old \add* commandments to be now void so that Jews and non-Jews can now be peaceably united.
\v 16 \x + \xo 2:16: \xt Col 1:20.\x*By \add his death\add* on the pole, any hostility is destroyed and¦129708 both groups now become just one body¦129715 in God's sight.
\v 17 \x + \xo 2:17: \xt Isa 57:19.\x*When the messiah came, he announced the good message¦129728: peace to you all who were far \add from God\add*, and peace also to the ones who were near,
\v 18 so now both groups have access to the father¦129755 by means of one spirit¦129752 through \add the work of\add* the messiah.
\p
\v 19 As a result, you all are no longer strangers and foreigners, but fellow-citizens of the believers and part of God's household
\v 20 which has been founded on the teaching of the ambassadors¦129777 and¦129778 prophets. The cornerstone of this building is Jesus the messiah.
\v 21 He joins the entire building together, growing us all into a dedicated temple for the master¦129798.
\v 22 You all are being built together by following him, becoming a place¦129805 for God's spirit¦129810 to live in.
\c 3
\s1 Paul's assignment to non-Jews
\p
\v 1 That's the reason that I, Paul, am a prisoner \add due to my serving\add* Jesus the messiah for you¦129822 non-Jews.
\v 2 Certainly you have heard¦129827 that God assigned me the task of passing on God's grace¦129831 to you.
\v 3 He revealed his incredible plan as I wrote¦129849 briefly previously
\v 4 \x + \xo 3:4-6: \xt Col 1:26-27.\x*and¦129857 which you¦129855 are all able to read to understand my insight into the incredible plan about the messiah.
\v 5 This plan wasn't explained to humans in in previous generations¦129869 but has now God's spirit¦129886 has revealed it¦129886 to his worthy ambassadors¦129881 and¦129883 prophets.
\v 6 Now non-Jews can have the same inheritance and become members of the same body¦129892 and can share in the same promise¦129896 that was the positive message¦129904 of Jesus¦129901 the messiah.
\p
\v 7 I have become¦129907 a servant¦129908 of that message as a result of the gift¦129911 of God's grace¦129913 that was given to me by means of the working of his power¦129925.
\v 8 Although I was the least of the ones dedicated to this message, I was given the grace¦129937 to preach this positive message to the non-Jews, to tell them about the endless riches of the messiah
\v 9 and¦129950 to enlighten everyone about the assignment of God's incredible plan. God, the one who created everything, hid this plan away over the ages
\v 10 so that the wide-ranging wisdom of God could be revealed now through the church to the rulers¦129978 and¦129979 authorities¦129981 in the heavenly realms.
\v 11 God did this according to his plan for the ages which he established in our master¦130005, Jesus¦130003 the messiah.
\v 12 It's through our faith¦130019 in Jesus that we¦130009 can have boldness and¦130012 confident access \add to God\add*.
\v 13 Because of that, I'm asking you not to become discouraged over my current difficulties as I \add serve\add* you all, in fact you are honoured by them.
\s1 Paul prays for those in Ephesus
\p
\v 14 That's why I'm kneeling to \add ask\add* the father¦130046
\v 15 (the one that every father in the heavens¦130057 and¦130058 on earth is named after)
\v 16 that he would cause you to be strengthened inside your minds by the power¦130074 of his spirit¦130078 and from the riches of his greatness.
\v 17 Through \add your\add* faith¦130089, the messiah can live in your hearts¦130092 so that love¦130095 will become your root and¦130097 foundation
\v 18 so that just like the dedicated ones, you¦130100 all will also be strong enough to understand the width and length and height and depth of
\v 19 the messiah's love, and to know¦130119 that having this love exceeds having knowledge so that you all can be filled¦130131 with God's completeness.
\p
\v 20-21 Now we offer praise to \add God\add* in the church and for all the generations to come and to Jesus the messiah—\add God\add* who, through the power¦130151 that works in us, is able to do far more than we can ask for or even understand. May it be so.
\c 4
\s1 Many parts and gifts but one body
\p
\v 1 Because of that, I, a prisoner for the master¦130183, am urging you all to walk¦130186 worthily of the calling to which you were called
\v 2 \x + \xo 4:2: \xt Col 3:12-13.\x*with all humility, gentleness, and¦130194 patience, putting up with one another because of your love¦130202 \add for them\add*,
\v 3 being serious about keeping¦130204 the unity of \add God's\add* spirit¦130208 in the bond of peace¦130213.
\v 4 There is one body¦130215 and one spirit¦130218, just as you all were called to one hope when you were called.
\v 5 There's one master¦130230, one \add system of\add* faith¦130232, one immersion¦130234,
\v 6 one God and father¦130238 of all who is over all and through all and in all.
\p
\v 7 Yet each one of us has been given a measure of grace¦130258 as a gift¦130263 from the messiah,
\v 8 just as it was written,
\q1 “When he ascended to heaven,
\q2 he eliminated captivity
\q2 and gave¦130275 gifts¦130276 to people¦130279.”\x + \xo 4:8: \xt Psa 68:18.\x*
\m
\v 9 Of course, he couldn't ascend if he hadn't first descended down to earth.
\v 10 So the one who descended is the very one who also ascended above all the heavens¦130308 so that he could fill¦130310 all locations.
\v 11 Then he gave¦130315 some as ambassadors¦130319, some as prophets, some as announcers of the good¦130325 message¦130325, some as pastors and teachers¦130330
\v 12 so as to complete the dedicated ones for the work of service¦130338—for building the body¦130342 of the messiah
\v 13 until we¦130346 can reach the unity of our faith¦130353 and¦130354 of our knowledge about God's son—becoming mature people measured against the stature of the fullness of the messiah.
\v 14 Then we'll no longer be \add like\add* children \add in our faith\add*, tossed around by waves and¦130377 being blown by every wind of teaching used to trick us or by crafty people¦130388 who scheme how to deceive us.
\v 15 Instead, by lovingly speaking the truth, we¦130405 will grow up into every aspect of him¦130407—the messiah who is the head 
\v 16 \x + \xo 4:16: \xt Col 2:19.\x*that integrates the entire body together and holds it together by every one of its joints. When each component does its work, the body grows and builds itself up with love.
\s1 Proper behaviour for godly people
\p
\v 17 So I'll say this at the master's direction: you¦130461 all are no longer to walk like \add unbelieving\add* pagans who \add trust\add* in their own futile thinking.
\v 18 Their minds have been darkened because their ignorance has drawn them away from the life¦130481 of God due to the hardening of their hearts.
\v 19 They stopped caring \add about what's right and wrong\add*, and then greedily indulged themselves¦130499 in their own impure lusts.
\p
\v 20 But you¦130510 all didn't learn that about the messiah.
\v 21 If you had heard him and listened to his teaching, you would have heard the truth¦130527 from Jesus¦130530:
\v 22 \x + \xo 4:22: \xt Col 3:9.\x*that you reject the former conduct of the old corrupted you, those seductive desires,
\v 23 and¦130551 allow the spirit¦130554 driving your thoughts to be renewed
\v 24 \x + \xo 4:24: a \xt Col 3:10; \xo b \xt Gen 1:26.\x*and so to remodel yourself as a godly person¦130563 created to obey God and follow the pure truth¦130575.
\p
\v 25 \x + \xo 4:25: \xt Zech 8:16.\x*So steer clear of lies—always speak the truth¦130581 to those around you because we¦130592 are members of each other.
\v 26 \x + \xo 4:26: \xt Psa 4:4 (LXX).\x*Even when you're angry, don't sin, and¦130597 don't carry your anger¦130606 through to the next day—
\v 27 don't let the devil get his foot in.
\v 28 If you've been stealing, then stop it. Instead you should be a hard worker, doing good¦130628 things with your hands¦130626, so that you'll \add earn\add* enough to be able to help those who are in need.
\v 29 Don't let any bad¦130638 talk come out of your mouths, but¦130645 rather words that are helpful to encourage others and to show grace¦130655 to them.
\v 30 And don't sadden God's pure spirit¦130662, because he is the one who recorded your names for the day¦130671 when the price will be paid to buy you all back.
\v 31 So get rid of all bitterness, and rage¦130676 and severe anger¦130678, uproars and slander, and any kind of malice.
\v 32 \x + \xo 4:32: \xt Col 3:13.\x*Instead, be kind to each other, tender-hearted, forgiving¦130697 each other just like God forgave¦130705 you¦130707 all through \add the work of\add* the messiah.
\c 5
\s1 Living in God's light
\p
\v 1 So imitate God like valued children¦130714 \add would imitate their father\add*
\v 2 \x + \xo 5:2: \xt Exo 29:18; Psa 40:6.\x*and immerse yourselves in love¦130719 just as the messiah loves you¦130725 all and allowed himself¦130729 to suffer for us as an offering and sacrifice which is like a pleasant fragrance to God.
\p
\v 3 It's fitting for dedicated \add believers\add* to not even entertain thoughts of sexual immorality or impurity or greed.
\v 4 Nor is dirty or foolish¦130764 talk¦130764 or crude joking fitting, but¦130773 rather thankfulness.
\v 5 You should realise that anyone who is sexually immoral or impure or is a covetous or idolatrous person won't have an inheritance in the kingdom¦130798 of the messiah and¦130801 of God.
\p
\v 6 Don't let anyone seduce you¦130804 with empty talk, because this is exactly what will induce God's strong anger¦130814 on those who're disobedient.
\v 7 So don't get caught up with them
\v 8 because you yourselves were once in the darkness¦130831 but now that you are in the master's light, you should behave like children¦130838 of light.
\v 9 The results of this light¦130845 should be goodness and doing what is right and being honest
\v 10 as you \add aim\add* to please \add our\add* master¦130859.
\v 11 Don't join in with the works of darkness¦130868 which don't lead to positive results, but¦130870 instead you all should expose them
\v 12 because the things¦130873 that unbelievers do in secret are disgraceful to even talk about.
\v 13 But everything will \add eventually\add* have the light shone on it and all these things¦130884 will then be exposed. 
\v 14 That's why it says:
\q1 You who're asleep get up,
\q1 You who're dead¦130908 come back to life,
\q2 The messiah will shine \add his light\add* on you.
\p
\v 15 Because of that, take great care in exactly how you're living. Don't live like fools, but¦130924 like wise people,
\v 16 \x + \xo 5:16: \xt Col 4:5.\x*making good use of your time¦130929, because there's lot of evil¦130933 these days¦130932.
\v 17 So don't be foolish¦130939, but¦130940 rather \add strive to\add* discover what the master¦130950 wants for you.
\p
\v 18 And don't get drunk¦130954 on alchohol because that's excessive. Instead, be filled¦130962 with \add God's\add* spirit¦130965,
\v 19 \x + \xo 5:19-20: \xt Col 3:16-17.\x*sharing scriptures with each other and singing hymns and songs to praise \add our\add* master¦130988,
\v 20 always expressing thanks for everything to \add our\add* father¦131005 God in the authority and name¦130994 of our master¦130996, Jesus the messiah.
\v 21 And show your honour of the messiah by placing yourselves under each other's authority.
\s1 Married couples
\p
\v 22 \x + \xo 5:22: \xt Col 3:18; 1Pe 3:1.\x*Wives should place themselves under their¦131015 own husbands¦131017, just like they're under the master¦131022,
\v 23 because the husband¦131025 is the leader of the wife¦131030 just like the messiah is the head and¦131025 saviour of his body¦131044, the church.
\v 24 Wives should place themselves under their¦131058 husbands¦131060 in everything just like the church should place itself under the messiah.
\p
\v 25 \x + \xo 5:25: \xt Col 3:19; 1Pe 3:7.\x*You husbands must love your¦131066 wives¦131067, just like the messiah loved¦131073 the church and¦131076 gave¦131078 himself¦131077 \add completely\add* for it,
\v 26 so that he could separate the church \add from the world\add* and wash it clean with the water¦131088 of the \add good\add* message¦131090
\v 27 in order to present the splendid church to himself¦131095—without any stains or wrinkles or anything like that—just pure and¦131114 unblemished.
\v 28 So husbands¦131120 should love their wives¦131125 just like their own bodies¦131130—whoever loves his wife¦131135 is loving himself.
\v 29 No one hates their own body, but¦131146 they feed and¦131148 look after it¦131150, just like the messiah does for the church
\v 30 and we¦131160 are parts of his body¦131162.
\v 31 \x + \xo 5:31: \xt Gen 2:24.\x*That's the reason why a man¦131176 leaves his father¦131178 and mother¦131182 and becomes joined with his wife¦131188 and the two¦131194 of them become one unit.
\v 32 This is an amazing mystery but¦131205 I'm talking about the messiah and¦131209 the church.
\v 33 But it applies to you all: each one of you should love your wife like yourself and the wife should respect her husband¦131233.
\c 6
\s1 Parents and children
\p
\v 1 \x + \xo 6:1: \xt Col 3:20.\x*It's right for children¦131235 following the master¦131241 to obey your parents.
\v 2 \x + \xo 6:2-3: \xt Exo 20:12; Deu 5:16.\x*Honour your father¦131248 and¦131250 mother¦131252 (that's the first commandment that's followed by a promise¦131258)
\v 3 so that things will go well for you and you'll have a long life on the earth.
\p
\v 4 \x + \xo 6:4: \xt Col 3:21.\x*Fathers, don't provoke your children¦131275 to anger, but bring them up caringly and teach them disciplines and instructions from the master¦131284.
\s1 Slaves and masters
\p
\v 5 \x + \xo 6:5-8: \xt Col 3:22-25.\x*Slaves, submit to your human masters¦131292 with respect¦131294 and fear, being sincere in your hearts as if \add serving\add* the messiah.
\v 6 Don't just please them when they're watching, but¦131311 \add work\add* as slaves¦131313 of the messiah, genuinely wanting to obey God
\v 7 by serving the master with good will. When you serve as if serving the master and not people¦131331,
\v 8 whether you're a slave¦131352 or free, it's him who will reward you.
\p
\v 9 \x + \xo 6:9: a \xt Col 4:1; \xo b \xt Deu 10:17; Col 3:25.\x*Masters, do the same towards your slaves. You¦131375 know that both the slaves and you¦131373 have the same master in the heavens¦131378, so don't threaten them because our master has no favourites.
\s1 Wear God's armour
\p
\v 10 Concluding then, be enabled by the master¦131397 and¦131398 from the power¦131401 which comes from his strength.
\v 11 Wear God's complete armour because it will enable you¦131413 to stand up against the devil's schemes.
