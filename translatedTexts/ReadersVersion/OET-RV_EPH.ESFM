\mt2 Paul's letter to the 
\mt1 believers in Ephesus
\is1 Introduction
\is2 The author
\ip This \bk Letter to the believers in Ephesus\bk* was written by Paul from prison in Rome.
\is2 This letter
\ip This letter wasn't just written for the assembly of believers there in Ephesus, but also for other assemblies of believers.
\ip Paul's main theme is about God's plan that “at the right time he will gather everything, whether in heaven or here on earth, for the messiah” (1:10).
\ip In the first part of letter, he wrote about unity. Paul carefully explained about how God the father chooses his people, about forgiving and saving them from their sins through his son, Yeshua the messiah.
\ip In the second part of letter, Paul urges the reader that the believers need to be united in the messiah by means of their unity with each other.
\ip Paul uses many allegories about the unity of people with God via the messiah: the believers are the body of the messiah, he is the head; it's like a house, with the messiah as the foundation stone; the believers are also like a bride with the messiah as the groom.
\ip It's also explained here about the correct behaviour of couples, of parents and children, and of slaves and master. Then in concluding his letter, it's explained about the armour that's given to believers for them to use to stand against Satan's attacks.

\v 1 \add This letter is from\add* Paul¦128962, a missionary of Yeshua the messiah by the will of God.\x + \xo 1:1: \xt Acts 18:19-21; 19:1.\x*
\p To the godly people \add there in Ephesus\add* who are faithful¦128978 to Yeshua the messiah.
\p
\v 2 May our father¦128988 God and our master¦128991 Yeshua¦128992 the messiah¦128993 give grace¦128982 and peace¦128985 to you¦128983 all.
\s1 Spiritual blessings
\p
\v 3 We praise God, the father¦128998 of our master¦129000 Yeshua¦129004 the messiah.\f + \fr 1:3 \ft Verses 3-14 seem to be just one long, rambling sentence in the Greek, and it's not totally clear what each part means, or how they all connect logically together in sequence. We have split it into smaller sentence chunks to try to help our readers extract some meaning out of it.\f* He is the one who's blessed us with every¦129010 spiritual¦129012 blessing in heavenly¦129015 places—blessings that come from the messiah.
\v 4 He chose¦129019 us to follow him even before¦129023 the creation of the world¦129025, so that we could become pure and blameless¦129030 in front¦129031 of him. Because of his¦129031 love¦129034
\v 5 he decided in advance to adopt¦129038 us as his¦129050 children through¦129039 Yeshua¦129041 the messiah¦129042. His¦129050 decision gave him great pleasure¦129047
\v 6 and now he's praised¦129052 for the greatness of his¦129054 grace¦129055 which¦129059 favoured¦129060 us, as the one he loved¦129064
\v 7 \x + \xo 1:7: \xt Col 1:14.\x*redeemed us by means of his blood¦129073 and forgave our¦129078 sins. It was from the riches¦129082 of his grace¦129086
\v 8 that was poured onto us that we gain wisdom¦129094 and¦129095 understanding¦129096
\v 9 as he revealed the mystery¦129100 of his will to us according¦129112 to his great pleasure¦129114 as he himself planned.
\v 10 He planned for the orchestration of the times¦129127, and at the right time he will gather everything, whether in heaven¦129139 or here on earth¦129144, for the messiah¦129133
\v 11 and we¦129150 also have been assigned an inheritance¦129150 in him¦129163. This was also predetermined¦129151 according to God's plan and the decisions of his¦129161 will
\v 12 so that we, the ones who first put our¦129172 trust in the messiah¦129177, would praise¦129169 his¦129172 greatness.
\v 13 And you all also, after hearing the message of truth¦129187, the good message about being saved, were confirmed by receiving the spirit¦129200 of pure promise¦129202 after you believed¦129196.
\v 14 This spirit is the deposit¦129208 on our¦129211 inheritance¦129210 until we procure¦129215 the freedom which has been bought for us, leading us to praise¦129217 God's greatness.
\s1 Paul's prayer for them
\p
\v 15 Because¦129221 of that, when I heard¦129224 about your faith¦129228 in the master¦129231 Yeshua and¦129234 your \add acceptance\add* of all the pure believers, 
\v 16 I don't stop giving¦129244 thanks¦129244 for all of you, mentioning¦129247 you in my¦129253 prayers¦129252,
\v 17 asking the God of our¦129259 master¦129258 Yeshua¦129261 the messiah¦129262 to give¦129267 you¦129269 spiritual¦129270 wisdom¦129271 and¦129272 to reveal the knowledge¦129275 about him¦129276.
\v 18 I ask that your¦129293 inner thoughts will be enlightened¦129277 so that you all will know the expectation of what he's calling¦129294 you too—the riches¦129299 of the greatness of his¦129293 inheritance¦129303 for the believers
\v 19 and the exceeding greatness¦129315 of his power to \add help\add* us who believe¦129322, according¦129323 to the working¦129325 of the power of his strength¦129329.
\v 20 \x + \xo 1:20: \xt Psa 110:1.\x*He worked¦129333 this power in the messiah¦129336 when he brought him back to life and seated him in the place of honour in heavenly¦129354 places—
\v 21 giving him authority¦129360 over every law and government and powerful¦129363 groups and organisations, and over every earthly title, not only in the present age but also in the age to come.
\v 22 \x + \xo 1:22: \xt Psa 8:6.\x*Everything in existence will be under¦129384 his¦129387 authority and God set him in charge of all matters concerning¦129392 the assembly¦129395,
\v 23 which¦129396 is his¦129400 body¦129399—the completeness of the messiah who completes everything.
\c 2
\s1 God's mercy, grace, and plans for us
\p
\v 1 \x + \xo 2:1-5: \xt Col 2:13.\x*You all were dead¦129412 due to your¦129422 disobedience and¦129416 the \add path of\add* sinning
\v 2 that you once walked¦129426 along when you followed the trends of this world¦129431 which¦129424 \add in turn\add* come from the ruler¦129435 of the invisible powers—he's the spirit¦129441 that works in the children of disobedience.
\v 3 In the past, we also lived like them inside our¦129465 fleshly lusts and then living out those desires and fantasies, and so we were children¦129477 \add deserving\add* strong anger¦129480 just like everyone else.
\p
\v 4 But God was generous with his¦129496 mercy¦129491 because¦129492 of the great¦129494 love¦129495 that he loved¦129498 us with,
\v 5 so although we were dead¦129504 as a result of our disobedience, he make us alive¦129512 along with the messiah¦129515. Yes, we have been saved¦129518 by \add God's\add* grace¦129516.
\v 6 And God lifted us up and sat¦129522 us together¦129522 with Yeshua the messiah¦129528 in the heavenly¦129525 \add domains\add*
\v 7 so that for the ages to come, he could display¦129531 the overflowing riches¦129541 of his grace¦129544 through his kindess to us via Yeshua¦129553 the messiah¦129552.
\v 8 It's \add God's\add* grace that allows you all to be saved¦129558 through¦129559 faith¦129561. This grace doesn't come from you, but rather it's a gift¦129569 from God—
\v 9 it doesn't originate from your actions so no one can brag about it.
\v 10 We are God's workmanship¦129581 and he's created¦129582 us to do good¦129588 things by following Yeshua¦129585 the messiah¦129584. God has already planned these things for us to do.
\s1 Jews and non-Jews can be united
\p
\v 11 Because of that, don't forget that you¦129603 all were once fleshly unbelievers (nicknamed ‘the uncircumcized¦129610 ones’ by circumsized¦129614 Jews who mark the bodies \add of their males\add* with human hands).
\v 12 At that time¦129622 you were separated from the citizens¦129628 of Israel and were strangers¦129632 to the agreements involving \add God's\add* promise¦129636. You didn't have any future hope as you lived in the world¦129644 without¦129624 \add knowing\add* God.
\p
\v 13 But now \add thanks to\add* Yeshua¦129649 the messiah, you¦129650 all who were once far \add from God\add* have become¦129656 close by means of the messiah's blood¦129660.
\v 14 He is \add the source\add* of peace¦129667 \add between Jews and non-Jews\add*, having broken¦129679 the dividing¦129676 wall that fenced¦129678 them apart and making the two into one. He took the hostility onto himself,
\v 15 \x + \xo 2:15: \xt Col 2:14.\x*having¦129692 declared the \add old \add* commandments¦129689 to be now void so that Jews and non-Jews can now be peaceably¦129706 united.
\v 16 \x + \xo 2:16: \xt Col 1:20.\x*By \add his death\add* on the pole, any hostility is destroyed and¦129708 both groups now become just one body¦129715 in God's sight.
\v 17 \x + \xo 2:17: \xt Isa 57:19.\x*When the messiah came, he announced the good message¦129728: peace to you all who were far \add from God\add*, and peace also to the ones who were near,
\v 18 so now both groups have access¦129747 to the father¦129755 by means of one spirit¦129752 through¦129738 \add the work of\add* the messiah.
\p
\v 19 As a result, you all are no longer¦129758 strangers¦129760 and foreigners, but fellow-citizens¦129765 of the believers and part of God's household¦129769
\v 20 which has been founded¦129775 on the teaching of the ambassadors¦129777 and¦129778 prophets¦129779. The cornerstone¦129781 of this building is Yeshua the messiah¦129785.
\v 21 He joins the entire building¦129791 together¦129792, growing¦129793 us all into a dedicated temple¦129795 for the master¦129798.
\v 22 You all are being¦129803 built¦129803 together¦129803 by following him, becoming a place¦129805 for God's spirit¦129810 to live in.
\c 3
\s1 Paul's assignment to non-Jews
\p
\v 1 That's the reason¦129813 that I, Paul¦129815, am a prisoner¦129817 \add due to my¦129819 serving\add* Yeshua¦129820 the messiah¦129819 for you¦129822 non-Jews.
\v 2 Certainly you have heard¦129827 that God assigned me the task of passing on God's grace¦129831 to you.
\v 3 He revealed his incredible plan as I wrote¦129849 briefly previously¦129849
\v 4 \x + \xo 3:4-6: \xt Col 1:26-27.\x*and¦129857 which¦129854 you¦129855 are all able to read to understand¦129857 my¦129860 insight¦129859 into the incredible plan about the messiah¦129865.
\v 5 This plan wasn't explained to humans in in previous generations¦129869 but has now God's spirit¦129886 has revealed¦129878 it¦129886 to his¦129882 worthy ambassadors¦129881 and¦129883 prophets¦129884.
\v 6 Now non-Jews can have the same inheritance and become members¦129892 of the same body¦129892 and can share in the same promise¦129896 that was the positive message¦129904 of Yeshua¦129901 the messiah¦129900.
\p
\v 7 I have become¦129907 a servant¦129908 of that message as a result of the gift¦129911 of God's grace¦129913 that was given¦129918 to me by means of the working¦129923 of his¦129912 power¦129925.
\v 8 Although I was the least¦129931 of the ones dedicated to this message, I was given¦129935 the grace¦129937 to preach¦129942 this positive message to the non-Jews, to tell them about the endless riches¦129947 of the messiah¦129949
\v 9 and¦129950 to enlighten¦129951 everyone about the assignment of God's incredible plan. God, the one who created¦129970 everything, hid this plan away over the ages
\v 10 so that the wide-ranging wisdom¦129990 of God could be revealed now through¦129985 the church to the rulers¦129978 and¦129979 authorities¦129981 in the heavenly¦129984 realms¦129984.
\v 11 God did this according¦129993 to his¦130006 plan for the ages which¦129997 he established¦129998 in our¦130006 master¦130005, Yeshua¦130003 the messiah¦130002.
\v 12 It's through our faith¦130019 in Yeshua that we¦130009 can have boldness¦130011 and¦130012 confident¦130016 access¦130014 \add to God\add*.
\v 13 Because of that, I'm asking you not to become discouraged over my¦130029 current difficulties as I \add serve\add* you all, in fact you are honoured by them.
\s1 Paul prays for those in Ephesus
\p
\v 14 That's why I'm kneeling to \add ask\add* the father¦130046
\v 15 (the one that every¦130054 father in the heavens¦130057 and¦130058 on earth¦130060 is named¦130061 after)
\v 16 that he would cause you to be strengthened¦130075 inside¦130082 your¦130073 minds by the power¦130074 of his spirit¦130078 and from the riches¦130069 of his greatness.
\v 17 Through \add your\add* faith¦130089, the messiah¦130086 can live in your hearts¦130092 so that love¦130095 will become your root and¦130097 foundation
\v 18 so that just like the dedicated ones, you¦130100 all will also be strong enough to understand the width and length¦130112 and height¦130114 and depth¦130117 of
\v 19 the messiah's¦130128 love, and to know¦130119 that having this love exceeds having knowledge¦130125 so that you all can be filled¦130131 with God's completeness.
\p
\v 20-21 Now we offer praise to \add God\add* in the church and for all the generations to come and to Yeshua the messiah—\add God\add* who, through the power¦130151 that works in us, is able to do far more than we can ask for or even understand¦130148. May it be so.
\c 4
\s1 Many parts and gifts but one body
\p
\v 1 Because of that, I, a prisoner¦130181 for the master¦130183, am urging you all to walk¦130186 worthily¦130185 of the calling¦130188 to which¦130189 you were called¦130190
\v 2 \x + \xo 4:2: \xt Col 3:12-13.\x*with all humility¦130193, gentleness¦130195, and¦130194 patience¦130198, putting up with one another¦130200 because of your love¦130202 \add for them\add*,
\v 3 being¦130203 serious about keeping¦130204 the unity of \add God's\add* spirit¦130208 in the bond of peace¦130213.
\v 4 There is one body¦130215 and one spirit¦130218, just as you all were called to one hope when you were called.
\v 5 There's one master¦130230, one \add system of\add* faith¦130232, one immersion¦130234,
\v 6 one God and father¦130238 of all who is over all and through¦130244 all and in all.
\p
\v 7 Yet each one of us has been given¦130256 a measure¦130261 of grace¦130258 as a gift¦130263 from the messiah¦130265,
\v 8 just as it was written,
\q1 “When he ascended to heaven,
\q2 he eliminated captivity¦130273
\q2 and gave¦130275 gifts¦130276 to people¦130279.”\x + \xo 4:8: \xt Psa 68:18.\x*
\m
\v 9 Of course, he couldn't ascend if he hadn't first descended down to earth¦130297.
\v 10 So the one who descended is the very one who also ascended above¦130305 all the heavens¦130308 so that he could fill¦130310 all locations.
\v 11 Then he gave¦130315 some as ambassadors¦130319, some as prophets¦130322, some as announcers of the good¦130325 message¦130325, some as pastors and teachers¦130330
\v 12 so as to complete¦130333 the dedicated ones for the work of service¦130338—for building¦130340 the body¦130342 of the messiah¦130344
\v 13 until¦130345 we¦130346 can reach the unity of our faith¦130353 and¦130354 of our knowledge¦130356 about God's son—becoming mature¦130363 people measured¦130365 against the stature¦130366 of the fullness¦130368 of the messiah¦130370.
\v 14 Then we'll no longer¦130372 be \add like\add* children \add in our¦130388 faith\add*, tossed¦130376 around by waves¦130376 and¦130377 being blown by every¦130379 wind of teaching¦130383 used to trick¦130386 us or by crafty¦130390 people¦130388 who scheme¦130395 how to deceive us.
\v 15 Instead, by lovingly speaking the truth¦130401, we¦130405 will grow up into every aspect of him¦130407—the messiah¦130417 who is the head 
\v 16 \x + \xo 4:16: \xt Col 2:19.\x*that integrates the entire body together and holds it together by every¦130428 one of its joints¦130429. When each component does its work, the body grows and builds¦130448 itself¦130450 up with love.
\s1 Proper behaviour for godly people
\p
\v 17 So I'll say this at the master's¦130459 direction: you¦130461 all are no longer¦130460 to walk like \add unbelieving\add* pagans¦130467 who \add trust\add* in their¦130473 own futile thinking.
\v 18 Their¦130484 minds have been darkened¦130474 because their ignorance¦130486 has drawn them away from the life¦130481 of God due to the hardening¦130493 of their hearts¦130495.
\v 19 They stopped caring \add about what's right and wrong\add*, and then greedily¦130509 indulged themselves¦130499 in their own impure¦130506 lusts.
\p
\v 20 But you¦130510 all didn't learn¦130514 that about the messiah¦130516.
\v 21 If you had heard him and listened to his teaching, you would have heard the truth¦130527 from Yeshua¦130530:
\v 22 \x + \xo 4:22: \xt Col 3:9.\x*that you reject the former conduct¦130538 of the old corrupted¦130543 you, those seductive¦130548 desires¦130546,
\v 23 and¦130551 allow the spirit¦130554 driving your¦130557 thoughts to be renewed¦130549
\v 24 \x + \xo 4:24: a \xt Col 3:10; \xo b \xt Gen 1:26.\x*and so to remodel yourself as a godly person¦130563 created¦130567 to obey God and follow the pure truth¦130575.
\p
\v 25 \x + \xo 4:25: \xt Zech 8:16.\x*So steer clear of lies—always speak¦130580 the truth¦130581 to those around you because¦130590 we¦130592 are members¦130595 of each other.
\v 26 \x + \xo 4:26: \xt Psa 4:4 (LXX).\x*Even when you're angry, don't sin, and¦130597 don't carry your¦130607 anger¦130606 through to the next day—
\v 27 don't let the devil¦130613 get his foot in.
\v 28 If you've been stealing, then stop it. Instead you should be a hard worker, doing good¦130628 things with your hands¦130626, so that you'll \add earn\add* enough to be able to help those who are in need.
\v 29 Don't let any bad¦130638 talk come out of your¦130642 mouths¦130641, but¦130645 rather words that are helpful to encourage others and to show grace¦130655 to them.
\v 30 And don't sadden God's pure spirit¦130662, because he is the one who recorded your¦130672 names for the day¦130671 when the price will be paid to buy you all back.
\v 31 So get rid of all bitterness¦130674, and rage¦130676 and severe¦130678 anger¦130678, uproars and slander¦130682, and any kind of malice¦130690.
\v 32 \x + \xo 4:32: \xt Col 3:13.\x*Instead, be kind to each other, tender-hearted¦130696, forgiving¦130697 each other just like God forgave¦130705 you¦130707 all through \add the work of\add* the messiah¦130704.
\c 5
\s1 Living in God's light
\p
\v 1 So imitate God like valued children¦130714 \add would imitate their father\add*
\v 2 \x + \xo 5:2: \xt Exo 29:18; Psa 40:6.\x*and immerse yourselves in love¦130719 just as the messiah¦130723 loves you¦130725 all and allowed himself¦130729 to suffer for us as an offering¦130733 and sacrifice¦130737 which is like a pleasant fragrance¦130743 to God.
\p
\v 3 It's fitting for dedicated \add believers\add* to not even entertain thoughts of sexual¦130744 immorality¦130744 or impurity¦130748 or greed¦130751.
\v 4 Nor is dirty or foolish¦130764 talk¦130764 or crude¦130767 joking¦130767 fitting¦130772, but¦130773 rather¦130774 thankfulness¦130775.
\v 5 You should realise that anyone who is sexually¦130783 immoral¦130783 or impure or is a covetous¦130787 or idolatrous¦130791 person won't have an inheritance¦130794 in the kingdom¦130798 of the messiah¦130800 and¦130801 of God.
\p
\v 6 Don't let anyone seduce¦130805 you¦130804 with empty¦130807 talk, because¦130809 this is exactly what will induce God's strong anger¦130814 on those who're disobedient.
\v 7 So don't get caught up with them
\v 8 because you yourselves were once in the darkness¦130831 but now that you are in the master's¦130836 light, you should behave like children¦130838 of light.
\v 9 The results of this light¦130845 should be goodness¦130849 and doing what is right¦130851 and being honest
\v 10 as you \add aim\add* to please¦130857 \add our\add* master¦130859.
\v 11 Don't join in with the works¦130864 of darkness¦130868 which don't lead to positive results, but¦130870 instead you all should expose them
\v 12 because the things¦130873 that unbelievers do in secret¦130876 are disgraceful to even talk about.
\v 13 But everything¦130892 will \add eventually\add* have the light shone on it and all these things¦130884 will then be exposed. 
\v 14 That's why it says:
\q1 You who're asleep get up,
\q1 You who're dead¦130908 come back to life,
\q2 The messiah¦130913 will shine \add his light\add* on you.
\p
\v 15 Because of that, take great care in exactly¦130918 how you're living. Don't live like fools, but¦130924 like wise people,
\v 16 \x + \xo 5:16: \xt Col 4:5.\x*making good use of your time¦130929, because¦130930 there's lot of evil¦130933 these days¦130932.
\v 17 So don't be foolish¦130939, but¦130940 rather \add strive to\add* discover what the master¦130950 wants for you.
\p
\v 18 And don't get drunk¦130954 on alchohol because that's excessive. Instead, be filled¦130962 with \add God's\add* spirit¦130965,
\v 19 \x + \xo 5:19-20: \xt Col 3:16-17.\x*sharing scriptures with each other and singing hymns¦130971 and songs¦130973 to praise¦130980 \add our\add* master¦130988,
\v 20 always¦130990 expressing thanks¦130989 for everything to \add our\add* father¦131005 God in the authority and name¦130994 of our master¦130996, Yeshua the messiah¦131000.
\v 21 And show your honour of the messiah¦131011 by placing yourselves under each other's authority.

\v 23 because¦131023 the husband¦131025 is the leader of the wife¦131030 just like the messiah¦131034 is the head and¦131025 saviour¦131042 of his¦131036 body¦131044, the church.
\v 24 Wives should place themselves under their¦131058 husbands¦131060 in everything¦131062 just like the church should place itself under the messiah¦131053.
\p
\v 25 \x + \xo 5:25: \xt Col 3:19; 1Pe 3:7.\x*You husbands must love your¦131066 wives¦131067, just like the messiah¦131072 loved¦131073 the church and¦131076 gave¦131078 himself¦131077 \add completely\add* for it,
\v 26 so that he could separate the church \add from the world\add* and wash it clean¦131084 with the water¦131088 of the \add good\add* message¦131090
\v 27 in order to present¦131092 the splendid church to himself¦131095—without any stains¦131103 or wrinkles¦131105 or anything¦131107 like that—just pure and¦131114 unblemished.
\v 28 So husbands¦131120 should love their wives¦131125 just like their own bodies¦131130—whoever loves his¦131128 wife¦131135 is loving himself.
\v 29 No one hates their own body, but¦131146 they feed and¦131148 look after it¦131150, just like the messiah¦131154 does for the church
\v 30 and we¦131160 are parts of his¦131163 body¦131162.
\v 31 \x + \xo 5:31: \xt Gen 2:24.\x*That's the reason why a man¦131176 leaves his father¦131178 and mother¦131182 and becomes joined¦131184 with his wife¦131188 and the two¦131194 of them become one unit.
\v 32 This is an amazing mystery¦131200 but¦131205 I'm talking about the messiah¦131208 and¦131209 the church.
\v 33 But it applies to you all: each one of you should love your wife like yourself and the wife should respect her husband¦131233.

\v 6 Don't just please¦131310 them when they're watching, but¦131311 \add work\add* as slaves¦131313 of the messiah¦131315, genuinely wanting to obey God
\v 7 by serving the master with good will. When you serve as if serving the master and not people¦131331,
\v 8 whether¦131351 you're a slave¦131352 or free, it's him who will reward you.
\p

\s1 Wear God's armour

\v 10 Concluding then, be enabled¦131393 by the master¦131397 and¦131398 from the power¦131401 which comes from his¦131404 strength¦131403.
\v 11 Wear God's complete armour because it will enable you¦131413 to stand¦131414 up against¦131415 the devil's¦131419 schemes¦131417.
\v 12 Our¦131451 struggle isn't against people, but¦131431 against rulers, authorities¦131438, the powers of this world's¦131441 darkness¦131443, and¦131429 the spiritual¦131449 forces of wickedness¦131451 in heavenly¦131454 places.
\v 13 Because¦131455 of that, make use of every piece of God's armour so that you'll be able to resist¦131465 those powers in the evil¦131470 day¦131468 and having¦131473 done everything, to remain standing¦131475.
