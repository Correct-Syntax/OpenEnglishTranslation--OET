\mt2 of Yeshua the messiah
\is1 Introduction
\ip \bk Yohan's (John's) revelation of Yeshua (Jesus) the messiah\bk* concerns events that will happen in the future. This was written long ago in a time when the believers were persecuted due to their faith in the master Yeshua, the messiah, and Yohan himself had forcibly exiled to Patmos Island by the Roman authorities and held there. Yohan's main purpose for writing this was to give hope to the believers and to encourage them to persevere in their faith despite their persecution.
\ip A major portion of what's written in this document is the revelation of Yeshua the messiah to Yohan of incredible signs and all those symbols have a meaning and interpretation. At the time of writing, some were likely understood by the Christians of the time, but now, some of the symbols are very hard to interpret, and there's been a large variety of interpretations from different people. But even though it's like that, due also signs easy just understand like sungey iyan igpasabut the power and authority, and the kampilan iyan igpasabut the samuk. Inlibed-libed of many and of various paahi the themes of this document by means of signs. But easy just understand the very important it's written here: destruction indeed of God the all enemy din by means of ki the messiah Yeshua, and egdasahan din also the his people migpabulus migpamakey, and egpakalemung them kandin of without ending. And/Now due egpakapahale our there in the final chapter: this concerns the new sky and planet that God will create and concerning the new Yerusalem that will descend from the sky.

\s1 Yohan sees the messiah
\rem /s1 Vision of the Son of Man; A Vision of Christ; One like a Son of Man
\p
\v 9 I, John, am your¦156560 brother¦156559 and partner in the suffering \add that's typical of those who follow\add* Yeshua. \add I've been exiled to\add* Patmos¦156587 Island where I endure¦156572 because¦156588 I believe God's message¦156591 and \nd Yeshua's¦156598\nd* testimony¦156597 and \add look forward to\add* his kingdom¦156570.
\v 10 One Sunday \add while meditating\add*, \add God's\add* \nd spirit¦156603\nd* gave me a vision, and¦156608 I heard¦156609 a voice¦156613 behind¦156611 me that seemed as loud¦156614 as a trumpet¦156618 blast
\v 11 that said, “Write down what you¦156635 see \add here\add* on a scroll¦156640 and send¦156642 it to the seven¦156644 assemblies¦156645 \add of believers\add*—to \add the cities of\add* Ephesus¦156650, Smyrna¦156653, Pergamum¦156657, Thyatira¦156660, Sardis¦156665, Philadelphia¦156668, and to Laodicea¦156671.”
\p
\v 12 Then I turned to see who was talking¦156679 to me, and I saw¦156686 seven¦156687 golden¦156689 lamp holders,
\v 13 and standing among them was a man who looked like humanity's child,\f + \fr 1:13 \ft It's not certain what was meant here: either ‘a man who looked like humanity's child’ or ‘a form that looked like a human man’.\f* wearing a long robe with a golden¦156712 sash around His¦156701 chest.\x + \xo 1:13: a \xt Dan 7:13; \xo b \xt Dan 10:5.\x*
\v 14 His¦156718 hair¦156721 was gleaming white like wool or snow and his¦156718 eyes¦156731 were \add bright\add* like a fiery flame¦156734.\x + \xo 1:14: \xt Dan 7:9.\x*
\v 15 His¦156739 feet¦156738 shone like bronze¦156741 that had been refined¦156745 in a furnace¦156744, and his¦156739 voice was like the sound of a \add river of rushing\add* water¦156754.\x + \xo 1:15: \xt Eze 1:24; 43:2.\x*
\v 16 He was holding¦156757 seven¦156766 stars¦156765 in his right¦156761 hand¦156763 and a sharp¦156774 sword¦156772 was extending from his mouth¦156770, and his face¦156778 was like the sun¦156783 shining¦156784 at its brightest.
\v 17 And when I saw¦156791 him, I quickly lay at his feet¦156797, \add breathless\add* like a dead¦156801 man, but he placed his right¦156806 hand¦156806 on me, and told me, “Don't be afraid. \em I am\em* the first¦156819 and the last.\x + \xo 1:17: \xt Isa 44:6; 48:12; Rev 2:8; 22:13.\x*

\v 2 “I know about your activities and work, and your endurance¦156950 and that you can not tolerate evil¦156957 people, and that you have investigated the ones calling themselves¦156964 missionaries but are not, and you have found¦156972 them to be frauds.
\v 3 \add I'm aware that\add* you've endured¦156978 and even suffered \add persecution\add* because¦156985 you've \add believed in\add* me, but you've never given up.
\v 4 However, I do have something against¦156997 you: you've abandoned the love¦157001 that you first¦157004 had.
\v 5 So¦157010 \add now, you need to\add* remember¦157009 where¦157011 you've fallen¦157012 from, and repent and repeat how you behaved at the beginning, but if you don't, I'll come to you and if you don't repent, I'll remove¦157030 your¦157033 lampstand¦157032 from its place¦157036.
\v 6 But you do have this going for you: you hate what the \add disciples of\add* Nicolaus are doing,\f + \fr 2:7 \ft Nicolaus' disciples ate food that had been sacrificed to idols and committed sexual sins.\f* just like I do.

\v 10 Don't be afraid about what you're¦157149 going to suffer¦157151.

\v 14 But I do have a few things against¦157272 you: you have some people there¦157278 who hold to \add the ancient prophet\add* Balaam's teaching.\x + \xo 2:14: a \xt Num 22:5,7; 31:16; Deu 23:4; \xo b \xt Num 25:1-3.\x* He taught¦157281 \add Moab's king\add*, Balak¦157289, how to tempt¦157293 the Israelis and to eat \add food\add* that had been sacrificed¦157300 to idols, and to be sexually¦157302 immoral¦157302.

\p The truth, the faithful¦158052 and¦158053 true witness¦158050, the originator of God's creation¦158061, says:
\v 15 “I'm aware of what you've been doing \add and\add* that you're¦158071 neither¦158069 hot nor cold. (You'd benefit\f + \fr 3:15 \ft TC: Some manuscripts don't have this parenthesised sentence at all, and some later manuscripts have ‘I wish’ instead of ‘You'd benefit’.\f* if you were hot or cold.)
\v 16 So because¦158082 you're¦158085 lukewarm¦158084, neither¦158087 hot nor cold¦158092, I'll spit you out of my¦158103 mouth¦158101.

\v 18 I advise you to buy gold¦158140 from me that's been refined¦158141 by fire¦158143 so that you might get rich, and buy white¦158148 clothes¦158147 so that you can dress yourself¦158150 so that the shame¦158155 of your nakedness¦158157 might not be displayed, and buy ointment to rub on your eyes¦158167 so that you'll be able to see.

\v 1 After¦158249 that, I looked¦158251 and wow, a door¦158254 opening in heaven¦158259, and the first¦158265 voice¦158263 that I'd heard¦158267 that sounded like a trumpet¦158269 told me, “Come up here and I'll show you what must happen after¦158286 those things.”
\v 2 Immediately¦158289 I was in the \nd spirit¦158292\nd* and wow, a throne was appearing in heaven¦158299 with someone sitting¦158307 on it.\x + \xo 4:2-3: \xt Eze 1:26-28; 10:1.\x*

\v 5 From the \add centre\add* throne came lightning¦158374 flashes and thunderous¦158379 sounds and voices¦158377.

\v 3 But there wasn't any person on earth or \add in the place of the dead\add* who was permitted to open the scroll¦158668 and¦158657 read it¦158672.
\v 4 I began to cry loudly, because¦158678 no one could be found¦158682 who was worthy¦158680 to open the scroll¦158687 or look inside it¦158690.
\v 5 Then one of the elders¦158695 said to me, “Stop crying. Look¦158700, here's the lion¦158703 from the tribe¦158708 of Judah¦158709.

\v 8 When he'd taken the scroll¦158790, the four living¦158793 creatures¦158793 and the twenty-four¦158796 elders knelt down in from of the lamb.

\v 10 These souls called out loudly¦159313, “You, master¦159318, always do what is right and decide what is right! So please condemn and punish the people on the earth¦159338 who killed us.”

\v 8 Then the second¦160200 messenger¦160201 blew his trumpet¦160202, and something¦160203 was thrown¦160209 into the ocean that was like a huge, burning mountains¦160205, and a third¦160217 of the sea turned into blood¦160220.
\v 9 One third of the living creatures¦160228 in the sea¦160232 died¦160222, and a third of the ships¦160241 were destroyed.
\p
\v 10 Then the third messenger¦160247 blew his trumpet¦160248 and a huge star¦160254, burning like a torch¦160258, fell \add down\add* from the sky¦160253 and landed on a third of the rivers¦160265 and on the springs¦160269 of water¦160271.\x + \xo 8:10: \xt Isa 14:12.\x*
\v 11 That star¦160276 is named ‘Bitterness’ and a third¦160287 of those waters turned bitter¦160303. Many people¦160296 died from the waters, because¦160302 they \add became¦160284 poisonous\add*.\x + \xo 8:11: \xt Jer 9:15.\x*
\p
\v 12 Then the fourth¦160306 messenger¦160307 blew his trumpet¦160308 and a third of the sun and the moon were struck and the sun didn't shine for a third of the day¦160332, nor the moon for a third of the night¦160347. One third of the stars¦160324 were struck and went dark.\x + \xo 8:12: \xt Isa 13:10; Eze 32:7; Yoel 2:10,31; 3:15.\x*
\p
\v 13 Then as I watched, I heard¦160352 an eagle¦160354 that was flying¦160356 high in the sky, shouting loudly¦160361, “Three terrible things will happen to the people who're living¦160368 on the earth¦160371 when the three¦160379 remaining messengers¦160380 blow their trumpets¦160377.”
\c 9
\s1 The fifth trumpet brings the first terror
\p
\v 1 Then the fifth¦160386 messenger blew his trumpet¦160388 and I saw¦160390 a star that had fallen¦160396 from the sky¦160395 to the earth¦160400, and he/it\f + \fr 9:1 \ft It's ambiguous in the Greek whether the key was given to the messenger or the star, or possibly the falling star was the messenger.\f* was given the key to the deep, dark pit.
\v 2 When he/it \add unlocked and\add* opened¦160411 that pit, smoke came up out of it like the smoke of a large furnace¦160426, and the smoke darkened¦160431 the sun¦160433 and the air.\x + \xo 9:2: \xt Gen 19:8.\x*
\v 3 Then locusts¦160447 came out of the smoke¦160445 and \add descended\add* on the land, and they were given¦160452 \add stinging\add* power like the large scorpions¦160460 of the earth.\x + \xo 9:3: \xt Exo 10:12-15.\x*
\v 4 \add However the locusts\add* were told that they¦160469 shouldn't harm the grass¦160472 or any green¦160478 plants or trees, but only those people¦160485 who didn't have God's mark on their¦160496 foreheads¦160497.\x + \xo 9:4: \xt Eze 9:4.\x*
\v 5 They weren't given¦160500 power to kill¦160505 them, but only to torment them for five¦160512 months¦160511, and their¦160516 torment was like that of a scorpion¦160519 when it strikes¦160522 a person¦160523.
\v 6 People in those¦160528 days¦160527 will try to die, but won't be able to—they will long to die, but death will run away from them.\x + \xo 9:6: \xt Yob 3:21; Jer 8:3.\x*
\p
\v 7 The locusts¦160560 looked like horses¦160564 that had been prepared¦160565 for battle, with something¦160568 on their heads¦160571 that were similar to golden crowns¦160574 and their faces being like human¦160584 faces.\x + \xo 9:7: \xt Yoel 2:4.\x*
\v 8 Their¦160595 hair was like women's¦160591 hair and their¦160595 teeth were like lions' teeth.\x + \xo 9:8: \xt Yoel 1:6.\x*
\v 9 They wore chestplates that seemed to be made of iron, and the sound of their¦160611 wings¦160610 was like the roar of many horses¦160615 rushing into battle pulling chariots¦160614.\x + \xo 9:9: \xt Yoel 2:5.\x*
\v 10 They had tails with stingers¦160627 like scorpions¦160625 which had the power¦160636 to harm people¦160643 for five¦160645 months¦160644.
\v 11 They had a king¦160654 in charge of them who's the messenger¦160657 of the deep pit—his name is ‘Destroyer’. (‘Abaddon¦160666’ in Hebrew and ‘Apollyon¦160677’ in Greek.)
\p
\v 12 The first terrible event has now passed, but there are still¦160686 two¦160688 more to follow.
\s1 The sixth trumpet brings the second terror
\p
\v 13 Then the sixth¦160695 messenger¦160696 blew his trumpet¦160697 and¦160698 I heard¦160699 a voice¦160700 coming from the corners of the golden¦160709 altar¦160707 in front of \nd God¦160713\nd*,\x + \xo 9:13: \xt Exo 30:1-3.\x*
\v 14 that was telling the sixth¦160717 messenger (with the trumpet¦160724), “Release¦160726 the four¦160728 messengers that are tied up by the large Euphrates River.”
\v 15 So the four¦160747 messengers¦160748 who had been prepared¦160750 for this exact time were released to kill¦160764 a third¦160766 of humankind.
\v 16 I heard¦160784 someone say how many mounted soldiers there were—there were 200 million of them,
\v 17 and this is what the horses and their riders looked like in my vision¦160795: the soldiers \add wore\add* chestplates that were \add red like\add* fire, \add blue like\add* sapphire, and \add yellow like\add* sulfur. The heads of the horses were like lions' heads, and fire, smoke¦160826, and fumes of burning sulfur came out of their mouths¦160821.
\v 18 These three¦160832 plagues¦160833 (fire¦160844, smoke¦160848, and burning sulfur¦160852 coming out of their¦160858 mouths¦160857) killed¦160835 one third¦160838 of humankind
\v 19 because the horses' power¦160864 is in their mouths¦160874 and in their tails, because their tails are like snakes, having¦160891 heads¦160894 that injure¦160898 \add people\add*.
\p
\v 20 \add However,\add* the rest of humankind that hadn't been killed¦160906 by those plagues¦160909, didn't repent¦160915 of their¦160921 actions and didn't stop worshipping demons¦160927 and idols \add made\add* of gold and silver¦160936 and bronze¦160940 and stone¦160945 and wood—idols that can't see, can't hear¦160956, and can't walk¦160958.\x + \xo 9:20: \xt Psa 115:4-7; 135:15-17; Dan 5:23.\x*
\v 21 They \add also\add* didn't repent¦160961 of their murdering¦160965 or of their sorcery¦160970, nor of their sexual immorality or of their stealing.

\s1 The messenger and the small scroll
\rem /s1 The Angel with the Little Scroll; The Angel and the Small Scroll
\p
\v 1 Then \add in the vision\add* I saw¦160985 another¦160986 powerful messenger¦160987 coming¦160989 down from the sky wrapped in a cloud¦160994 and with a rainbow¦160998 above his head. His¦161004 face¦161008 was like the sun¦161012 and his feet¦161015 were like pillars¦161018 of fire¦161020,
\v 2 and he was holding a small¦161029 opened¦161031 scroll¦161029. He set his right¦161039 foot \add down\add* on the ocean and his left \add foot down\add* on the land
\v 3 and shouted in a loud¦161056 voice like a lion¦161058 roaring¦161059, and when he shouted, the seven¦161066 thunders¦161068 spoke¦161064 out in their own voices.
\v 4 When the seven thunders spoke, I was going¦161086 to write \add down what they said\add* but I heard¦161091 a voice¦161092 from the sky that said, “Keep what the seven thunders have said secret, and don't¦161108 write it down.”
\p
\v 5 Then the messenger¦161114 that I'd seen standing across the ocean and the land raised his¦161129 right¦161131 hand¦161127\x + \xo 10:5-7: \xt Exo 20:11; Deu 32:40; Dan 12:7; Amos 3:7.\x*
\v 6 and made an oath by the one living¦161139 through all the ages and who created¦161146 heaven¦161148 and everything in it and the earth¦161155 and everything in it, and the sea¦161162 and everything in it, saying, “There won't be any more delay,
\v 7 but¦161174 at the time when the seventh¦161181 messenger¦161182 will speak and blow his trumpet¦161188, then the hidden purposes of \nd God¦161195\nd* will come to be, just like he told his slaves¦161201 the prophets¦161207 \add long ago\add*.”
