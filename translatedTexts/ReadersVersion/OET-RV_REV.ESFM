\mt1 Revelation
\mt2 of Yeshua the messiah
\is1 Introduction
\ip \bk Yohan's (John's) revelation of Yeshua (Jesus) the messiah\bk* concerns events that will happen in the future. This was written long ago in a time when the believers were persecuted due to their faith in the master Yeshua, the messiah, and Yohan himself had been forcibly exiled to Patmos Island by the Roman authorities and held there. Yohan's main purpose for writing this was to give hope to the believers and to encourage them to persevere in their faith despite their persecution.
\ip A major portion of what's written in this document is the revelation by Yeshua the messiah to Yohan of incredible signs and all those symbols have a meaning and interpretation. At the time of writing, some were likely understood by the Christians of the time, but now, some of the symbols are very hard to interpret, and there's been a large range of interpretations from different people. But even though it's like that, there are also some signs that are easier to understand like ‘horns’ which denote power and authority, and ‘sword’ which denotes war. The themes are repeated throughout this document in various different forms. But it's important to just understand the main points of what's written here: God will indeed destroy all of his enemies through the messiah Yeshua, and also, he will reward all his people who persevere in serving him, and then he'll bring them to live with him. The final major them concerns the new sky and earth that God will create, and concerning the new Yerusalem that will descend from heaven.

\rem /s1 Vision of the Son of Man; A Vision of Christ; One like a Son of Man
\p
\v 9 I, John, am your¦156572 brother¦156571 and partner in the suffering \add that's typical of those who follow\add* Yeshua. \add I've been exiled to\add* Patmos¦156599 Island where I endure¦156584 because¦156600 I believe God's message¦156603 and \nd Yeshua's¦156610\nd* testimony¦156609 and \add look forward to\add* his kingdom¦156582.
\v 10 One Sunday \add while meditating\add*, \add God's\add* \nd spirit¦156615\nd* gave me a vision, and¦156620 I heard¦156621 a voice¦156625 behind¦156623 me that seemed as loud¦156626 as a trumpet¦156630 blast
\v 11 that said, “Write down what you¦156647 see \add here\add* on a scroll¦156652 and send¦156654 it to the seven¦156656 assemblies¦156657 \add of believers\add*—to \add the cities of\add* Ephesus¦156662, Smyrna¦156665, Pergamum¦156669, Thyatira¦156672, Sardis¦156677, Philadelphia¦156680, and to Laodicea¦156683.”
\p
\v 12 Then¦156686 I turned to see who was talking¦156691 to me, and I saw¦156698 seven¦156699 golden¦156701 lamp holders,
\v 13 and standing among them was a man who looked like humanity's child,\f + \fr 1:13 \ft It's not certain what was meant here: either ‘a man who looked like humanity's child’ or ‘a form that looked like a human man’.\f* wearing a long robe with a golden¦156724 sash around His¦156713 chest.\x + \xo 1:13: a \xt Dan 7:13; \xo b \xt Dan 10:5.\x*
\v 14 His¦156730 hair¦156733 was gleaming white like wool or snow and his¦156730 eyes¦156743 were \add bright\add* like a fiery flame¦156746.\x + \xo 1:14: \xt Dan 7:9.\x*
\v 15 His¦156751 feet¦156750 shone like bronze¦156753 that had been refined¦156757 in a furnace¦156756, and his¦156751 voice was like the sound of a \add river of rushing\add* water¦156766.\x + \xo 1:15: \xt Eze 1:24; 43:2.\x*
\v 16 He was holding¦156769 seven¦156778 stars¦156777 in his right¦156773 hand¦156775 and a sharp¦156786 sword¦156784 was extending from his mouth¦156782, and his face¦156790 was like the sun¦156795 shining¦156796 at its¦156800 brightest.
\v 17 And when I saw¦156803 him, I quickly lay at his feet¦156809, \add breathless\add* like a dead¦156813 man, but he placed his right¦156818 hand¦156818 on me, and told me, “Don't be afraid. \em I am\em* the first¦156831 and the last.\x + \xo 1:17: \xt Isa 44:6; 48:12; Rev 2:8; 22:13.\x*

\v 3 \add I'm aware that\add* you've endured¦156990 and even suffered \add persecution\add* because¦156997 you've \add believed in\add* me, but you've never given up.
\v 4 However, I do have something against¦157009 you: you've abandoned the love¦157013 that you first¦157016 had.
\v 5 So¦157022 \add now, you need to\add* remember¦157021 where¦157023 you've fallen¦157024 from, and repent and repeat how you behaved at the beginning, but if you don't, I'll come to you and if you don't repent, I'll remove¦157042 your¦157045 lampstand¦157044 from its¦157049 place¦157048.
\v 6 But you do have this going for you: you hate what the \add disciples of\add* Nicolaus are doing,\f + \fr 2:7 \ft Nicolaus' disciples ate food that had been sacrificed to idols and committed sexual sins.\f* just like I do.

\v 10 Don't be afraid about what you're¦157161 going to suffer¦157163.

\v 14 But I do have a few things against¦157284 you: you have some people there¦157290 who hold to \add the ancient prophet\add* Balaam's teaching.\x + \xo 2:14: a \xt Num 22:5,7; 31:16; Deu 23:4; \xo b \xt Num 25:1-3.\x* He taught¦157293 \add Moab's king\add*, Balak¦157301, how to tempt¦157305 the Israelis and to eat \add food\add* that had been sacrificed¦157312 to idols, and to be sexually¦157314 immoral¦157314.

\p The truth, the faithful¦158064 and¦158065 true witness¦158062, the originator of God's creation¦158073, says:
\v 15 “I'm aware of what you've been doing \add and\add* that you're¦158083 neither¦158081 hot nor cold. (You'd benefit\f + \fr 3:15 \ft TC: Some manuscripts don't have this parenthesised sentence at all, and some later manuscripts have ‘I wish’ instead of ‘You'd benefit’.\f* if you were hot or cold.)
\v 16 So because¦158094 you're¦158097 lukewarm¦158096, neither¦158099 hot nor cold¦158104, I'll spit you out of my¦158115 mouth¦158113.

\v 18 I advise you to buy gold¦158152 from me that's been refined¦158153 by fire¦158155 so that you might get rich, and buy white¦158160 clothes¦158159 so that you can dress yourself¦158162 so that the shame¦158167 of your nakedness¦158169 might not be displayed, and buy ointment to rub on your eyes¦158179 so that you'll be able to see.

\v 1 After¦158261 that, I looked¦158263 and wow, a door¦158266 opening in heaven¦158271, and the first¦158277 voice¦158275 that I'd heard¦158279 that sounded like a trumpet¦158281 told me, “Come up here and I'll show you what must happen after¦158298 those things.”
\v 2 Immediately¦158301 I was in the \nd spirit¦158304\nd* and wow, a throne was appearing in heaven¦158311 with someone sitting¦158319 on it.\x + \xo 4:2-3: \xt Eze 1:26-28; 10:1.\x*

\v 4 Surrounding that throne were twenty-four other thrones, and on them sat twenty-four elders¦158366 dressed in white¦158371 and with golden¦158379 crowns¦158378 on their¦158377 heads¦158376.
\v 5 From the \add centre\add* throne came lightning¦158386 flashes and thunderous¦158391 sounds and voices¦158389.

\v 1 Then¦158620 I saw¦158619 a scroll¦158629 in the right-hand¦158623 of the one sitting¦158625 on the throne¦158628. It had writing on both sides, and have been sealed¦158636 with seven¦158638 \add wax\add* seals¦158637.\x + \xo 5:1: \xt Eze 2:9-10; Isa 29:11.\x*

\v 4 I began to cry loudly, because¦158690 no one could be found¦158694 who was worthy¦158692 to open the scroll¦158699 or look inside it¦158702.
\v 5 Then¦158705 one of the elders¦158707 said to me, “Stop crying. Look¦158712, here's the lion¦158715 from the tribe¦158720 of Judah¦158721.

The lamb looked like it had been slaughtered, and it had seven horns¦158761 and seven eyes¦158764 which¦158766 are God's seven spirits¦158771 that had been sent¦158778 throughout the world.\x + \xo 5:6: a \xt Isa 53:7; \xo b \xt Zech 4:10.\x*
\v 7 The lamb went¦158784 up to the throne and accepted \add the scroll\add* from the right¦158791 hand¦158791 of the one sitting¦158794 on the throne.
\v 8 When he'd taken the scroll¦158802, the four living¦158805 creatures¦158805 and the twenty-four¦158808 elders knelt down in from of the lamb.

\p
\v 11 Then¦158891 I looked¦158890 and I heard¦158892 the voices¦158894 of the living¦158903 creatures¦158903 and elders¦158906 that were around¦158898 the throne¦158900 along with millions of \add God's\add* messengers¦158895\x + \xo 5:11: \xt Dan 7:10.\x*

\p
\v 14 Then¦159013 the four¦159013 living¦159014 creatures¦159014 said, “May¦159018 it¦159018 be¦159018 so¦159018,” and the elders¦159023 knelt down and worshipped.

\v 1 Then¦159036 I saw¦159035 the lamb breaking the first of the seven¦159044 seals¦159045, and¦159046 I heard¦159047 one of the four¦159051 living¦159052 creatures¦159052 say, “Come,” in a thunderous¦159059 voice¦159056.
\v 2 So¦159067 I looked¦159066, and wow, there was a white¦159070 horse¦159069 with someone sitting¦159073 on it holding a bow \add and arrow\add*. A crown¦159083 was given¦159081 to him, and then he went¦159085 out as a conqueror to conquer.\x + \xo 6:2: \xt Zech 1:8; 6:3,6.\x*

\v 6 Then¦159183 I heard¦159182 \add something¦159182\add* like a voice¦159184 from among the four¦159188 living¦159189 creatures¦159189 that said, “A kilo of wheat¦159192 for a day's pay, or three¦159195 kilos of barley¦159198 for the same price.

\v 8 Then¦159234 I looked¦159233, and wow, there was a green¦159237 horse¦159236. The one sitting on it was named ‘Death¦159247’, and Hades was \add sitting\add* behind him.

\v 9 When \add the lamb\add* broke the fifth¦159288 seal, under the altar¦159296 I saw¦159292 the souls¦159298 of everyone who had been killed because of God's word and¦159308 because of the testimony¦159311 that they¦159319 had upheld.
\v 10 These souls called out loudly¦159325, “You, master¦159330, always do what is right and decide what is right! So¦159323 please condemn and punish the people on the earth¦159350 who killed us.”
\v 11 Then¦159353 each of them was given¦159352 a white¦159359 robe¦159357, and told to wait a little¦159371 longer until¦159372 the full number was reached of their¦159381 fellow¦159380 servants and brothers¦159384 and sisters¦159384 who would also be killed¦159389 like they were.

\v 6 Then¦160162 the seven messengers¦160163 who had the seven trumpets¦160168, got ready to blow them.
\p
\v 7 Then¦160176 the first¦160176 messenger blew his trumpet¦160178 and then hail and fire¦160183 mixed¦160184 together with blood¦160187 was thrown¦160189 \add down\add* on the earth and third of the earth was burnt up along with a third of the trees¦160203, and all the green¦160208 grass¦160207 got burnt up.\x + \xo 8:7: \xt Exo 9:23-25; Eze 38:22.\x*
\p
\v 8 Then¦160212 the second¦160212 messenger¦160213 blew his trumpet¦160214, and something¦160215 was thrown¦160221 into the ocean that was like a huge, burning mountains¦160217, and a third¦160229 of the sea turned into blood¦160232.
\v 9 One third of the living creatures¦160240 in the sea¦160244 died¦160234, and a third of the ships¦160253 were destroyed.
\p
\v 10 Then¦160258 the third messenger¦160259 blew his trumpet¦160260 and a huge star¦160266, burning like a torch¦160270, fell \add down\add* from the sky¦160265 and landed on a third of the rivers¦160277 and on the springs¦160281 of water¦160283.\x + \xo 8:10: \xt Isa 14:12.\x*
\v 11 That star¦160288 is named ‘Bitterness’ and a third¦160299 of those waters turned bitter¦160315. Many people¦160308 died from the waters, because¦160314 they \add became¦160296 poisonous\add*.\x + \xo 8:11: \xt Jer 9:15.\x*
\p
\v 12 Then¦160318 the fourth¦160318 messenger¦160319 blew his trumpet¦160320 and a third of the sun and the moon were struck and the sun didn't shine for a third of the day¦160344, nor the moon for a third of the night¦160359. One third of the stars¦160336 were struck and went dark.\x + \xo 8:12: \xt Isa 13:10; Eze 32:7; Yoel 2:10,31; 3:15.\x*
\p
\v 13 Then¦160363 as I watched, I heard¦160364 an eagle¦160366 that was flying¦160368 high in the sky, shouting loudly¦160373, “Three terrible things will happen to the people who're living¦160380 on the earth¦160383 when the three¦160391 remaining messengers¦160392 blow their trumpets¦160389.”
\c 9
\s1 The fifth trumpet brings the first terror
\p
\v 1 Then¦160398 the fifth¦160398 messenger blew his trumpet¦160400 and I saw¦160402 a star that had fallen¦160408 from the sky¦160407 to the earth¦160412, and he/it\f + \fr 9:1 \ft It's ambiguous in the Greek whether the key was given to the messenger or the star, or possibly the falling star was the messenger.\f* was given the key to the deep, dark pit.
\v 2 When he/it \add unlocked and\add* opened¦160423 that pit, smoke came up out of it like the smoke of a large furnace¦160438, and the smoke darkened¦160443 the sun¦160445 and the air.\x + \xo 9:2: \xt Gen 19:8.\x*
\v 3 Then¦160456 locusts¦160459 came out of the smoke¦160457 and \add descended\add* on the land, and they were given¦160464 \add stinging\add* power like the large scorpions¦160472 of the earth.\x + \xo 9:3: \xt Exo 10:12-15.\x*
\v 4 \add However the locusts\add* were told that they¦160481 shouldn't harm the grass¦160484 or any green¦160490 plants or trees, but only those people¦160497 who didn't have God's mark on their¦160508 foreheads¦160509.\x + \xo 9:4: \xt Eze 9:4.\x*
\v 5 They weren't given¦160512 power to kill¦160517 them, but only to torment them for five¦160524 months¦160523, and their¦160528 torment was like that of a scorpion¦160531 when it strikes¦160534 a person¦160535.
\v 6 People in those¦160540 days¦160539 will try to die, but won't be able to—they will long to die, but death will run away from them.\x + \xo 9:6: \xt Yob 3:21; Jer 8:3.\x*
\p
\v 7 The locusts¦160572 looked like horses¦160576 that had been prepared¦160577 for battle, with something¦160580 on their heads¦160583 that were similar to golden crowns¦160586 and their faces being like human¦160596 faces.\x + \xo 9:7: \xt Yoel 2:4.\x*
\v 8 Their¦160607 hair was like women's¦160603 hair and their¦160607 teeth were like lions' teeth.\x + \xo 9:8: \xt Yoel 1:6.\x*
\v 9 They wore chestplates that seemed to be made of iron, and the sound of their¦160623 wings¦160622 was like the roar of many horses¦160627 rushing into battle pulling chariots¦160626.\x + \xo 9:9: \xt Yoel 2:5.\x*
\v 10 They had tails with stingers¦160639 like scorpions¦160637 which had the power¦160648 to harm people¦160655 for five¦160657 months¦160656.
\v 11 They had a king¦160666 in charge of them who's the messenger¦160669 of the deep pit—his name is ‘Destroyer’. (‘Abaddon¦160678’ in Hebrew and ‘Apollyon¦160689’ in Greek.)
\p
\v 12 The first terrible event has now passed, but there are still¦160698 two¦160700 more to follow.
\s1 The sixth trumpet brings the second terror
\p
\v 13 Then¦160707 the sixth¦160707 messenger¦160708 blew his trumpet¦160709 and¦160710 I heard¦160711 a voice¦160712 coming from the corners of the golden¦160721 altar¦160719 in front of \nd God¦160725\nd*,\x + \xo 9:13: \xt Exo 30:1-3.\x*
\v 14 that was telling the sixth¦160729 messenger (with the trumpet¦160736), “Release¦160738 the four¦160740 messengers that are tied up by the large Euphrates River.”
\v 15 So¦160757 the four¦160759 messengers¦160760 who had been prepared¦160762 for this exact time were released to kill¦160776 a third¦160778 of humankind.
\v 16 I heard¦160796 someone say how many mounted soldiers there were—there were 200 million of them,
\v 17 and this is what the horses and their riders looked like in my vision¦160807: the soldiers \add wore\add* chestplates that were \add red like\add* fire, \add blue like\add* sapphire, and \add yellow like\add* sulfur. The heads of the horses were like lions' heads, and fire, smoke¦160838, and fumes of burning sulfur came out of their mouths¦160833.
\v 18 These three¦160844 plagues¦160845 (fire¦160856, smoke¦160860, and burning sulfur¦160864 coming out of their¦160870 mouths¦160869) killed¦160847 one third¦160850 of humankind
\v 19 because the horses' power¦160876 is in their mouths¦160886 and in their tails, because their tails are like snakes, having¦160903 heads¦160906 that injure¦160910 \add people\add*.
\p
\v 20 \add However,\add* the rest of humankind that hadn't been killed¦160918 by those plagues¦160921, didn't repent¦160927 of their¦160933 actions and didn't stop worshipping demons¦160939 and idols \add made\add* of gold and silver¦160948 and bronze¦160952 and stone¦160957 and wood—idols that can't see, can't hear¦160968, and can't walk¦160970.\x + \xo 9:20: \xt Psa 115:4-7; 135:15-17; Dan 5:23.\x*
\v 21 They \add also\add* didn't repent¦160973 of their murdering¦160977 or of their sorcery¦160982, nor of their sexual immorality or of their stealing.

\s1 The messenger and the small scroll
\rem /s1 The Angel with the Little Scroll; The Angel and the Small Scroll
\p
\v 1 Then¦160998 \add in the vision\add* I saw¦160997 another¦160998 powerful messenger¦160999 coming¦161001 down from heaven¦161004 wrapped in a cloud¦161006 and with a rainbow¦161010 above his head. His¦161016 face¦161020 was like the sun¦161024 and his feet¦161027 were like pillars¦161030 of fire¦161032,
\v 2 and he was holding a small¦161041 opened¦161043 scroll¦161041. He set his right¦161051 foot \add down\add* on the ocean and his left \add foot down\add* on the land
\v 3 and shouted in a loud¦161068 voice like a lion¦161070 roaring¦161071, and when he shouted, the seven¦161078 thunders¦161080 spoke¦161076 out in their own voices.
\v 4 When the seven thunders spoke, I was going¦161098 to write \add down what they said\add* but I heard¦161103 a voice¦161104 from heaven¦161108 that said, “Keep what the seven thunders have said secret, and don't¦161120 write it down.”
\p
\v 5 Then¦161126 the messenger¦161126 that I'd seen straddling the ocean and the land raised his¦161141 right¦161143 hand¦161139\x + \xo 10:5-7: \xt Exo 20:11; Deu 32:40; Dan 12:7; Amos 3:7.\x*
\v 6 and made an oath by the one living¦161151 through all the ages and who created¦161158 heaven¦161160 and everything in it and the earth¦161167 and everything in it, and the sea¦161174 and everything in it, saying, “There won't be any more delay,
\v 7 but¦161186 at the time when the seventh¦161193 messenger¦161194 will speak and blow his trumpet¦161200, then the hidden purposes of \nd God¦161207\nd* will come to be, just like he told his slaves¦161213 the prophets¦161219 \add long ago\add*.”
\p
\v 8 Then¦161223 the one whom I had heard¦161225 speak¦161230 from heaven¦161228 spoke to me again¦161229, saying¦161235, “Go and get the open scroll¦161240 from the hand¦161248 of the messenger¦161250 who is straddling the ocean and the land.”\x + \xo 10:8-10: \xt Exo 2:8–3:3.\x*
\v 9 So¦161262 I went¦161261 to the angel and asked him to give¦161268 me the little¦161273 scroll¦161273, and he answered, “Take it and eat it. At first it'll taste sweet¦161296 like honey¦161298, but afterwards it'll be uncomfortable in your¦161286 stomach¦161289.”
\v 10 So¦161301 I took¦161300 that little¦161303 scroll¦161303 from the angel's hand¦161307 and ate¦161325 it, and it tasted sweet¦161322 like honey¦161321, but my¦161318 stomach¦161330 hurt afterwards
\v 11 and they¦161333 told me, “You have to speak out God's message about many nations¦161344 and people¦161341 groups and language groups and kings¦161348.”
\c 11
\s1 The two witnesses
\rem /s1 The Two Witnesses
\p
\v 1 Then¦161354 I was given¦161353 a measuring¦161367 stick and told, “Go and message God's temple¦161369 and the altar¦161374 and the people who're worshipping there,\x + \xo 11:1: \xt Exo 40:3; Zech 2:1-2.\x*
\v 2 but exclude the outer courtyard¦161383. Don't measure¦161400 that because¦161401 it's been given¦161402 to the non-Jews, and they'll tread¦161411 \add around\add* the holy city¦161408 for three and a half years.\x + \xo 11:2: \xt Luk 21:24.\x*
\v 3 Then¦161420 I'll give my¦161423 two witnesses¦161422 \add the ability\add* to speak out God's message for six months, while dressed in mourning garb.
\p
\v 4 Those are the two olive¦161438 trees¦161438 and the two lampstands¦161443 that stand before¦161445 the \nd master¦161447\nd* of the earth¦161450.\x + \xo 11:4: \xt Zech 4:3,11-14.\x*
\v 5 If anyone wants to harm them, fire¦161462 comes out of their mouth¦161466 and¦161468 burns up their enemies¦161471, \add yes\add*, if anyone wants to harm them then they deserve to be killed¦161488.
\v 6 Those witnesses have the power to stop the rain so that it doesn't rain while they're speaking out, and they have power to turn \add rivers and lakes\add* into blood¦161522, and to damage the earth¦161526 with every¦161528 type of plague¦161530 just as often¦161531 as they want.\x + \xo 11:6: a \xt 1Ki 17:1; \xo b \xt Exo 7:17-19; \xo c \xt 1Sam 4:8.\x*
\p
\v 7 When \add the two witnesses\add* have finished¦161542 speaking out, the beast that comes up from the deep, dark pit will attack them. It'll overpower them and \add then\add* kill them.\x + \xo 11:7: a \xt Dan 7:7; Rev 13:5-7; 17:8; \xo b \xt Dan 7:21.\x*
\v 8 Their¦161576 corpses¦161574 will \add lie\add* on the road¦161579 of the great¦161583 city¦161581, which¦161584 in spiritual¦161586 terms is called¦161585 Sodom¦161587 and/or Egypt¦161589 \add (Mitsrayim¦161591)\add*—where¦161590 their¦161576 \nd master¦161593\nd* was executed¦161596 on a stake¦161596.\x + \xo 11:8: \xt Isa 1:9-10.\x*
\v 9 People from every nation¦161610 and tribe¦161606 and language will look at their corpses for three¦161618 and a half days¦161617 and will prevent their corpses from being put into a tomb¦161632.
\v 10 Those who're living¦161636 on the earth will be happy about it and celebrate and send gifts¦161648 to each another¦161652 because¦161654 those two¦161657 prophets¦161658 had tormented¦161662 them,
\v 11 but after¦161670 three¦161672 and a half days¦161673, God's breath of life¦161679 will enter into them and they'll stand up. The people who see that will be terrified.\x + \xo 11:11: \xt Eze 37:10.\x*
\v 12 Then the two witnesses will hear a loud voice¦161710 from the sky¦161727 telling them, “Come up here.” Then they'll go up to heaven¦161716 in a cloud¦161730 as their¦161737 enemies¦161736 watch them go up.\x + \xo 11:12: \xt 2Ki 2:11.\x*
\v 13 At that same time, there will be a huge earthquake which will cause a tenth¦161751 of the city¦161753 to collapse. That'll kill 7,000 people¦161761 and the rest will be terrified and will acknowledge the \nd God¦161775\nd* of heaven¦161777.\x + \xo 11:13: \xt Rev 6:12; 16:18.\x*
\p
\v 14 The second¦161781 terror has then passed, but the third¦161789 will be coming¦161791 soon.
\s1 The seventh trumpet brings the third terror
\p
\v 15 Then¦161795 the seventh¦161796 messenger¦161797 blew his trumpet¦161798, and voices¦161802 in heaven¦161806 shouted loudly, “The kingdom of the world¦161816 has become the kingdom of our¦161819 \nd master¦161818\nd* and of his \nd messiah¦161822\nd*, and he will reign¦161825 through all the ages.”\x + \xo 11:15: \xt Exo 15:18; Dan 2:44; 7:14,27.\x*
\v 16 The twenty-four¦161834 elders¦161837 sitting¦161846 on their thrones¦161849 in front of God knelt down with their faces¦161856 to the ground and¦161858 worshipped God,
\v 17 saying¦161862,
\q1 “\nd Master¦161866\nd*, \nd God¦161872\nd*, ruler of everything, we thank¦161863 you,

\q1 You have taken¦161884 your¦161888 incredible power¦161887
\q2 and have started to reign¦161893.
\q1
\v 18 The nations¦161896 were enraged,\x + \xo 11:18: a \xt Psa 2:5; 110:5; \xo b \xt Psa 115:13.\x*
\q2 but your anger¦161902 has arrived.
\q1 It's the time¦161907 to judge¦161910 the dead¦161909

\p
\v 19 Then¦161952 God's temple in heaven¦161959 was opened¦161951, and the \add wooden\add* chest containing his agreement appeared in his temple.

\p
\v 1 Then¦161993 a \add miraculous\add* sign¦161992 appeared in heaven¦161997: a woman¦161998 clothed¦162000 with the sun¦162002, and with the moon¦162006 under her feet¦162010, and a crown¦162017 of twelve¦162019 starts on her head.
\v 2 She was about to give birth¦162029 and was crying¦162027 out in pain and agony.
\p
\v 3 Another \add miraculous\add* sign¦162036 appeared in heaven¦162039, and wow, a huge, red dinosaur with seven heads, ten horns¦162051, and seven crowns¦162060 on his¦162057 heads.\x + \xo 12:3: \xt Dan 7:7.\x*
\v 4 His¦162065 tail swept a third¦162068 of the stars¦162071 out of the sky¦162075 and hurled them down to earth¦162082, then he stood¦162086 in front of the woman¦162091 who was about to give birth, so that when the child¦162099 was delivered, he could devour¦162101 it.\x + \xo 12:4: \xt Dan 8:10.\x*
\v 5 The woman gave birth to a son who's going¦162108 to rule all the nations¦162112 with an iron scepter, and he was snatched¦162117 away to \nd God¦162124\nd* and to his¦162129 throne¦162128,\x + \xo 12:5: a \xt Isa 66:7; \xo b \xt Psa 2:9.\x*
\v 6 and the woman¦162132 fled into the wilderness¦162136 where¦162137 \nd God¦162145\nd* had prepared¦162141 a place¦162140 for her so that they might nourish¦162149 her there for three and a half years.
\rem /s1 Michael Defeats the Dragon
\p
\v 7 Then¦162159 a battle began in heaven¦162162, with Micha'el and his messengers making war on the dinosaur. But¦162159 the dinosaur and his messengers fought \add back\add*,\x + \xo 12:7: \xt Dan 10:13,21; 12:1; Jude 9.\x*
\v 8 however the dinosaur couldn't beat them, so after that they weren't able to stay in heaven¦162202 anymore¦162199.
\v 9 Thus the huge dinosaur was thrown \add out\add*—that ancient¦162214 snake called¦162216 ‘the devil’ and ‘Satan¦162220’—the one who deceived¦162222 the whole¦162225 world¦162224.

\p
\v 10 Then¦162239 I heard¦162238 a loud voice¦162239 in heaven¦162244 saying¦162245, “Now our¦162258 God's salvation¦162249 and power¦162252 and kingdom¦162255 have come, and the authority¦162262 of his¦162266 \nd messiah¦162264\nd*, because¦162267 the accuser of the believers¦162274 has been thrown¦162268 \add out\add*—the one who spent day¦162284 and night¦162286 in front of God accusing them.\x + \xo 12:10: \xt Yob 1:9-11; Zech 3:1.\x*
\v 11 They conquered him¦162291 by means of the lamb's blood¦162294 and by the message¦162300 in their¦162305 testimony¦162303. Indeed, they were prepared to die \add if necessary\add*.
\v 12 So, be glad \add you\add* heavens¦162318 and those who shelter¦162325 in them. The earth¦162332 and the sea¦162338 won't have a good ending because the devil¦162343 has gone down to you and he's very angry because he knows he doesn't have much time¦162352 left.”
\rem /s1 The Dragon Fights Again on Earth
\p
\v 13 When the dinosaur realised that God had thrown¦162360 him \add down\add* to the earth¦162363, he tried to attack the woman¦162369 who had given birth to the son.
\v 14 But¦162379 two¦162383 large, eagle¦162388 wings¦162385 were given¦162378 to the woman¦162381 so that she could fly \add away\add* to the wilderness¦162395, to her¦162399 place¦162398 where¦162401 she'll be nourished¦162402 away from the snake for three and a half \add years\add*.\x + \xo 12:14: \xt Dan 7:25; 12:7.\x*
\v 15 Then¦162418 the snake poured water¦162432 out of his¦162428 mouth¦162427 like a river¦162434 towards the woman¦162431 so that the current would sweep her¦162437 away,
\v 16 but the ground helped the woman by opening up a big hole, and so the flood that the dinosaur poured out from his¦162471 mouth disappeared into it.
\v 17 The dinosaur was furious with the woman and went¦162480 away to battle against the rest of her¦162490 children¦162489, the ones obeying God's commands¦162494 and \add believing\add* \nd Yeshua's¦162503\nd* testimony¦162500.

\rem /s1 The Beast out of the Sea
\v 2 The sea creature that I saw was like a leopard¦162553 with feet¦162556 like a bear and a mouth like a lion¦162567, and the dinosaur gave it his power¦162575 and his throne¦162579 and wide-ranging authority¦162582.\x + \xo 13:2: \xt Dan 7:4-6.\x*
\v 3 One of the heads¦162591 of the sea creature looked as if someone had wounded it so that it had died, but that wound had healed¦162605 and as a result, all the people of the earth¦162614 marvelled¦162608 at the sea creature and \add obeyed\add* it.
\v 4 They worshipped the dinosaur because¦162626 he had given authority¦162632 to the sea creature, and they worshipped the sea creature, saying¦162641, “Who is like this sea creature and who is able to battle against it?”
\p
\v 5 The sea creature was given a mouth¦162656 so it could speak¦162657 out arrogant and anti-God statements, and it was given authority¦162667 to act for three and a half years.\x + \xo 13:5-6: \xt Dan 7:8,25; 11:36.\x*
\v 6 So¦162678 it started speaking out anti-God statements, as well as speaking out against¦162685 God's name¦162690 and his¦162691 \add home and\add* those \add who live\add* in heaven¦162701.
\v 7 It was given permission to battle against the believers and to conquer them, and it¦162718 was given authority¦162719 over every¦162722 tribe¦162723 and people¦162725 and language and nation¦162730.\x + \xo 13:7: \xt Dan 7:21.\x*

\p
\v 11 Then¦162809 I saw¦162808 a second wild animal¦162810 come up from the earth¦162815. It had two¦162819 small horns¦162818 on its head like a lamb, but it spoke like a dinosaur.
\v 12 This land animal carries out all the orders¦162850 of the sea creature and¦162844 insists that the people who live on the earth¦162843 worship the sea creature—the one that almost died except its¦162864 wound¦162861 healed¦162859.
\v 13 The land animal also did amazing miracles and it even caused fire¦162871 to fall from the sky¦162880 down to the earth¦162887 that people¦162890 could see.
\v 14 The dinosaur gave¦162904 the land animal the power to do these miracles on behalf of the sea creature. The land animal used the miracles to deceive¦162892 the people who live on the earth, telling¦162910 them to make an idol that looked like the sea creature that had survived a sword¦162934 wound¦162927 that seemed to kill it.
\v 15 The dinosaur \add also\add* gave¦162939 the land animal the power to make that idol live and¦162956 so the idol that looked like the sea creature was able to speak¦162951. The land animal was able to execute anyone who refused to worship the idol
\v 16 and it¦162976 \add also\add* required each person, whether important or not, and whether rich or poor, free or slave¦162996, to have a mark on their right¦163010 hand¦163007 or on their forehead¦163016.
\v 17 Then the land beast ordered that no one could buy or sell anything if they don't¦163022 have that mark. The mark was the name of the sea creature or the number¦163048 that stood for its¦163051 name.
\p
\v 18 This \add calls for\add* wisdom¦163054: Let anyone who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, because¦163069 it's the number of a man¦163070 and¦163072 his number is 666.\f + \fr 13:18 \ft There are some manuscripts that have the number as 616 (XIS) rather than 666 (XES).

\v 5 and a name was written¦164733 on her¦164731 forehead¦164730. The name was a mystery: ‘Babylon¦164735 the Great, the Mother of Prostitutes and the Abominations of the Earth.’
\v 6 I noticed that the woman¦164751 was drunk¦164752 from the blood of the believers and from the blood of the witnesses¦164766 of \nd Yeshua¦164767\nd*. and, having¦164770 seen her, I wondered a great¦164773 wonder.
\p When I saw heard, I was incredibly amazed
\v 7 but the messenger¦164780 asked me, “Why are you astounded? I'll tell you the mystery¦164789 of the woman¦164791 and of the wild animal¦164794 with the seven¦164801 heads¦164802 and the ten¦164805 horns¦164806 that's carrying her¦164797.
\v 8 The wild animal that you saw used to be \add here\add* and isn't \add anymore\add* but is about to come up from the abyss¦164821.

\v 9 Here's the mind \add understanding\add* wisdom¦164871: The seven heads¦164874 are seven hills that the woman¦164881 is sitting¦164882 on, and they're seven rulers.
\v 10 Five \add of the rulers\add* have fallen \add and\add* one is \add still there\add*, \add but\add* the other¦164901 one hasn't come¦164906 yet, and when he does, it'll be necessary¦164910 for him to remain¦164911 a while.
\v 11 The wild animal¦164915 that used to be \add here\add* and isn't \add anymore\add* is itself also an eighth¦164925, but it's from the seven¦164930 and is heading towards destruction¦164934.

\v 12 The ten horns¦164939 that you saw¦164941 are ten rulers who haven't received¦164950 a \add domain\add* yet \add to rule\add*, but they are receiving¦164958 authority¦164952 as rulers with the wild animal¦164961 for one hour¦164957.\x + \xo 17:12: \xt Dan 7:24.\x*
\v 13 They're \add all unified\add*, and they¦164977 give their¦164974 power¦164969 and authority¦164972 to the wild animal¦164976.
\v 14 They'll go to battle against the lamb, but the lamb will conquer them because¦164989 he is \nd master¦164990\nd* of masters¦164991 and king¦164994 of kings¦164995 and the ones with him are called¦165000 and chosen¦165002 and faithful¦165004.”
\p
\v 15 Then¦165007 the angel said to me, “The waters¦165011 that you¦165013 saw¦165013, where¦165015 the prostitute¦165017 sits, are peoples¦165020 and multitudes and nations¦165025 and languages¦165027.

\v 12 \add The city\add* had wall that was both wide and high¦167305, with twelve gates and twelve messengers¦167315 at the gates. The gates had the names¦167318 of the twelve tribes¦167328 (\add from\add* Israel's twelve sons¦167330) written on them.\x + \xo 21:12-13: \xt Eze 48:30-35.\x*
\v 13 There were three gates on the east, three on the north¦167339, three on the south¦167350, and three on the west.
\v 14 The city¦167362 wall had twelve foundation¦167365 \add stones\add*, and they had the names¦167373 of the lamb's twelve missionaries \add written\add* on them.
\p
\v 15 The \add messenger\add* speaking¦167381 to me had a golden¦167387 measuring rod so that he could measure the city¦167391 and its¦167395 gates¦167394 and wall.\x + \xo 21:15: \xt Eze 40:3.\x*
\v 16 The city was laid out square with the length equalling the width. Using the rod, the \add messenger\add* measured¦167417 the city at 2.2km \add on each edge\add*, with the length, width, and height¦167435 all being equal.
\v 17 He also measured the wall to be 70m using normal measurements.\f + \fr 21:17 \ft It's not stated if that's the \em height\em* or the \em thickness\em* of the city wall.\f*
\v 18 The wall was made of \add green\add* jasper¦167466 \add stone\add* and¦167467 the city¦167469 itself was pure gold¦167470 but as clear as glass¦167474.\x + \xo 21:18-21: \xt Isa 54:11-12.\x*
\v 19 The foundations of the city's wall were adorned¦167486 with \add many different kinds of\add* precious¦167485 stones¦167484. The first¦167491 foundation was jasper¦167492, the second¦167495 sapphire¦167496, the third¦167499 chalcedony¦167500, the fourth¦167502 emerald¦167503,

\v 21 The twelve gates were twelve pearls—each one of the gates individually was from one pearl—and the city¦167554 street was pure gold¦167555—transparent¦167560 like glass¦167558.

\v 23 The city¦167586 doesn't need the sun¦167591 or moon¦167594 to illuminate it because¦167600 God's radiance illuminates it, and its¦167609 lamp is the lamb.\x + \xo 21:23: \xt Isa 60:19-20.\x*
