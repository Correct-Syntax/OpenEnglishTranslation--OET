\mt1 Revelation
\mt2 of Yeshua the messiah
\is1 Introduction
\ip \bk Yohan's (John's) revelation of Yeshua (Jesus) the messiah\bk* concerns events that will happen in the future. This was written long ago in a time when the believers were persecuted due to their faith in the master Yeshua, the messiah, and Yohan himself had forcibly exiled to Patmos Island by the Roman authorities and held there. Yohan's main purpose for writing this was to give hope to the believers and to encourage them to persevere in their faith despite their persecution.
\ip A major portion of what's written in this document is the revelation of Yeshua the messiah to Yohan of incredible signs and all those symbols have a meaning and interpretation. At the time of writing, some were likely understood by the Christians of the time, but now, some of the symbols are very hard to interpret, and there's been a large variety of interpretations from different people. But even though it's like that, due also signs easy just understand like sungey iyan igpasabut the power and katenged, and the kampilan iyan igpasabut the samuk. Inlibed-libed of many and of various paahi the themes of this document by means of signs. But easy just understand the very important it's written here: destruction iya of God the all enemy din by means of ki the messiah Yeshua, and egdasahan din also the people din migpabulus migpamakey, and egpakalemung them kandin of without ending. And/Now due egpakapahale our there in the final chapter: this concerns the new sky and planet that God will create and concerning the new Yerusalem that will descend from the sky.

\s1 Yohan sees the messiah
\rem /s1 Vision of the Son of Man; A Vision of Christ; One like a Son of Man
\p
\v 9 I, John, am your¦156560 brother¦156559 and partner in the suffering \add that's typical of those who follow\add* Yeshua. \add I've been exiled to\add* Patmos¦156587 Island where I endure¦156572 because¦156588 I believe God's message¦156591 and \nd Yeshua's¦156598\nd* testimony¦156597 and \add look forward to\add* his kingdom¦156570.
\v 10 One Sunday \add while meditating\add*, \add God's\add* \nd spirit¦156603\nd* gave me a vision, and¦156608 I heard¦156609 a voice¦156613 behind¦156611 me that seemed as loud¦156614 as a trumpet¦156618 blast
\v 11 that said, “Write down what you¦156635 see \add here\add* on a scroll¦156640 and send¦156642 it to the seven¦156644 assemblies¦156645 \add of believers\add*—to \add the cities of\add* Ephesus¦156650, Smyrna¦156653, Pergamum¦156657, Thyatira¦156660, Sardis¦156665, Philadelphia¦156668, and to Laodicea¦156671.”
\p
\v 12 Then I turned to see who was talking¦156679 to me, and I saw¦156686 seven¦156687 golden¦156689 lamp holders,
\v 13 and standing among them was a man who looked like humanity's child,\f + \fr 1:13 \ft It's not certain what was meant here: either ‘a man who looked like humanity's child’ or ‘a form that looked like a human man’.\f* wearing a long robe with a golden¦156712 sash around His¦156701 chest.\x + \xo 1:13: a \xt Dan 7:13; \xo b \xt Dan 10:5.\x*
\v 14 His¦156718 hair¦156721 was gleaming white like wool or snow and his¦156718 eyes¦156731 were \add bright\add* like a fiery flame¦156734.\x + \xo 1:14: \xt Dan 7:9.\x*
\v 15 His¦156739 feet¦156738 shone like bronze¦156741 that had been refined¦156745 in a furnace¦156744, and his¦156739 voice was like the sound of a \add river of rushing\add* water¦156754.\x + \xo 1:15: \xt Eze 1:24; 43:2.\x*
\v 16 He was holding¦156757 seven¦156766 stars¦156765 in his right¦156761 hand¦156763 and a sharp¦156774 sword¦156772 was extending from his mouth¦156770, and his face¦156778 was like the sun¦156783 shining¦156784 at its brightest.
\v 17 And when I saw¦156791 him, I quickly lay at his feet¦156797, \add breathless\add* like a dead¦156801 man, but he placed his right¦156806 hand¦156806 on me, and told me, “Don't be afraid. \em I am\em* the first¦156819 and the last.\x + \xo 1:17: \xt Isa 44:6; 48:12; Rev 2:8; 22:13.\x*
\v 18 I lived and died \add here on the earth\add*, but look, \add now\add* I'm alive \add again\add* and will live for all eternity, and I control the keys over death¦156844 and over hell.

\v 2 “I know about your activities and work, and your endurance¦156950 and that you can not tolerate evil¦156957 people, and that you have investigated the ones calling themselves¦156964 missionaries but are not, and you have found¦156972 them to be frauds.
\v 3 \add I'm aware that\add* you've endured¦156978 and even suffered \add persecution\add* because¦156985 you've \add believed in\add* me, but you've never given up.
\v 4 However, I do have something against¦156997 you: you've abandoned the love¦157001 that you first¦157004 had.
\v 5 So¦157010 \add now, you need to\add* remember¦157009 where¦157011 you've fallen¦157012 from, and repent and repeat how you behaved at the beginning, but if you don't, I'll come to you and if you don't repent, I'll remove¦157030 your¦157033 lampstand¦157032 from its place¦157036.
\v 6 But you do have this going for you: you hate what the \add disciples of\add* Nicolaus are doing,\f + \fr 2:7 \ft Nicolaus' disciples ate food that had been sacrificed to idols and committed sexual sins.\f* just like I do.

\v 10 Don't be afraid about what you're¦157149 going to suffer¦157151.

\v 14 But I do have a few things against¦157272 you: you have some people there¦157278 who hold to \add the ancient prophet\add* Balaam's teaching.\x + \xo 2:14: a \xt Num 22:5,7; 31:16; Deu 23:4; \xo b \xt Num 25:1-3.\x* He taught¦157281 \add Moab's king\add*, Balak¦157289, how to tempt¦157293 the Israelis and to eat \add food\add* that had been sacrificed¦157300 to idols, and to be sexually¦157302 immoral¦157302.
