\s1 The punishment of God to King Ahazziah
\rem /s1 Elisha and the house of Ahab; Elijah and King Ahaziah; The Lord's Judgment on Ahaziah; Elijah Denounces Ahaziah; Elijah Confronts King Ahaziah
\p
\v 1 After the death¦171792 of \add Israel's King\add* Ahab, Moab¦171789 rebelled¦171788 against Israel.
\p
\v 2 \add One day, King\add* Ahazziah fell through¦171797 a lattice¦171798 in his upper¦171799 room in Shomron¦171801 \add (Samaria)\add* and was injured¦171802, \add ≈so\add* he sent¦171803 messengers¦171804 to go¦171807 and ask Ekron's God¦171811 Baal-Zevuv if he would recover.
\v 3 \add ≈But\add* Yahweh's messenger told Eliyyah (from Tishbe¦171826), “\add ≈Leave here\add* \add and\add* go¦171828 and meet the Shomron¦171833 king's messengers and \add ≈ask\add* them, ‘Is it because¦171836 there's¦171837 no God in Israel¦171840 that you're all going¦171842 to inquire¦171843 from Ekron's God Baal-Zevuv?
\v 4 \add ≈Becase of that,\add* Yahweh says that \add the king\add* won't get out of the bed that he's lying in—he's definitely going to die.”
\p \add ≈So¦171849\add* Eliyyah \add told them and\add* \add ≈continued\add* on his way.
\v 5 \add ≈When\add* the messengers¦171870 returned to \add @the king\add*, he \add ≈asked\add* them, “What's this? \add ≈Why are you¦171877 back here\add* \add so soon\add*?”
\p
\v 6 “A man¦171881 \add ≈came¦171883\add* to meet us,” they told him, “and he said to us, ‘Go \add and\add* return¦171888 to the king¦171891 who sent you, and tell him that Yahweh says this: Is it because¦171901 there's no God in Israel¦171905 that you are sending¦171907 \add messengers\add* to inquire¦171908 from Ekron's God Baal-Zevuv? Therefore you'll never leave that bed that you're lying in but you'll certainly die \add in it\add*.’ ”
\p
\v 7 “What¦171938 was the man¦171932 \add ≈like\add*,” the king \add ≈asked\add* them, “who meet you and \add ≈gave you all that message\add*?”
\p
\v 8 “\add ≈He had a cloak made of animal\add* hair,” they \add ≈answered\add*, “and \add ≈was wearing a leather belt¦171948\add*.”
\p “\add Ah,\add*” said \add @the king\add*. “That's Eliyyah \add ≈from Tishbe¦171954\add*.”
\p
\v 9 \add ≈So¦171957\add* he sent¦171957 a captain with his fifty soldiers to look for \add @Eliyyah\add* and they found him sitting¦171966 on the top of a hill. The captain \add ≈called out\add*, “Man of God¦171974, the king¦171975 \add ≈wants to see you\add*.”
\p
\v 10 \add ≈But¦171979\add* Eliyyah replied, “\add ≈Well,\add* if I am a man of God¦171989, let fire come down from the sky and consume¦171996 you and your \add ≈men\add*,” and fire came down from the sky, and it \add ≈burnt up the captain and his men\add*.
\p
\v 11 \add ≈So¦172012\add* \add @the king\add* sent another¦172018 captain with his fifty men and they went to where Eliyyah was and called out to him, “Prophet, the king commands¦172015 that you come \add ≈with us right now\add*.”
\p
\v 12 \add Again\add* Eliyyah replied, “If I am a man of God, let fire come down from the sky and consume¦172046 you and your \add ≈men\add*,” and the God's fire came down from the sky, and it \add ≈burnt up the captain and his men\add*.
\p
\v 13 \add ≈So¦172064\add* \add @the king\add* sent¦172065 a third captain with his fifty men. They went¦172072 to where Eliyyah was and the officer knelt down in front of him and \add ≈pleaded\add*, “Prophet, I \add ≈beg\add* you, be kind to me and my fifty soldiers, and don't kill us.
\v 14 Listen, fire¦172102 came down from the sky and burnt up the first¦172112 two¦172109 captains and their¦172115 \add ≈men, but please treat my life¦172118 as valuable in your¦172119 sight¦172119\add*.”
\p
\v 15 Then Yahweh's messenger told Eliyyah, “Go with \add #them\add*. Don't be afraid¦172132 of him.”
\p So Eliyyah went with \add #them\add* to the king¦172139
\v 16 and told him, “Yahweh says that you sent messengers¦172151 to inquire from Ekron's God Baal-Zevuv, the god of Ekron \add ≈as if\add* there's no God in Israel¦172161 to \add ≈ask\add*? Therefore, \add he says,\add* \add ≈you certainly won't get off that bed that you're on\add* because you'll die \add in it\add*.”
\rem /s1 Death of Ahaziah
\p
\v 17 \add ≈So¦172179\add* \add @King Ahazziah\add* died \add ≈just as Yahweh had said via\add* Eliyyah. Then¦172179 \add Ahazziah's younger brother\add* Yehoram \add (Joram)\add* became¦172187 king in his place¦172189, because \add @Ahazziah\add* \add ≈didn't have any sons\add*. \add This happened\add* in the second year \add of the reign\add* of Yehoshafat's son King Yehoram over Yehudah.
\v 18 \add ≈Everything else that Ahazziah did is written¦172214 in the book of the events\add* of the kings¦172220 of Israel¦172221.

\s1 Eliyyah gets taken up to heaven
\rem /s1 Elijah Taken into Heaven; Elijah Taken Up to Heaven; Elijah Is Taken Up to Heaven; Elijah Ascends to Heaven
\p
\v 1 \add ≈One day as\add* Eliyyah and Elisha \add ≈had left\add* Gilgal¦172237, Yahweh took Eliyyah up to heaven¦172231 in a storm.
\v 2 Eliyyah had told Elisha, “Now, you stay here because Yahweh has \add ≈told me to go\add* to Bethel.”
\p “By the life of Yahweh,” Elisha \add ≈had responded¦172239\add*, “and by the life of your spirit, I won't leave¦172266 you.” \add ≈So¦172239 they'd headed\add* to Bethel.
\p
\v 3 \add ≈Also\add* the \add ≈prophets-in-training\add* who were in Bethel had gone out to Elisha and told him, “Do you know that today Yahweh¦172293 is going to take your¦172295 master¦172293 \add ≈away from you\add*?”
\p “I \add ≈already know that\add*,” he'd \add ≈replied\add*. “\add ≈Don't say anything\add*.”
\p
\v 4 Then¦172303 Eliyyah \add ≈had informed\add* Elisha, “Yahweh has sent me to Yericho¦172327 \add (Jericho)\add*. You stay here.”
\p He'd \add ≈answered\add*, “By the life of Yahweh and the life of your spirit, I won't leave¦172325 you.” \add ≈So¦172303 they had gone\add* to Jericho.
\p
\v 5 The \add ≈prophets-in-training\add* who were in Yericho¦172335 \add ≈had approached\add* Elisha and \add ≈briefed\add* him, “Do you know that today Yahweh¦172348 is taking your¦172350 master¦172348 \add ≈away from you\add*?”
\p “\add ≈Yes, I realise that\add*,” he'd \add ≈responded¦172339\add*. “\add ≈Say no more\add*.”
\p
\v 6 \add ≈Again\add* Eliyyah had told him, “You stay here, because Yahweh has sent me to the Yordan.”
\p And he'd \add ≈countered\add*, “By the life of Yahweh and the life of your spirit, I won't leave¦172378 you.” \add ≈So¦172358 the two of them had gone there together\add*.
\v 7 \add ≈Fifty of the prophets-in-training had also gone, but they'd stood back watching from a distance¦172389, so the two¦172390 of them had stood there\add* by the Yordan¦172394.
\v 8 Then¦172396 Eliyyah had taken off his cloak and \add ≈doubled it over\add* and hit the river \add with it\add*. The water¦172405 divided¦172406 \add ≈leaving a dry path and the two of them had walked across\add* \add to the other¦172408 side\add*.
\v 9 As they'd crossed¦172414 over, Eliyyah had told Elisha, “\add ≈Tell me what you'd like me to do for you before¦172425 I get taken¦172426 away\add*.”
\p “Please,” Elisha \add ≈had answered\add*, “\add ≈I'd like a\add* double amount of \add ≈the spirit¦172436 that you have\add*.”
\p
\v 10 “\add Oh,\add* \add ≈that's a difficult¦172440 request\add*,” \add @Eliyyah\add* \add ≈had responded¦172439\add*. “\add Well,\add* if you see¦172444 me being taken¦172446 \add ≈away\add* from you, \add ≈then you'll get what you asked¦172441 for, but if you miss seeing me go, you won't\add*.”
\p
\v 11 Then it had happened \add while\add* they were walking and talking¦172462 \add together\add*. Wow, a chariot¦172464 of fire and horses¦172467 of fire \add drove\add* between¦172470 the two of them, \add ≈separating¦172469 them\add*. Then Eliyyah went up to the heavens¦172475 in the gale.
\v 12 Elisha was watching, and he cried out, “My father, my father, Israel's chariot¦172484 and its horsemen¦172486.”
\rem /s1 Elisha Succeeds Elijah
\p \add ≈But¦172477 then\add* \add @Elisha\add* could no longer see him, and he grabbed his \add own\add* \add ≈cloak\add*, and tore \add #it\add* in half,
\v 13 and he picked¦172496 up Eliyyah's cloak¦172499 that had fallen¦172502 \add ≈down to the ground\add*. Then¦172496 he went¦172504 back and stood¦172505 on the bank of the Yordan,
\v 14 and he took¦172511 Eliyyah's cloak¦172514 and \add ≈hit the river\add* \add with it\add*, saying, “Where is Eliyyah's God¦172527 Yahweh?” \add ≈Then¦172511 as\add* he hit the water, \add ≈the river divided¦172537 into two parts\add* and Elisha crossed¦172540 \add ≈through the middle\add*.
\v 15 The \add ≈prophets-in-training\add* who were \add ≈on the Yericho¦172549 side, affirmed\add*, “\add ≈Elisha now has the spirit¦172553 that Eliyyah had\add*.” Then¦172543 they came¦172558 \add forward\add* to meet him and \add ≈knelt down in front of him\add* \add as a sign of respect\add*,
\v 16 and they \add ≈requested\add*, “Listen please, \add ≈fifty¦172575 of us here have military training\add*. Please, let them go¦172580 to search for your master¦172585, in case Yahweh's spirit¦172589 of Yahweh lifted him and \add ≈dropped\add* him on \add ≈a hill somewhere\add* or into one of the valleys¦172596.”
\p “\add ≈Don't waste your time\add*,” he \add ≈replied\add*.
\v 17 But¦172602 they \add ≈kept insisting so much that Elisha was embarrassed\add* and he said¦172608, “\add ≈Ok then\add*.”
\p \add ≈So¦172602\add* they sent¦172610 fifty¦172611 men, and they searched for three¦172614 days¦172616, but they didn't find \add @Eliyyah\add*.
\v 18 \add ≈When\add* they returned¦172620 to \add @Elisha\add* (he was staying in Yericho¦172624), he said¦172625 to them, “Didn't I \add ≈tell you not to bother\add*?”
\rem /s1 Miracles of Elisha; Healing of the Water; Elisha Performs Miracles; Elisha's First Miracles
\p
\v 19 Then¦172635 the \add ≈leaders\add* of \add Yericho\add* city said to Elisha, “Please, \add ≈this city is a good place to live\add*, just as my master¦172648 can see, but the water¦172650 \add supplies around here\add* are bad \add ≈so our crops don't thrive\add*.”
\p
\v 20 “Bring me a \add brand\add* new bowl,” he said¦172655, “and put salt there¦172662.” \add ≈So¦172655\add* they¦172664 brought \add ≈one\add* to him,
\v 21 and he went¦172667 out to the \add ≈spring\add* and threw¦172672 the salt at it, and \add ≈announced\add*, “Yahweh says¦172679 that he's healed¦172681 these¦172683 water¦172682 \add supplies\add* and \add ≈they'll no longer cause\add* death¦172689 or barrenness.”
\v 22 \add ≈So¦172692 now those water¦172693 supplies have been healthy and beneficial until¦172694 this day¦172695, just as Elisha had said\add*.
\rem /s1 Elisha Is Jeered
\p
\v 23 From there¦172704 \add @Elisha\add* went¦172714 to Bethel, and as he was going¦172710 up on the road, \add some\add* young¦172713 men came¦172714 out from the city¦172717, and \add ≈started\add* mocking him, saying, “\add ≈Keep moving, baldy. Keep moving, baldy\add*.”
\p
\v 24 Then¦172728 \add @Elisha\add* he turned¦172728 \add ≈back around\add* and \add ≈looked at\add* them, and he cursed¦172731 them in Yahweh's name¦172732. \add ≈Just then,\add* two female bears¦172736 came¦172734 out from the forrest and mauled¦172740 forty-two of \add *them\add*.
\p
\v 25 \add @Elisha\add* carried on from there to Mt. Karmel¦172751, and from there, he returned¦172753 to Shomron¦172754 \add (Samaria)\add*.

\p
\v 1 Ahab's son Yehoram \add (Jehoram)\add* became¦172761 king over Israel¦172764 in the eighteenth¦172767 year of King Yehoshafat's \add reign over\add* Yehudah, and he reigned from Shomron¦172765 \add (Samaria)\add* for twelve years.
\v 2 He did \add ≈what Yahweh had said\add* was evil, \add ≈but not as bad as\add* his father and mother¦172785 \add had been\add*, and he did remove¦172786 the pillar¦172789 of Baal that his father had made.
\v 3 \add ≈However,\add* he \add ≈committed similar sins¦172796 to those\add* of Nebat's son Yarobam¦172797 who had caused¦172803 Israel¦172806 to sin¦172803 and didn't \add ≈stop doing\add* them.
\rem /s1 War with Moab
\v 4 \add ≈Now\add* Moab's King Mesha¦172814 was a sheep¦172819 breeder, and he would \add ≈pay an annual tribute\add* to Israel's king of a hundred thousand young rams, plus the wool of a hundred thousand rams.
\v 5 \add ≈However,\add* after King Ahab died, Moab's king rebelled¦172836 against Israel's \add ≈control over them\add*.
\v 6 \add ≈So¦172843\add* King Yehoram¦172845 set out from Shomron¦172848 and¦172849 mustered¦172849 all \add ≈of Israel's fighters\add*.
\v 7 Then¦172856 he sent this message to King Yehoshafat¦172860 of Yehudah¦172863, “Moab's king has rebelled¦172867 against me. Will you \add ≈join in battle with me against them\add*?”
\p “I'll \add ≈join you\add*,” he \add ≈replied\add*. “\add ≈You and me are together. My people are your people, and my horses are your horses\add*.”
\v 8 “\add ≈What's our strategy? Which way should we go in\add*?” he \add ≈asked\add*.
\p “\add ≈Through\add* the Edom wilderness¦172892,” he \add ≈replied\add*.
\p
\v 9 \add ≈So¦172895\add* the kings of Israel¦172897, Yehudah, and Edom \add took their armies\add* on a seven¦172906 day trip \add circling around\add*, but they \add ≈didn't find enough\add* water¦172911 for the men or their animals¦172913,
\v 10 and Israel's king¦172918 \add ≈complained\add*, “Oh \add dear\add*, \add ≈it seems that\add* Yahweh \add ≈has sent in us\add* three¦172925 kings¦172927 to \add ≈allow Moab to defeat us\add*.”
\v 11 \add ≈But¦172935\add* Yehoshafat¦172936 \add ≈asked\add*, “Isn't there¦172937 one of Yahweh's prophets here, so we might inquire¦172941 from Yahweh through¦172945 him¦172945?”
\p “There's Elisha,” one of the servants¦172948 of Israel's king¦172949 answered¦172946, “Shafat's son, \add the prophet\add* who \add ≈was Eliyyah's assistant\add*.”
\p
\v 12 “\add Yes,\add* \add ≈he receives Yahweh's messages\add*,” said¦172967 Yehoshafat¦172968.
\p So¦172967 the kings of Israel¦172977, Yehudah, and Edom, went¦172974 to see him.
\v 13 \add ≈But¦172982\add* Elisha \add ≈asked\add* Israel's king, “What \add ≈do you and me have in common\add*? Go \add and inquire from\add* your father's prophets and your mother's¦173000 prophets.”
\p “No,” the king of Israel said. “\add We came\add* because Yahweh has called for \add ≈us\add* three¦173010 kings¦173011 to \add ≈allow us to be defeated by\add* Moab.”
\p
\v 14 “\add ≈As army commander Yahweh lives\add*,” Elisha \add ≈responded¦173019\add*, “\add ≈the one who I serve\add*, I wouldn't \add ≈be talking to you or even face¦173030 you, if I hadn't recognised\add* King Yehoshafat of Yehudah.
\v 15 \add ≈So¦173045 now\add* bring me a \add ≈musician\add*.
\p Then¦173045 while¦173051 the musician played¦173051, Yahweh¦173057 \add ≈spoke to him\add*
\v 16 and he said¦173059, “Yahweh says¦173061 that this valley \add ≈will store lots of water\add*\f + \fr 3:16 \ft It's not really clear if he's saying that Yahweh will fill natural pools in the valley with water, or if he's instructing the armies to dig trenches or scrape pools that Yahweh will then fill with water.\f*
\v 17 \add *He\add* says¦173074 that you all won't see any wind¦173079 or rain, \add ≈yet\add* this valley will be filled¦173086 with water¦173087, and you and your animals¦173091 \add will have plenty\add* to drink¦173088.
\v 18 \add ≈That's a piece of cake\add* for Yahweh. \add ≈What's more, he'll give you¦173101 victory over\add* Moab.
\v 19 You'll all \add ≈attack¦173103 every¦173104 important city, including their fortified¦173107 ones\add*. You can chop down their fruit trees, block up their springs¦173119, and ruin their good land with stones¦173127.”
\p
\v 20 \add ≈The next day at the time¦173131 of the morning¦173130\add* sacrifice¦173132, \add ≈to their amazement\add* there was water flowing from Edom and covering the ground.
\p
\v 21 \add By then\add*, \add ≈the people of\add* Moab¦173147 had heard¦173148 that the kings¦173152 had come¦173151 to battle them, \add ≈so\add* they summoned¦173155 \add ≈everyone who could wear a sword and stationed them\add* beside the border¦173163.
\v 22 \add ≈But¦173165\add* when they got up early¦173165 the next morning¦173166 and the sun¦173167 rose, from \add ≈the direction where they were, the water appeared to be\add* red like blood¦173179.
\v 23 “That's blood¦173182,” they \add ≈exclaimed\add*. “Those \add three\add* kings¦173186 \add ≈must have turned against each other and killed¦173187 each other. So¦173181 let's go, Moab, and collect the spoil¦173193\add*.”
\p
\v 24 \add ≈But¦173196\add* when they reached the \add ≈allied\add* camp, the \add ≈allies attacked\add* and they fled \add ≈away\add*. Then¦173196 the \add ≈allies entered Moab and attacked there\add*.
\v 25 They tore down the cities¦173218, and \add ≈each person threw¦173224 a stone onto the good land, making it useless\add*. They \add ≈blocked up\add* every spring¦173231, and they \add ≈chopped down\add* every good tree. \add Eventually,\add* only \add their capital city of\add* Kir-Hareset remained standing \add ≈with its stone walls, but they attacked¦173249 that as well using slingshots¦173248\add*.
\p
\v 26 \add ≈When\add* Moab's king saw that the \add ≈attackers\add* were stronger¦173256 than them, he took a team of seven¦173261 hundred¦173263 swordsmen¦173266 to try to break¦173267 through¦173267 to the king of Edom, \add ≈but they failed\add*.
\v 27 \add ≈So¦173275\add* he took¦173275 his oldest son (who would have become the next king) and sacrificed him \add publicly on top of the city\add* wall. \add ≈This¦173276 made their¦173299 people crazy furious\add* against¦173297 Israel¦173295, so they left and returned¦173298 home.

\v 2 “\add Hmmh,\add* what could I do to help you?” Elisha \add ≈responded¦173335\add*. “Tell me, what have you got in your house?”
\p “Your servant's¦173353 got nothing in the house except a flask of oil,” she \add ≈replied\add*.
\p
\v 3 He told her, “Go \add and\add* ask¦173364 for empty¦173378 containers from all of your¦173374 neighbors¦173374. \add ≈Make sure you get plenty of them\add*.
\v 4 Then¦173383 go¦173383 and shut the door¦173385 behind you and your sons¦173389, and pour oil into all those containers. \add ≈Once each one's full, set it\add* aside¦173397.”
\v 5 \add ≈So¦173399\add* she went¦173399 and she shut the door¦173402 \add of her house\add* \add ≈with her and her sons inside\add*. They would bring¦173407 \add the empty containers\add* to her, and she poured \add the oil\add*.
\v 6 \add ≈Eventually when she told one of her sons to bring¦173421 the next container, he told her that there¦173427 wasn't any more, and at that point, the oil stopped¦173430 flowing\add*.
\p
\v 7 Then she went¦173433 and informed the man¦173435 of God¦173436, and he told her, “Go \add and\add* sell the oil and pay off your debt. Then you and your sons¦173449 can live¦173451 on the rest.”

\v 8 \add ≈One\add* day¦173456, Elisha went to Shunem¦173461, and there was a \add ≈wealthy\add*woman there who \add ≈invited him in for a meal\add*. \add ≈After that, he dropped in there for a meal whenever he was going past\add*,
\v 9 and the woman said to her husband¦173483, “\add ≈You know, I'm sure that this man who often drops in on us\add* is a holy man of God¦173490.
\v 10 Please, \add ≈can we make a small¦173503 upstairs¦173500 room on our flat roof\add*, and we could put a bed and a lampstand in it for him, plus a table¦173508 and chair¦173509 . \add ≈Then whenever he's passing through here, he'll have his own spot to stay\add*.”
\p
\v 11 \add ≈Another\add* day¦173518 when Elisha arrived, he went¦173521 up to his room and lay down.
\v 12 Then¦173529 he told his servant¦173533 Gehazi¦173532 to call the Shunammite¦173535 \add woman\add*, \add ≈so\add* he called¦173537 her and she \add came and\add* stood¦173540 in front of \add @Elisha\add*.
\v 13 He told \add @Gehazi\add*, “Now tell her \add ≈that we've noticed how she looks after us, and ask her what we can do for her? Can we\add* speak¦173563 to the king¦173568 for her or to the captain of the army?”
\p \add ≈But¦173543\add* she \add ≈replied\add*, “\add ≈I have family and friends all around me\add*.”
\p
\v 14 \add After she'd left again,\add* he¦173592 asked \add Gehazi¦173585\add*, “\add Well\add*, what can I do for her?”
\p “\add Hmmh,\add*,” Gehazi \add ≈replied\add*. “She doesn't have a son, and her husband¦173591 is old.”
\p
\v 15 “Call her then,” Elisha said¦173594. \add ≈So¦173594\add* he called¦173598 her and she came and stood¦173601 in the doorway¦173602,
\v 16 and¦173613 \add @Elisha\add* told her, “\add ≈In due course after the normal months\add*, you'll have a son to hold.”
\p “No, my master¦173616, man¦173617 of God¦173618,” she \add ≈stammered\add*. “Don't lie to your¦173622 female servant¦173622.”
\p
\v 17 Then¦173624 the woman¦173625 became pregnant¦173624 and gave birth¦173626 to a son after the normal time, just as Elisha¦173630 had told her.
\p
\v 18 The child¦173639 grew up and \add ≈one day¦173641\add* he went¦173642 out to his father¦173645 who was with the harvesters,
\v 19 and he \add ≈called\add* to his father, “My head, my head.”
\p \add @His father\add* told one of the servants¦173660, “Carry him \add home\add* to his mother¦173664.”
\p
\v 20 \add ≈So¦173666\add* \add @the servant\add* \add ≈carried¦173666 him back\add* to his mother¦173670, and he sat¦173671 on her knees until¦173675 noon when he died¦173678.
\v 21 \add @His mother\add* \add ≈carried him\add* up and laid him on the bed of the man¦173685 of God¦173686, \add ≈shutting the door behind¦173688 her as\add* she went out.
\v 22 Then¦173691 she called¦173691 her husband¦173694 and told \add >him\add*, “Please send one of the young men and one of the donkeys¦173704 to me \add ≈so I can run and see\add* the man of God¦173709 and \add ≈then come back\add*.”
\v 23 “Why are you¦173714 going¦173716 there today?” he \add ≈asked\add*. “It's not a \add ≈religious holiday\add*.”
\p “\add ≈It'll be okay\add*,” she \add ≈answered\add*,
\v 24 and she saddled¦173728 the donkey¦173729, and told the young man, “\add Now, let's\add* go¦173735! You lead and don't¦173736 \add ≈slacken off for my comfort\add* unless I tell you to.”
\v 25 So¦173748 \add #they\add* \add ≈set off to see\add* out the man of God¦173753 at Mt. Carmel¦173757.
\p When \add @Elisha\add* saw her \add coming\add* from a distance¦173764, he told Gehazi, “Look, there's¦173770 the Shunammite woman.
\v 26 Now, please¦173777, run¦173775 to meet her and \add ≈ask¦173779\add* her, ‘Are you all right? Is your husband¦173785 all right? Is your child¦173787 all right?’ ”
\p “\add ≈Everything's all right\add*,” she \add ≈answered\add*.
\v 27 Then¦173791 she got to the mountain¦173798 and to the man of God, and she \add knelt and\add* grabbed his feet¦173800. Gehazi¦173802 came over to push her away, \add ≈but\add* the man of God said, “Leave her because \add ≈she's upset\add*, but Yahweh has hidden¦173817 \add @the problem\add* from me—he hasn't informed me.”
\p
\v 28 “Did I ask¦173824 for a son from \add you¦173831\add*, my master¦173827?” she said¦173823. “\add No, but\add* didn't I say¦173829, ‘Don't \add ≈mislead me\add*?’ ”
\v 29 Then¦173834 he told Gehazi¦173835, “\add ≈Tuck in your robe\add* and take¦173838 my staff in your hand¦173840, and go¦173841 \add quickly\add*. If you \add ≈meet anyone\add*, \add just keeep going and don't stop to\add* bless them, and if someone blesses you, \add don't stop to\add* answer¦173853 them. \add When you get there,\add* lay my staff on the young man's face¦173858.”
\p
\v 30 \add ≈But¦173861\add* the mother¦173862 of the young man said, “By the life of Yahweh and the life of your spirit, I won't leave¦173872 \add without\add* you.” \add ≈So¦173861\add* he got \add ≈ready\add*, and went \add ≈with\add* her.
\v 31 \add ≈However,\add* Gehazi \add ≈had gone ahead\add* and he put the staff¦173883 on the young man's face¦173886, but he didn't \add ≈open his eyes or make a\add* sound¦173889. \add ≈So¦173877\add* he returned¦173892 to meet \add @Elisha\add* and told him that the young man didn't wake up.
\p
\v 32 \add ≈When\add* Elisha reached the house¦173904, \add ≈it was a shock to see\add* the young man lying on his bed, dead¦173907.
\v 33 He went¦173913 in and he shut the door¦173915 behind¦173916 the \add ≈other\add* two, and he prayed¦173918 to Yahweh.
\v 34 Then he \add ≈got on the bed\add*, and he lay on the child and bent down near him, putting his mouth on his mouth, and his eyes on his eyes, and his palms on his palms. Then the child's body¦173945 \add ≈started getting warmer\add*,
\v 35 and he \add ≈got down\add* and walked \add ≈around the room several times\add*. Then¦173948 he \add ≈got on the bed\add* \add again\add*, and bent down near him. The¦173966 young man gasped \add ≈several\add* times, and then opened¦173964 his eyes¦173968.
\v 36 Then¦173970 he called to Gehazi¦173973, and \add ≈told him to call the\add* Shunammite¦173978 woman, and he called her, and she came¦173981 and \add @Elisha\add* told \add >her\add*, “\add ≈Here, take¦173984\add* your son.”
\v 37 Then she came¦173987 in and \add ≈fell to her knees in front of him with her face\add* to the ground¦173993. Then she picked¦173994 up her son and went¦173998 out,

\v 1 \add ≈Now\add* Na'aman \add was\add* the captain in Aram's army. \add He\add* was a \add ≈highly respected by Aram's king¦174134\add*, and was \add ≈promoted to a high position\add* because \add ≈Yahweh¦174141 had helped Aram (Syria) win many battles because of him\add*. \add ≈However, despite his\add* military prowess, \add ≈he suffered from serious skin disease¦174156 called leprosy\add*.\x + \xo 5:1-14: \xt Luk 4:27.\x*
\v 2 \add Previously\add* troops that had been sent out from Aram, had taken a young¦174165 Israeli girl¦174164 captive and she \add ≈had become Na'aman's wife's servant\add*.
\v 3 \add One day\add* she said¦174171 to her mistress¦174174, “\add ≈I wish that my master¦174176 would go and see\add* the prophet¦174178 who \add lives\add* in Samaria¦174180, and then he would \add ≈cure him of\add* his leprosy¦174184.”
\v 4 \add In due course, Na'aman heard\add* and went¦174186 and told \add ≈his master¦174188 what the young Israeli girl¦174193 had said\add*.
\v 5 The king of Aram \add ≈responded¦174198\add*, “\add ≈Ok, I'll write a letter¦174206 to the king of Israel¦174210 for you to take\add*.”

\p
\v 7 \add ≈However\add* when the Israel's king read the letter¦174254, he tore his clothes¦174256 \add in despair\add*, and he said, “\add ≈Do they think that I'm God¦174258 who ends peoples lives and gives life to others? Why's this person\add* sending¦174265 a man \add here for me\add* to take away his skin disease? Surely \add ≈he must be creating a situation so he has an excuse to attack me!\add*”
\p
\v 8 \add ≈Later\add* when Elisha the man of God¦174289 heard¦174284 that Israel's king had torn his clothes, he sent \add ≈a message\add* to the king, “Why did you tear your clothes?

\v 9 \add ≈so\add* Na'aman came¦174317 on his chariots¦174321 and horses¦174319, and he stood¦174322 at the entrance¦174323 to Elisha's house¦174325.

\v 8 \add In those days,\add* the king¦174828 of Aram was fighting¦174831 against Israel¦174832, and he'd instruct his servants, “\add ≈Set up\add* \add #our\add* camp in such and such a place¦174840.”
\v 9 \add ≈However,\add* the man¦174846 of God¦174847 sent¦174845 to Israel's king¦174850 of Israel \add ≈to warn him\add*, “Beware of passing by such and such a place¦174855, because the Aramean \add army\add* \add ≈will be attacking there¦174859\add*.”
\v 10 \add ≈So¦174863\add* the king¦174864 would send messengers to the people at that place¦174868 \add ≈to warn them to watch and be prepared\add*.
\p \add ≈That¦174865 happened several times\add*
\v 11 and the Aramean king \add ≈got very upset about it\add*. He called¦174894 in his servants¦174897 and demanded, “\add ≈Which one of you\add* \add is a traitor—passing military intelligence\add* to the king of Israel¦174908?”
\p
\v 12 “No, my master¦174914 the king,” a servant¦174912 \add ≈answered\add*. “It's the prophet¦174919 Elisha in Israel¦174921 who tells¦174922 their king the things that you say \add even\add* in your¦174930 bedroom.”
\p
\v 13 “Go and find out where¦174936 he is,” he \add instructed\add*, “and I'll send¦174938 some \add men\add* there¦174944 to capture¦174939 him.”
\p “He's in Dothan¦174945,” he was told \add later\add*.
\v 14 \add ≈So¦174947\add* he sent¦174947 chariots¦174951 and horses¦174950 and a large contingent, and they¦174954 \add ≈arrived there¦174949\add* at night¦174955 and surrounded¦174956 the town.
\p
\v 15 Early \add the next morning\add*, the man¦174963 of God's servant got up, and going outside he was \add ≈shocked to see\add* chariots¦174975 and horses¦174974 and an army surrounding¦174970 the town, \add ≈so he called\add* \add @Elisha\add*, “Oh, my master¦174980! What will we do?”
\p
\v 16 “Don't \add ≈be afraid¦174987\add*,” he said¦174984, “because \add ≈we have many more than that on our side\add*.”
\v 17 Then Elisha prayed¦174995, “Yahweh, please¦175001 \add ≈enable\add* his \add ≈sight so he can\add* see.” Then Yahweh \add ≈enabled\add* the eyes of the young man, and he \add ≈was stunned to see\add* that the hill was \add ≈covered with\add* chariots¦175017 of fire and horses¦175016 all around¦175019 Elisha.
\p
\v 18 \add ≈When the Arameans approached to swoop in\add*, Elisha prayed¦175024 to Yahweh, “Please, strike¦175030 \add ≈those warriors\add* with blinding light.” \add ≈So¦175022\add* \add @Yahweh\add* struck¦175039 them with blinding light \add ≈just as Elisha had requested¦175024\add*,
\v 19 and Elisha told them, “This isn't the \add right\add* way¦175049, and this isn't the town. \add ≈Follow\add* me, and let me lead you to the man¦175059 you're looking for.”
\p Then¦175044 he led them to Shomron¦175064 \add (Samaria\add*,
\v 20 and when they'd entered¦175067 \add *the city\add*, Elisha said, “Yahweh, open the eyes of these¦175077 people \add ≈so they can\add* see.” \add ≈So¦175066\add* Yahweh opened¦175079 their¦175083 eyes, and then they \add ≈were stunned to see\add* that they were in the middle¦175086 of Shomron.
\p
\v 21 When he saw them, the king¦175090 of Israel¦175092 \add ≈asked\add* Elish, “Should I \add ≈kill\add* them? Should I \add ≈kill\add* them, my father¦175100?”
\v 22 “\add No,\add* don't¦175103 \add ≈kill\add* them,” he \add ≈replied\add*. “\add ≈Would you cold-bloodedly kill your prisoners of war\add*? \add No,\add* \add ≈give them\add* bread and water¦175113 and \add ≈let them\add* eat¦175115 and drink¦175116, and then they can \add ≈return\add* to their¦175120 master¦175120.”
\v 23 \add ≈So¦175122\add* \add @the king\add* prepared¦175122 a \add ≈large meal\add* for them, and they¦175135 ate and drank, and he sent¦175128 them \add ≈off to return\add* to their master¦175132. \add ≈After that,\add* the Aramean troops didn't continue \add ≈their ventures\add* into Israel¦175141.

\p
\v 24 \add ≈Sometime after¦175145 that,\add* King Ben-Hadad of Aram assembled all of his \add ≈warriors\add* and \add ≈attacked\add* Shomron¦175164 \add (Samaria)\add*, and beseiged it.
\v 25 \add ≈Being¦175169 surrounded like that\add* \add caused\add* a terrible famine¦175167 inside \add *the city\add*, until¦175173 a donkey's¦175177 head would be \add ≈sold for\add* eighty¦175178 silver \add coins\add*, and a \add ≈cup\add* of doves¦175183 droppings was \add ≈sold\add* for five silver \add coins\add*.
\p
\v 26 \add ≈One day as\add* the king of Israel¦175193 was \add ≈walking past\add* past on the \add top of the city\add* wall, a woman¦175198 cried¦175199 out to him, “Save \add me\add*, my master¦175203, the king!”
\p
\v 27 “\add If\add* Yahweh won't save you, \add ≈how could I possibly\add* save you?” he \add ≈snapped\add*. “\add Some grain\add* from the threshing¦175215 floor¦175215 or \add some wine\add* from the winepress?”
\v 28 Then¦175221 he \add ≈asked\add* her, “\add Okay,\add* \add ≈what's your problem\add*?”
\p “This woman¦175229 said to me, ‘\add ≈Let's have\add* your son and we'll eat him today, then we'll eat my son tomorrow¦175243,’ ” she \add ≈answered\add*.
\v 29 “\add ≈So¦175245\add* we boiled my son and ate¦175249 him, and then the next day¦175252 I said¦175250, ‘\add ≈Hand over\add* your son and we'll eat¦175258 him,’ but she'd hidden¦175259 \add *him\add*.”
\p
\v 30 When he heard¦175265 \add *that\add*, the king¦175266 (standing up on the wall) tore his clothes¦175274, and the people¦175281 could see \add ≈to their astonishment that he was wearing sackcloth¦175283 underneath¦175287\add*,
\v 31 and he said¦175289, “May God¦175295 do that to me and more, if Shafat's son Elisha \add ≈still has his head on him by the end of the day¦175307\add*.”
\p
\v 32 \add ≈Meanwhile,\add* Elisha was sitting \add ≈at home\add*, joined by the \add city\add* elders. \add @The king\add* \add ≈had sent a warrior ahead of him\add*, \add ≈and before¦175318 he'd arrived at the house¦175311\add*, \add @Elisha\add* had told the elders, “\add Well now,\add* \add ≈that son of a murderer¦175334 has sent an assasin to separate me from\add* my head. Listen, when that \add ≈hitman\add* arrives, shut the door and \add ≈lean against\add* \add *it\add*. \add ≈His master¦175352 won't be far\add* behind¦175353 him.”
\v 33 He was still¦175373 talking¦175356 with them, when, \add ≈wow, the warrior was coming¦175360 towards the house\add* \add soon followed by the king who\add* said¦175362, “\add ≈Listen, Yahweh caused this disaster so why should I trust\add* \add *him\add* any longer?”
\c 7
\p
\v 1 “\add ≈Listen to what Yahweh says\add*,” Elisha \add ≈responded¦175376\add*, “Yahweh says that at this time¦175386 tomorrow¦175388, a \add ≈drum\add* of flour¦175391 will be \add ≈sold\add* for a shekel, and two \add ≈drums\add* of barley¦175394 will be \add ≈sold for\add* for a shekel at the \add ≈city\add* gate.”
\p
\v 2 “\add ≈That's impossible\add*,” \add ≈interjected\add* the captain¦175400 \add ≈at the king's side\add*. “Yahweh \add ≈would have to make\add* windows¦175416 in the sky.”
\p “\add Oh, it'll happen¦175418\add*,” the man¦175410 of God¦175411 \add ≈answered\add*, “\add and you'll see¦175423 it with your own eyes¦175424, but you won't get to eat¦175427 any of it\add*.”

\p
\v 3 \add That day,\add* four¦175430 men¦175431 \add who were isolated due to\add* a skin disease¦175433 \add ≈were at the city\add* gate, and they \add ≈asked each other\add*, “Why are we \add just\add* sitting¦175443 here until¦175445 we \add ≈starve\add*?
\v 4 If we \add ≈go into the city, we'll starve to death in there¦175457, but\add* if we sit here, we'll die \add anyway\add*. \add ≈Why don't we go into the Aramean army camp\add*—if they kill us then we'll die, but if they let us live, then we'll live.”
\v 5 \add ≈So¦175479 as it was getting dark\add*, they went¦175486 to go¦175481 into the camp, \add ≈but as\add* they came¦175486 to the edge of \add *it\add*, \add ≈to their surprise there wasn't a person in sight\add*.
\v 6 \add It turned out that\add* the master¦175498 had caused¦175499 the Aramean \add ≈army\add* to hear the sounds of chariots¦175506 and horses¦175508 and a large¦175511 army, \add ≈so\add* they'd said \add ≈to each other that the king of Israel¦175522 must have hired¦175518 the Hittite and Egyptian kings to join together to fight them\add*.
\v 7 \add ≈As a result,\add* they taken off and fled in the twilight¦175536. They'd abandoned¦175537 their tents¦175540 and horses¦175543 and donkeys¦175546—leaving the camp just as it¦175550 was, and fled for their lives¦175554.
\p
\v 8 \add ≈So¦175556\add* those \add four\add* \add ≈men with leprousy approached\add* the edge of the camp and went \add ≈into the first\add* tent, and ate¦175568 and drank¦175569. Then they \add ≈took some\add* gold¦175573 and silver¦175572 and clothes¦175574 out, and they went and hid it. Then they returned¦175577 and went into another¦175582 tent, and \add ≈stole some stuff\add* from that one, and went and hid that.
\v 9 Then¦175588 they said \add ≈to each other\add*, “\add ≈We shouldn't really be doing¦175598 this today\add*. It's a day of good news, but we've been \add ≈keeping it to ourselves\add*. \add If\add* we will wait until¦175608 the light¦175610 of the morning¦175611, \add ≈we'll get punished¦175613 for it\add*, \add ≈so\add* let's go now and inform the king's¦175619 household¦175618.”
\v 10 \add ≈So¦175621\add* they went and called¦175622 out to one of the city¦175626 gatekeepers¦175625, and they informed them, “We went to the Aramean camp, but listen, there \add ≈wasn't anyone there, or any voices¦175640\add*. The horses¦175645 and donkeys¦175647 were still tethered, and the tents¦175649 were left just as they were.”
\p
\v 11 The gatekeepers¦175655 called¦175654 out, and¦175656 \add ≈the news was reported to the palace\add*.
\rem /s1 Israel Plunders the Camp
\v 12 \add ≈Although it was already night-time,\add* the king got up and \add ≈warned\add* his servants¦175667, “\add ≈I'll tell you what's going on here\add*: The Arameans know that we are hungry¦175681, \add ≈so\add* they left their camp to go and hide in the countryside, \add ≈thinking that we'd go out from the city, and then they could capture us and take over\add* the city.”
\p
\v 13 \add ≈But¦175704\add* one of his servants¦175706 answered, “\add Sir,\add* please¦175710, let us take five of the remaining horses¦175714. \add ≈They're pretty much finished anyway, like the remaining\add* population of Israel¦175725, \add so there's not much to lose\add*. Let us \add ≈go and investigate\add*.”
\v 14 \add ≈So¦175741 with the king's permission,\add* they¦175741 took¦175741 two¦175742 chariot¦175743 horses¦175744 and \add ≈went to check out\add* the Aramean camp.”
\v 15 They went¦175755 \add ≈as far as\add* the Yordan¦175759 \add river\add*, and \add ≈were amazed that\add* the whole road was full of clothing¦175765 and equipment¦175766 that the Arameams had thrown¦175769 off in their¦175771 rush, and the messengers¦175774 returned¦175773 and informed the king¦175776.
\v 16 \add ≈So¦175778\add* the people¦175779 went¦175778 out and plundered¦175780 the camp. Then¦175778 it happened:, a \add ≈drum\add* of fine flour¦175787 was \add ≈sold\add* for a shekel, and two \add ≈drums\add* of barley¦175790 \add ≈for the same amount, just a Yahweh had said would happen\add*.
\p
\v 17 The king had appointed¦175796 the captain¦175799 who \add ≈had argued with Elisha to be in charge at\add* the \add city\add* gate, but the people¦175810 trampled¦175809 him \add *there\add* and he died, just as the man of God¦175816 had said when the king \add ≈had gone to his place\add*.
\v 18 When¦175842 the man¦175825 of God¦175826 had told the king¦175829 that two¦175831 \add ≈drums\add* of barley¦175832 \add ≈would be sold\add* for a shekel, and¦175834 a \add ≈drum\add* of flour¦175836 \add ≈also sold for\add* a shekel the next morning at the \add *city\add* gate,
\v 19 the captain¦175845 \add was the one who'd\add* answered¦175844 the man¦175848 of God¦175849 and had said that Yahweh would have to make windows¦175854 in the sky to do that, and \add @Elisha\add* had told him that he'd see it, but wouldn't be able to eat¦175865 any of it.
\v 20 That's¦175872 exactly what happened, \add ≈because\add* he got trampled¦175871 by the \add rush of\add* people¦175873 at the gate and died¦175875.

\v 1 \add ≈One day\add* Elisha spoke¦175879 to the \add Shunammite\add* woman¦175882 whose¦175888 son he'd \add ≈brought back to life¦175885\add*, “\add ≈Pack up and leave here\add*, you and your household¦175894, and \add ≈go¦175891 and stay somewhere else\add*, because Yahweh's \add ≈going to send a seven-year drought\add*.”
\v 2 \add ≈So¦175912\add* the woman¦175913 got up, and she did \add ≈what the man of God¦175917 told her\add*: She \add ≈packed up her household¦175920 and left to go and live\add* in the Philistines' \add ≈region\add* for seven¦175925 years¦175926.
\p
\v 3 \add ≈Then¦175928 eventually after\add* seven¦175930 years¦175931, the woman¦175933 returned¦175932 from the Philistines' \add ≈region\add* and she went¦175936 \add ≈petition\add* the king¦175940 \add ≈about\add* her house¦175943 and land.
\v 4 \add When she arrived,\add* the king \add ≈had asked\add* Gehazi¦175952, the man of God's servant¦175953, “Please tell me all the \add ≈incredible\add* things that Elisha has done.”
\v 5 Then \add @Gehazi\add* was telling the king that \add @Elisha\add* had made the dead live, and how the woman who he made her son live was \add ≈petitioning\add* the king on behalf of her house¦175996 and her field¦175999. Then Gehazi \add ≈exclaimed\add*, “My master¦176002, the king, this is the woman, and that's her son, who Elisha made live!”
\v 6 \add ≈So¦176015\add* the king questioned the woman¦176017 and she told him \add her story\add*. Then¦176015 the king appointed¦176021 a court¦176025 official to \add ≈attend to her case\add*, saying, “Return everything that belongs to her \add ≈plus the profit from her\add* field¦176040 from the day¦176041 she left until now.”

\v 8 The the king¦176073 \add ≈instructed\add* \add an official named\add* Haza'el, “Take a gift¦176079 \add ≈with you¦176078\add* and go¦176080 \add ≈and\add* meet the man¦176082 of God¦176083. Then¦176072 will inquire¦176084 from Yahweh through¦176089 him¦176089 \add ≈to find out if I'll\add* recover¦176091 from this sickness?”
\v 9 \add ≈So¦176095\add* Haza'el went to meet \add @Elisha\add* and \add ≈taking presents with him loaded on\add* forty¦176106 camels¦176107—\add some of\add* every good thing¦176103 \add that he could find\add* in Damascus.

\p
\v 10 “Go \add and\add* tell him that he'll surely live,” Elisha \add ≈answered\add*. “But¦176127 Yahweh has shown¦176137 me that he'll definitely die.”
\v 11 Then¦176144 \add @Elisha\add* \add ≈stared at him until¦176149\add* \add @Haza'el\add* \add ≈felt embarrassed\add*, and then the man¦176153 of God¦176154 started to cry.
\p
\v 12 “Why are you crying, my master¦176159?” Haza'el asked.
\p “Because I know¦176164 what evil things you'll do to the \add ≈Israelis¦176170\add*,” he said. “You'll \add ≈burn down\add* their fortresses¦176172 and kill¦176177 their young¦176175 men¦176175 with the sword¦176176.

\p
\v 13 Haza'el \add ≈asked\add*, “But¦176183 \add ≈how could your¦176187 servant¦176187 \add be in a position to\add* do such a major thing¦176191 when he's only minor, like a\add* dog \add in the palace\add*?”
