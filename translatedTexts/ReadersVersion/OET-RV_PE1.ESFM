\mt2 The first letter from
\mt1 Simon ‘the Rock’ (Peter)
\is1 Introduction
\ip \bk The first letter from Simon ‘Peter’\bk* was written to believers scattered throughout Asia Minor (also called Anatolia, now part of modern Turkey). Peter wrote to encourage the believers that it's necessary for them to be strong even in the middle of much persecution that comes because of their faith in the messiah. He reminds them about their salvation, the death of Yeshua the messiah, and of his coming back to life. Because Peter told them that there must always remember their hope in heaven, then they can persevere even through all the difficulties here on earth. He also reminds them that if their faith holds strong through their suffering of difficulties and persecutions, they will receive a gift at “The time when Yeshua the messiah is revealed.” (1:7,13)
\ip He also warns them that it's necessary to watch their behaviour as followers of the messiah and it's necessary that they follow the guidance of their elders.

\v 1 \add This letter is from\add* Peter, a missionary for \nd Yeshua¦149424\nd* the \nd messiah¦149425\nd*.
\p \add It's written\add* to those who've been chosen \add by God\add* and dispersed¦149429 \add by persecution\add* throughout \add the provinces of\add* Pontus¦149430, Galatia¦149431, Cappadocia¦149432, Asia \add Minor\add* and Bithynia.
\v 2 \add They were \nd chosen¦149449\nd*\add* in advance by God the father¦149439 by his pure \nd spirit¦149442\nd*, thanks to the obedience¦149444 of \nd Yeshua¦149448\nd* the \nd messiah¦149449\nd* and the sprinkling¦149446 of his blood¦149447.
\rem /s1 Praise to God for a Living Hope; The Hope of Eternal Life; Peter gives thanks
\p May \add God give\add* you¦149451 all grace¦149450 and multiplied¦149454 peace¦149453.
\s1 The future hope of life without ending
\p
\v 3 May \nd God¦149457\nd*, the father¦149459 of our¦149462 \nd master¦149461\nd* Yeshua the messiah be blessed. He's the one who, because of his¦149469 incredible mercy¦149470, births us into living¦149477 hope through¦149478 the death and¦149458 coming back to life of Yeshua the messiah.
\v 4 \add Now we have\add* an inheritance¦149485 that can't be destroyed or ruined and never diminishes. It's kept¦149493 in the heavens¦149496 for you¦149500 all
\v 5 who are guarded¦149505 through¦149506 faith¦149507 by God's power¦149503, because¦149508 salvation¦149509 is ready¦149511 to be revealed¦149512 in the final age.
\p
\v 6 \add This salvation\add* brings some happiness now, although offset by the sorrow¦149525 of various¦149529 trials¦149531 \add that you¦149518 all go through\add*
\v 7 in order¦149532 that your faith will be purified by fire, like gold but \add even\add* more precious¦149540 because gold perishes¦149545. Then your faith will lead to praise¦149553 and glory¦149556 and honour¦149560 when \nd Yeshua¦149563\nd* the \nd messiah¦149564\nd* is revealed,
\v 8 the one you all love although you've never seen¦149568 him. Yet you all believe¦149576 and because of that you are more happy than you all can even show AND HAVING BEEN GLORIFIED,
\v 9 you'll receive¦149584 the result of your faith¦149588 which is the salvation¦149590 of your souls¦149591.
\rem /s1 The calling of a Christian
\p
\v 10 The prophets¦149598 wanted that salvation¦149594 and¦149596 searched¦149597 for it, even while speaking about the grace¦149604 which you¦149603 all would experience.
\v 11 They tried to discover which person or what time¦149611 that the messiah's \nd spirit¦149616\nd* within them was telling them, having previously¦149618 testified¦149618 that the messiah would suffer¦149623 but afterwards¦149626 would be GLORIOUS.
\v 12 It was shown to them that they weren't just serving themselves¦149634 but were serving you as they declared¦149642 all the same things that have been preached¦149646 to you all by the holy \nd spirit¦149650\nd* who was sent from heaven. Even \add God's\add* messengers¦149658 in heaven wanted to know more about those things.

\v 13 So¦149660 take this seriously and get your minds prepared, and putting your full hope on the grace¦149674 that will be brought¦149672 to you all by the revelation¦149676 of \nd Yeshua¦149677\nd* the \nd messiah¦149678\nd*.
\v 14 As people who want to obey, don't¦149682 conform¦149683 to your earlier¦149685 desires¦149690 that came from your ignorance¦149688,
\v 15 but¦149691 just as \add God\add* who called¦149694 you¦149695 is holy, your yourselves¦149698 need to be holy in all your conduct¦149702,

\p
\v 17 As since you call on the father¦149719 who impartially¦149723 judges each person according¦149726 to their actions, then continue to obey him even as you all live in foreign lands,
\v 18 knowing¦149740 that when you all were in slavery due to your poor conduct¦149754 that you inherited¦149755 from your ancestors, you weren't bought out of that by payment of perishable¦149743 things like silver¦149745 or gold¦149748,
\v 19 but¦149757 by the precious¦149759 blood¦149760 of the \nd messiah¦149766\nd*—the unblemished¦149763 and¦149764 spotless¦149765 lamb.
\v 20 He had been foreknown¦149768 before¦149771 the creation of the world¦149773, yet he was only revealed¦149774 recently for the sake of all of you
\v 21 who believe¦149789 in God through him. God was the one who raised¦149794 him from the dead¦149798 and honoured him, so that your¦149806 faith¦149805 and hope would be in God.
\p
\v 22 Since your souls¦149814 have been purified¦149816 by obeying the truth¦149821, \add now\add* you should love each other from your hearts¦149829 and without hypocrisy.
\v 23 You've been born again¦149834, not by some physical thing that will perish¦149839, but¦149840 of indestructible¦149841 material—God's message¦149843 that's alive and¦149846 lives on

He's the one who \add deserves\add* the honour and¦151023 the power¦151025 all through the ages.
\s1 The suffering of believers

\v 12 Dear friends, don't¦151034 be surprised¦151035 as the fiery¦151040 trials that you all will have to face as a test, as though¦151045 it's something unusual that's happening¦151048 to you,
\v 13 but rather as you all share in the sufferings¦151055 of the \nd messiah¦151054\nd*, stay positive so that you will all be happy as you're also glad to see his¦151064 honour revealed.
\v 14 You all \add will be\add* blessed¦151072 if you are derided¦151068 in the name¦151070 of the \nd messiah¦151071\nd* because¦151073 God's spirit rests on you all—the spirit that honours \add him\add*.
\v 15 None of you should¦151103 suffer¦151103 \add persecution\add* because you're a murderer¦151105 or a thief¦151109 or a troublemaker or nosey-parker,
\v 16 but if you \add suffer\add* for being¦151125 a follower¦151123 of the messiah¦151123, then there's no need to feel ashamed¦151125 but \add instead\add* be praising \nd God¦151129\nd* in that name¦151132.
\p
\v 17 It's time¦151137 to begin judgement and to begin with God's people, and if we're judged first¦151149, what will the outcome¦151155 be for those who refuse to believe in God's good¦151162 message¦151162?
\v 18 \x + \xo 4:18: \xt Prv 11:31 (LXX).\x*Yes,
\q1 ‘if it's difficult¦151168 for godly people to be saved¦151169,
\q2 what will it be like for the ungodly¦151172 and¦151173 for sinners¦151175.’
\m
\v 19 So for anyone who's suffering¦151183 according¦151184 to God's will, let them entrust¦151192 the well-being of their¦151196 souls¦151194 to the faithful¦151190 creator¦151191.

\p
\v 1 Because of that I am encouraging your elders as a fellow¦151207 elder and witness¦151209 of the sufferings¦151214 of the \nd messiah¦151213\nd* and also a partner¦151223 in the GLORY that's going¦151218 to be revealed¦151219:
\v 2 \x + \xo 5:2: \xt Jn 21:15-17.\x*Carefully shepherd¦151224 God's people that you¦151227 care for, not out of compulsion¦151233 but willingly¦151235, listening to God, not greedily¦151240 but enthusiastically,
\v 3 not exercising¦151245 dominance over them, but¦151248 being examples¦151249 for them.
\v 4 Then when the chief¦151256 shepherd¦151256 \add returns\add*, you¦151257 all will receive¦151257 the unfading¦151259 crown¦151262 of honour.
\p
\v 5 \x + \xo 5:5: \xt Prv 3:34 (LXX).\x*Similarly¦151263, you younger¦151265 ones, take the advice of your elders¦151268, and all of you, show humility¦151275 to each other because¦151277 ‘\nd God¦151279\nd* opposes¦151281 those who're proud¦151280, but¦151283 displays grace¦151285 to those who're humble¦151282.’
\v 6 \x + \xo 5:6: \xt Mat 23:12; Luk 14:11; 18:14.\x*So¦151287 humble¦151286 yourselves under¦151288 God's might hand¦151291 so that he might honour you at the \add right\add* time¦151299.
\v 7 Give all your¦151304 concerns to him because¦151310 he cares about¦151313 you all.
\p
\v 8 Stay alert and keep watch¦151317. Your¦151321 opponent¦151320, the devil¦151323, walks around like a roaring¦151327 lion¦151326, wanting to swallow¦151331 \add you¦151321 all\add* up
\v 9 \add but remain\add* firmly in the faith¦151338 and resist¦151334 him, knowing¦151339 that fellow believers \add all around\add* the world¦151349 experiencing similar sufferings¦151344 are doing the same¦151342.
\v 10 Then \nd God¦151357\nd*, \add the source\add* of all grace¦151359 and the one who called¦151361 you to his¦151367 eternal¦151366 GLORY in the \nd messiah¦151371\nd* will prepare¦151376 you all as you suffer¦151374 a little¦151373, and will then strengthen you as you're established.
\v 11 May his ruling be powerful throughout all the ages. May it¦151397 be so¦151397.
