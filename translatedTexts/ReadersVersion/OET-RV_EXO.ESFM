\s1 The peg-slave of Israel's descendants
\rem /s1 The Israelites Are Treated Cruelly in Egypt; The Israelites Oppressed; The Israelites in Egypt
\p
\v 1 These are the names¦25402 of Yisra'el's descendants who accompanied Yacob (Jacob) when he moved his household¦25410 to Egypt:\x + \xo 1:1-4: \xt Gen 46:8-27.\x*
\v 2 Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Yehudah,
\v 3 Issachar, Zebulun¦25419, Benyamin¦25420,
\v 4 Dan, Naftali¦25424, Gad, and Asher¦25426.
\v 5 \add At that time,\add* Yacob had a total of seventy¦25436 descendants (including Yosef¦25438 \add and¦25438 his sons\add* who were \add already\add* in Egypt.)
\p
\v 6 \add As the years progressed,\add* Yosef¦25443 and his brothers¦25446 died¦25442—all of that generation¦25448,
\v 7 \add but they'd had many children who went on to have their own children and grandchildren,\add* and so they became a large and powerful group \add there in Egypt\add*.\x + \xo 1:7: \xt Acts 7:17.\x*
\rem /s1 The Israelites Are Oppressed
\p
\v 8 \add Eventually\add* a new king¦25465 came to power in Egypt who had never known Yosef¦25477\x + \xo 1:8: \xt Acts 7:18.\x*
\v 9 and he told his people, “Listen, those descendants of Israel are becoming more numerous¦25487 and powerful¦25488 than us.
\v 10 \add So\add*, let's deal wisely¦25492 with them, in case they \add continue to\add* multiply. Then if war was to break out, they could easily take the other side and fight¦25509 against us, and then leave our country.”\x + \xo 1:10: \xt Acts 7:19.\x*
\v 11 Then they appointed¦25517 overseers¦25519 to work them in slave¦25520 gangs¦25520, and using them as forced¦25523 labour¦25523, they built¦25524 the store¦25526 cities¦25525 at Pithon¦25530 and Rameses¦25533 for Far'oh (Pharaoh).
\v 12 \add However,\add* the more they oppressed them, the more they multiplied and spread¦25541 out, and \add the more\add* the Egyptians came¦25542 to dread¦25542 the Israelis.
\v 13 \add So they\add* made the Israelis work \add long, hard hours\add*,
\v 14 and they made their lives¦25558 bitter¦25555 with the hard slavery. \add They were forced to make\add* mortar¦25561 and bricks¦25562, as well as all kinds of slave labour¦25573 in the fields¦25566—all the work they had to do was \add strenuous and tiring\add*.
\p
\v 15 Then the king¦25578 of Egypt spoke to Shiphrah and¦25586 Puah, the two Hebrew¦25581 midwives¦25580,
\v 16 saying, “When you assist the Hebrew¦25594 women as midwives¦25591, \add as you sit there on your\add* stool, if you see¦25595 that it's a male, do \add something\add* so he'll die, but if it's a female, then let her live¦25609.”
\v 17 But the midwives¦25612 \add were godly women\add* and didn't do according to what the Egyptian king¦25621 \add had instructed\add* them, and they¦25617 let the boys live¦25623.
\v 18 \add So\add* the king¦25629 called¦25628 the midwives¦25632 \add back\add*, and he \add demanded\add*, “Why have you done that and let \add their\add* sons live¦25639?”
\p
\v 19 “Because the Hebrew¦25653 women aren't like Egyptian women,” the midwives \add answered\add*. “They're \add more active\add* and give birth¦25662 before¦25658 the midwife \add even\add* gets to them.”
\v 20 \add So\add* God¦25665 rewarded the midwives¦25666, and \add meanwhile,\add* the people¦25668 \add continued to increase in number\add* and become more powerful,
\v 21 and because the midwives¦25676 had \add demonstrated their desire to obey\add* God, he gave them families \add of their own\add*.
\v 22 Then Far'oh commanded¦25684 all of his people¦25688, “You \add all need to\add* toss¦25695 every¦25690 newborn boy into the river, but you can let the girls live¦25699.”\x + \xo 1:22: \xt Acts 7:19.\x*

\s1 The birth of Mosheh (Moses)
\rem /s1 Moses; The Birth of Moses; Birth and Youth of Moses
\p
\v 1 \add During this period,\add* a man¦25703 from the tribe of Levi married a woman who was also a Levite,
\v 2 and she conceived¦25713 and gave¦25715 birth¦25715 to a son. When she saw¦25717 that he was a \add healthy\add* boy, she hid him away for three¦25724 months¦25725,\x + \xo 2:2: \xt Acts 7:20; Heb 11:23.\x*
\v 3 \add but\add* then she wasn't able to hide him any longer. \add So\add* she got a basket made from \add woven\add* reeds and plastered it with bitumen and pitch¦25739. Then she put the baby in it, and floated \add the basket\add* in the reeds along the riverbank,
\v 4 \add leaving the baby's\add* sister¦25753 to watch from a distance¦25754 to see¦25755 what would happen to him.
\p
\v 5 \add After a while,\add* Far'oh's daughter¦25762 came down to the river¦25774 to wash \add herself\add*, and \add she and\add* her young \add attendants¦25769\add* were walking¦25770 along the \add riverbank\add*. She saw¦25775 the container among the reeds¦25780 and sent¦25781 \add one of\add* her slave¦25784 women to get it.
\v 6 She opened¦25787 it and saw¦25788 the baby inside, and wow, he \add started\add* crying¦25795. She felt sorry¦25796 for him and said¦25798, “This baby \add must be\add* one of the Hebrew¦25800 children¦25799.”
\p
\v 7 Then his sister¦25804 \add approached and\add* asked \add the princess\add*, “Would you like me to go¦25810 and find a Hebrew¦25816 woman¦25813 who'll be able to breastfeed the baby for you?”
\p
\v 8 “\add Yes,\add* go¦25829,” answered Far'oh's daughter¦25826, and the girl¦25831 went¦25830 and got the baby's mother¦25835.
\v 9 “Take this baby,” said¦25838 the \add princess\add*, “and breastfeed him for me, and I'll pay you \add for doing it\add*.” \add So\add* the woman¦25856 took¦25855 the baby and \add looked after\add* him.
\v 10 \add When\add* the boy had grown \add enough\add*, she brought¦25863 him \add back\add* to Far'oh's daughter¦25864 and he became her son. She named him ‘Mosheh¦25873’\f + \fr 2:10 \ft More familiar to most English readers as ‘Moses’ from the Greek ‘Μωσῆς’ (Mōsaʸs) but Greek doesn't have an ‘h’ or a ‘sh’ so by going through Greek we ended up with something quite different from his real name. However, English does have those sounds and letters, so there's no reason why we can't get this name correct.\f* \add (which means ‘pulled out’)\add* because she said¦25874 that she'd \add plucked\add* him out of the \add river\add*.\x + \xo 2:10: \xt Acts 7:21.\x*
\s1 Mosheh escapes to Midiyan
\rem /s1 Moses Escapes to Midian; Moses Flees to Midian
\p
\v 11 \add Later on\add* when Mosheh¦25886 was fully grown¦25885, he went out to visit \add the Hebrews\add* and saw their¦25892 \add forced¦25892 labour¦25892\add*, and he saw an Egyptian man beating a Hebrew man—one of his own people.\x + \xo 2:11-14: \xt Acts 7:23-28.\x*
\v 12 \add Mosheh\add* looked¦25902 around to check that no one was watching, then he hit the Egyptian, \add killing him,\add* then he hid his body in the sand.
\v 13 The next day¦25917, he went¦25916 out again and wow, two¦25920 Hebrew men¦25922 were fighting each other, and he said¦25925 to the man in the wrong¦25926, “Why are you hitting your \add fellow Hebrew\add*?”
\p
\v 14 “Who made you the ruler and judge¦25936 over us?” \add the man¦25934 replied\add*. “Are you \add planning\add* to kill¦25938 me like you killed¦25942 \add that\add* Egyptian?” Then Mosheh¦25947 was afraid¦25946 because he realised that what he'd done had \add probably become widely\add* known¦25950.
\v 15 \add Indeed,\add* when Far'oh heard about it, he \add ordered\add* Mosheh to be killed. \add So\add* Mosheh had to flee from \add the king\add* and he \add took off east\add* to live in Midian and he stayed near the well.\x + \xo 2:15: \xt Acts 7:29; Heb 11:27.\x*
\p
\v 16 The priest¦25977 there in Midian had seven¦25979 daughters¦25980, and they would come to the well to draw water out and fill up the troughs¦25986 there so their¦25989 father's¦25989 \add sheep and goats\add* could drink.
\v 17 Now¦25998 some male shepherds¦25992 came along and \add started to\add* shoo their flock¦26000 away, but Mosheh¦25995 got involved and helped them so that their animals could drink.
\v 18 \add When\add* they \add got home\add* to their¦26006 father¦26006 Reuel, he \add asked\add*, “How come¦26010 you¦26009 \add got home\add* so early today?”
\p
\v 19 “There was an Egyptian man¦26014,” they \add answered\add*, “who stood up for us against those \add other\add* shepherds¦26018. And he even drew \add water\add* for us and gave our flock¦26027 water to drink.”
\p
\v 20 “Where is he \add now\add*?” he \add asked them\add*. “What's this—you mean you all just left him there? Go and get him \add so we can give him a meal\add*.”
\p
\v 21 \add Later it turned out that\add* Mosheh was prepared to live with the man¦26050, and¦26051 \add in due course\add* he gave¦26051 his daughter¦26055 Zipporah to Mosheh \add in marriage\add*.
\v 22 \add When\add* she gave¦26058 birth¦26058 to a son, he named him ‘Gershom’ \add (which means ‘foreigner’)\add* because he said¦26066, “I've become¦26068 a foreigner \add living\add* in a foreign¦26070 land.”
\p
\v 23 \add Eventually\add* Egypt's king¦26078 died¦26077, \add but\add* the Israelis groaned¦26080 from the slavery \add they were still under\add* and they cried¦26087 out, and their¦26089 cry¦26089 \add for freedom\add* from slavery went¦26088 up to God.
\v 24 \add He\add* heard their¦26101 groaning¦26101 and remembered¦26102 his agreement with Abraham, with Yitshak, and with Yacob,\x + \xo 2:24: \xt Gen 15:13-14.\x*
\v 25 and he \add looked down on\add* the Israelis and he \add was concerned about them\add*.

\rem /s1 God Calls Moses; Moses at the Burning Bush; Moses and the Burning Bush
\p
\v 1 \add One time\add* Mosheh¦26127 (Moses) was shepherding the flock of his father-in-law¦26134 Yetro (or Jethro, the priest¦26135 at Midian), and he led the flock beyond the wilderness¦26142 and came¦26143 to a hill. (\add This was later known as\add* the mountain¦26146 of God at Horeb¦26148).
\v 2 \add While he was there.\add* Yahweh's¦26152 messenger appeared¦26150 to him in a flame¦26154 coming from the middle of a bush, and as \add Mosheh\add* looked, to his surprise \add he saw that\add* the bush was burning¦26162 in the fire yet not \add actually\add* being burnt up.\x + \xo 3:2-10: \xt Acts 7:30-34.\x*
\v 3 “I've got to go and¦26173 see¦26173 this amazing sight¦26176,” Mosheh¦26169 said¦26168 \add to himself\add*. “How come the bush isn't burning¦26182 up?”
\p
\v 4 When Yahweh¦26186 saw¦26185 that he'd left his path in order to look, God¦26192 called¦26190 to him from the middle of the bush, “Moses, Moses.”
\p “I'm here,” he \add replied\add*.
\p
\v 5 “Don't come any closer,” \add Yahweh\add* said¦26201. “Take off your sandals¦26208 because the place¦26212 where you'e standing¦26215 is HOLY ground¦26217.
\v 6 I'm the God of your father and the God of Abraham, Yitshak, and Yacob.” \add So\add* Mosheh¦26233 covered hid his face because he was scared to look¦26237 at God.
\p
\v 7 “I've certainly noticed the suffering¦26262 of my people¦26249 in Egypt,” Yahweh¦26243 \add continued\add*, “I've heard¦26255 their cries as the \add slave drivers\add* oppress them—I'm unmistakingly aware of their pain.
\v 8 \add So\add* I've come¦26264 down to set them free from Egyptian control and to bring¦26269 them up from \add there\add* to a good¦26277 and wide land—a land flowing¦26282 with milk and honey¦26284. \add It's currently\add* the place¦26287 of the Canaanites¦26288, the Hittites¦26289, the Amorites¦26290, the Perizzites¦26291, the Hivites¦26292, and the Jebusites¦26293.
\v 9 \add Yes,\add* the cry¦26297 of the Israelis has now \add reached\add* me and¦26303 what's more, I've seen¦26305 \add how much\add* the Egyptians are oppressing¦26308 them.
\v 10 \add So\add* go now and I'll send you to Far'oh (Pharaoh) and bring¦26320 my people—Yisra'el's descendants—out from Egypt.”
\p
\v 11 “Who am I, that I should go¦26337 to Far'oh,” Mosheh¦26330 \add asked\add* God, “and¦26341 that I should \add be the one to\add* bring¦26342 out the Israelis out from Egypt?”
\p
\v 12 “I'll certainly be with you,” \add God replied,\add* “and this will be your sign¦26357 \add so that you'll know\add* that I have sent¦26360 you: when you bring the people¦26364 out from Egypt, you all will serve God on this \add very\add* hill.”
\rem /s1 The Divine Name Revealed
\p
\v 13 “\add But listen\add*,” Mosheh¦26375 told God, “\add If\add* I'm about¦26381 to go¦26381 to the Israelis and if I told them, ‘The God of your¦26389 ancestors¦26389 has sent¦26390 me to you¦26391.’ then they'd \add ask¦26392\add* me, ‘\add Oh yeah,\add* what's his name¦26397?’ then what would I tell them?”\x + \xo 3:13: \xt Exo 6:2-3.\x*
\p
\v 14 “I AM WHO I AM,” God¦26403 told Mosheh¦26406. “You'll \add tell them this\add*: ‘I AM sent¦26416 me to you.’ ”\x + \xo 3:14: \xt Rev 1:4,8.\x*
\v 15 Then he \add continued\add*, “This is what you \add need\add* to tell the Israelis: ‘Yahweh¦26432, the God of your ancestors¦26434, the God of Abraham, Yitshak, and Yacob, sent me to you. This is my name forever, and this is my memorial from generation to generation.’
\v 16 Go and gather the Israeli elders¦26456, and tell them, ‘Yahweh¦26460, the God of your ancestors¦26462, appeared¦26463 to me, the God of Abraham, Yitshak, and Yacob, to say, “I've certainly noticed you all and \add how you're all being treated\add* in Egypt,
\v 17 and I've promised¦26479 to take you¦26481 all from your mistreatment in Egypt, away to the land where the Canaanites¦26487, Hittites¦26488, Amorites¦26489, Perizzites¦26490, Hivites¦26491, and the Jebusites¦26492 \add are currently living\add*—to a land flowing¦26496 with milk and honey¦26498.” ’
\p
\v 18 Then \add the people\add* will listen¦26500 to what you tell them, and you and the Israeli elders¦26504 will go to the Egyptian king¦26508 and you'll all tell him, ‘Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews¦26514, has met with us. \add So\add* now, please¦26520 let us go three¦26522 days' journey¦26521 into the wilderness¦26524, so we can sacrifice¦26525 to Yahweh, our God.’
\v 19 \add But\add* I know¦26530 that the Egyptian king¦26536 won't let you¦26535 go¦26538 \add until he's forced to\add*.
\v 20 \add So I will use force\add* and I'll strike¦26547 Egypt with \add several supernatural acts\add*, and after¦26556 those, he'll let you¦26560 all go¦26559.
\p
\v 21 Then I'll \add make\add* the Egyptian \add people¦26566 favour¦26565 you all in such a way that \add* when you go, you \add won't leave empty-handed¦26576\add*.\x + \xo 3:21-22: \xt Exo 12:35-36.\x*
\v 22 \add For example,\add* an \add Israeli\add* woman¦26579 will ask¦26578 her \add Egyptian\add* neighbour¦26580 (or from someone staying \add where she lives¦26581\add*) for gold¦26587 and silver¦26585 items and for clothing¦26588. Then you'll put them on your sons¦26592 and daughters¦26595, and \add in this way\add* you'll all plunder¦26596 the Egyptians.”
