\s1 Israel's descendants are driven into slavery
\rem /s1 The Israelites Are Treated Cruelly in Egypt; The Israelites Oppressed; The Israelites in Egypt
\p
\v 1 These are the names¦25402 of Yisra'el's descendants who accompanied Yacob (Jacob) when he moved his household¦25410 to Egypt¦25406:\x + \xo 1:1-4: \xt Gen 46:8-27.\x*
\v 2 Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Yehudah,
\v 3 Issachar, Zebulun¦25419, Benyamin¦25420,
\v 4 Dan, Naftali¦25424, Gad, and Asher¦25426.
\v 5 \add At that time,\add* Yacob had a total of seventy¦25436 descendants (including Yosef¦25438 \add and¦25438 his sons\add* who were \add already\add* in Egypt.)
\p
\v 6 \add As the years progressed,\add* Yosef¦25443 and his brothers¦25446 died¦25442—all of that generation¦25448,
\v 7 \add but they'd had many children who went on to have their own children and grandchildren,\add* and so they became a large and powerful group \add there in Egypt\add*.\x + \xo 1:7: \xt Acts 7:17.\x*
\rem /s1 The Israelites Are Oppressed
\p
\v 8 \add Eventually\add* a new king¦25465 came to power in Egypt who had never known Yosef¦25477\x + \xo 1:8: \xt Acts 7:18.\x*
\v 9 and he told his people, “Listen, those descendants of Israel are becoming more numerous¦25487 and powerful¦25488 than us.
\v 10 \add So\add*, let's deal wisely¦25492 with them, in case they \add continue to\add* multiply. Then if war was to break out, they could easily take the other side and fight¦25509 against us, and then leave our country.”\x + \xo 1:10: \xt Acts 7:19.\x*
\v 11 Then they appointed¦25517 overseers¦25519 to work them in slave¦25520 gangs¦25520, and using them as forced¦25523 labour¦25523, they built¦25524 the store¦25526 cities¦25525 at Pithon¦25530 and Rameses¦25533 for Far'oh¦25527 (Pharaoh).
\v 12 \add However,\add* the more they oppressed them, the more they multiplied and spread¦25541 out, and \add the more\add* the Egyptians came¦25542 to dread¦25542 the Israelis¦25545.
\v 13 \add So they\add* made the Israelis¦25552 work \add long, hard hours\add*,
\v 14 and they made their lives¦25558 bitter¦25555 with the hard slavery. \add They were forced to make\add* mortar¦25561 and bricks¦25562, as well as all kinds of slave labour¦25573 in the fields¦25566—all the work they had to do was \add strenuous and tiring\add*.
\p
\v 15 Then the king¦25578 of Egypt spoke to Shiphrah and¦25586 Puah, the two Hebrew¦25581 midwives¦25580,
\v 16 saying, “When you assist the Hebrew¦25594 women as midwives¦25591, \add as you sit there on your\add* stool, if you see¦25595 that it's a male, do \add something\add* so he'll die, but if it's a female, then let her live¦25609.”
\v 17 But the midwives¦25612 \add were godly women\add* and didn't do according to what the Egyptian king¦25621 \add had instructed\add* them, and they¦25617 let the boys live¦25623.
\v 18 \add So\add* the king¦25629 called¦25628 the midwives¦25632 \add back\add*, and he \add demanded\add*, “Why have you done that and let \add their\add* sons live¦25639?”
\p
\v 19 “Because the Hebrew¦25653 women aren't like Egyptian women,” the midwives \add answered\add*. “They're \add more active\add* and give birth¦25662 before¦25658 the midwife \add even\add* gets to them.”
\v 20 \add So\add* God¦25665 rewarded the midwives¦25666, and \add meanwhile,\add* the people¦25668 \add continued to increase in number\add* and become more powerful,
\v 21 and because the midwives¦25676 had \add demonstrated their desire to obey\add* God, he gave them families \add of their own\add*.
\v 22 Then Far'oh¦25685 commanded¦25684 all of his people¦25688, “You \add all need to\add* toss¦25695 every¦25690 newborn boy into the river, but you can let the girls live¦25699.”\x + \xo 1:22: \xt Acts 7:19.\x*

\s1 The birth of Mosheh (Moses)
\rem /s1 Moses; The Birth of Moses; Birth and Youth of Moses
\p
\v 1 \add During this period,\add* a man¦25703 from the tribe of Levi married a woman who was also a Levite,
\v 2 and she conceived¦25713 and gave¦25715 birth¦25715 to a son. When she saw¦25717 that he was a \add healthy\add* boy, she hid him away for three¦25724 months¦25725,\x + \xo 2:2: \xt Acts 7:20; Heb 11:23.\x*
\v 3 \add but\add* then she wasn't able to hide him any longer. \add So\add* she got a basket made from \add woven\add* reeds and plastered it with bitumen and pitch¦25739. Then she put the baby in it, and floated \add the basket\add* in the reeds along the riverbank,
\v 4 \add leaving the baby's\add* sister¦25753 to watch from a distance¦25754 to see¦25755 what would happen to him.
\p
\v 5 \add After a while,\add* Far'oh's daughter¦25762 came down to the river¦25774 to wash \add herself\add*, and \add she and\add* her young \add attendants¦25769\add* were walking¦25770 along the \add riverbank\add*. She saw¦25775 the container among the reeds¦25780 and sent¦25781 \add one of\add* her slave¦25784 women to get it.
\v 6 She opened¦25787 it and saw¦25788 the baby inside, and wow, he \add started\add* crying¦25795. She felt sorry¦25796 for him and said¦25798, “This baby \add must be\add* one of the Hebrew¦25800 children¦25799.”
\p
\v 7 Then his sister¦25804 \add approached and\add* asked \add the princess\add*, “Would you like me to go¦25810 and find a Hebrew¦25816 woman¦25813 who'll be able to breastfeed the baby for you?”
\p
\v 8 “\add Yes,\add* go¦25829,” answered Far'oh's daughter¦25826, and the girl¦25831 went¦25830 and got the baby's mother¦25835.
\v 9 “Take this baby,” said¦25838 the \add princess\add*, “and breastfeed him for me, and I'll pay you \add for doing it\add*.” \add So\add* the woman¦25856 took¦25855 the baby and \add looked after\add* him.
\v 10 \add When\add* the boy had grown \add enough\add*, she brought¦25863 him \add back\add* to Far'oh's daughter¦25864 and he became her son. She named him ‘Mosheh¦25873’\f + \fr 2:10 \ft More familiar to most English readers as ‘Moses’ from the Greek ‘Μωσῆς’ (Mōsaʸs) but Greek doesn't have an ‘h’ or a ‘sh’ so by going through Greek we ended up with something quite different from his real name. However, English does have those sounds and letters, so there's no reason why we can't get this name correct.\f* \add (which means ‘pulled out’)\add* because she said¦25874 that she'd \add plucked\add* him out of the \add river\add*.\x + \xo 2:10: \xt Acts 7:21.\x*
\s1 Mosheh escapes to Midiyan
\rem /s1 Moses Escapes to Midian; Moses Flees to Midian
\p
\v 11 \add Later on\add* when Mosheh¦25886 was fully grown¦25885, he went out to visit \add the Hebrews\add* and saw their¦25892 \add forced¦25892 labour¦25892\add*, and he saw an Egyptian man beating a Hebrew man—one of his own people.\x + \xo 2:11-14: \xt Acts 7:23-28.\x*
\v 12 \add Mosheh\add* looked¦25902 around to check that no one was watching, then he hit the Egyptian, \add killing him,\add* then he hid his body in the sand.
\v 13 The next day¦25917, he went¦25916 out again and wow, two¦25920 Hebrew men¦25922 were fighting each other, and he said¦25925 to the man in the wrong¦25926, “Why are you hitting your \add fellow Hebrew\add*?”
\p
\v 14 “Who made you the ruler and judge¦25936 over us?” \add the man¦25934 replied\add*. “Are you \add planning\add* to kill¦25938 me like you killed¦25942 \add that\add* Egyptian?” Then Mosheh¦25947 was afraid¦25946 because he realised that what he'd done had \add probably become widely\add* known¦25950.
\v 15 \add Indeed,\add* when Far'oh¦25954 heard about it, he \add ordered\add* Mosheh to be killed. \add So\add* Mosheh had to flee from \add the king\add* and he \add took off east\add* to live in Midian¦25971 and he stayed near the well.\x + \xo 2:15: \xt Acts 7:29; Heb 11:27.\x*
\p
\v 16 The¦25984 priest¦25977 there in Midian¦25978 had seven¦25979 daughters¦25980, and they would come to the well to draw water out and fill up the troughs¦25986 there so their¦25989 father's¦25989 \add sheep and goats\add* could drink.
\v 17 Now¦25998 some male shepherds¦25992 came along and \add started to\add* shoo their flock¦26000 away, but Mosheh¦25995 got involved and helped them so that their animals could drink.
\v 18 \add When\add* they \add got home\add* to their¦26006 father¦26006 Reuel, he \add asked\add*, “How come¦26010 you¦26009 \add got home\add* so early today?”
\p
\v 19 “There was an Egyptian man¦26014,” they \add answered\add*, “who stood up for us against those \add other\add* shepherds¦26018. And he even drew \add water\add* for us and gave our flock¦26027 water to drink.”
\p
\v 20 “Where is he \add now\add*?” he \add asked them\add*. “What's this—you mean you all just left him there? Go and get him \add so we can give him a meal\add*.”
\p
\v 21 \add Later it turned out that\add* Mosheh was prepared to live with the man¦26050, and¦26051 \add in due course\add* he gave¦26051 his daughter¦26055 Zipporah to Mosheh \add in marriage\add*.
\v 22 \add When\add* she gave¦26058 birth¦26058 to a son, he named him ‘Gershom’ \add (which means ‘foreigner’)\add* because he said¦26066, “I've become¦26068 a foreigner \add living\add* in a foreign¦26070 land.”
\p
\v 23 \add Eventually\add* Egypt's king¦26078 died¦26077, \add but\add* the Israelis¦26083 groaned¦26080 from the slavery \add they were still under\add* and they cried¦26087 out, and their¦26089 cry¦26089 \add for freedom\add* from slavery went¦26088 up to God.
\v 24 \add He\add* heard their¦26101 groaning¦26101 and remembered¦26102 his agreement with Abraham, with Yitshak, and with Yacob,\x + \xo 2:24: \xt Gen 15:13-14.\x*
\v 25 and he \add looked down on\add* the Israelis¦26122 and he \add was concerned about them\add*.

\rem /s1 God Calls Moses; Moses at the Burning Bush; Moses and the Burning Bush
\p
\v 1 \add One time\add* Mosheh¦26127 (Moses) was shepherding the flock of his father-in-law¦26134 Yetro (or Jethro, the priest¦26135 at Midian¦26136), and he led the flock beyond the wilderness¦26142 and came¦26143 to a hill. (\add This was later known as\add* the mountain¦26146 of God at Horeb¦26148).
\v 2 \add While he was there.\add* Yahweh's¦26152 messenger appeared¦26150 to him in a flame¦26154 coming from the middle of a bush, and as \add Mosheh\add* looked, to his surprise \add he saw that\add* the bush was burning¦26162 in the fire yet not \add actually\add* being burnt up.\x + \xo 3:2-10: \xt Acts 7:30-34.\x*
\v 3 “I've got to go and¦26173 see¦26173 this amazing sight¦26176,” Mosheh¦26169 said¦26168 \add to himself\add*. “How come the bush isn't burning¦26182 up?”
\p
\v 4 When Yahweh¦26186 saw¦26185 that he'd left his path in order to look, God¦26192 called¦26190 to him from the middle of the bush, “Mosheh, Mosheh.”
\p “I'm here,” he \add replied\add*.
\p
\v 5 “Don't come any closer,” \add Yahweh\add* said¦26201. “Take off your sandals¦26208 because the place¦26212 where you'e standing¦26215 is HOLY ground¦26217.
\v 6 I'm the God of your father and the God of Abraham, Yitshak, and Yacob.” \add So\add* Mosheh¦26233 covered hid his face because he was scared to look¦26237 at God.
\p
\v 7 “I've certainly noticed the suffering¦26262 of my people¦26249 in Egypt¦26251,” Yahweh¦26243 \add continued\add*, “I've heard¦26255 their cries as the \add slave drivers\add* oppress them—I'm unmistakingly aware of their pain.
\v 8 \add So\add* I've come¦26264 down to set them free from Egyptian control and to bring¦26269 them up from \add there\add* to a good¦26277 and wide land—a land flowing¦26282 with milk and honey¦26284. \add It's currently\add* the place¦26287 of the Canaanites¦26288, the Hittites¦26289, the Amorites¦26290, the Perizzites¦26291, the Hivites¦26292, and the Jebusites¦26293.
\v 9 \add Yes,\add* the cry¦26297 of the Israelis¦26300 has now \add reached\add* me and¦26303 what's more, I've seen¦26305 \add how much\add* the Egyptians are oppressing¦26308 them.
\v 10 \add So\add* go now and I'll send you to Far'oh¦26319 (Pharaoh) and bring¦26320 my people—Yisra'el's descendants—out from Egypt.”
\p
\v 11 “Who am I, that I should go¦26337 to Far'oh¦26340,” Mosheh¦26330 \add asked\add* God, “and¦26341 that I should \add be the one to\add* bring¦26342 out the Israelis¦26346 out from Egypt?”
\p
\v 12 “I'll certainly be with you,” \add God replied,\add* “and this will be your sign¦26357 \add so that you'll know\add* that I have sent¦26360 you: when you bring the people¦26364 out from Egypt, you all will serve God on this \add very\add* hill.”
\rem /s1 The Divine Name Revealed
\p
\v 13 “\add But listen\add*,” Mosheh¦26375 told God, “\add If\add* I'm about¦26381 to go¦26381 to the Israelis¦26385 and if I told them, ‘The God of your¦26389 ancestors¦26389 has sent¦26390 me to you¦26391.’ then they'd \add ask¦26392\add* me, ‘\add Oh yeah,\add* what's his name¦26397?’ then what would I tell them?”\x + \xo 3:13: \xt Exo 6:2-3.\x*
\p
\v 14 “I AM WHO I AM,” God¦26403 told Mosheh¦26406. “You'll \add tell them this\add*: ‘I AM sent¦26416 me to you.’ ”\x + \xo 3:14: \xt Rev 1:4,8.\x*
\v 15 Then he \add continued\add*, “This is what you \add need\add* to tell the Israelis¦26431: ‘Yahweh¦26432, the God of your ancestors¦26434, the God of Abraham, Yitshak, and Yacob, sent me to you. This is my name forever, and this is my memorial from generation to generation.’
\v 16 Go and gather the Israeli elders¦26456, and tell them, ‘Yahweh¦26460, the God of your ancestors¦26462, appeared¦26463 to me, the God of Abraham, Yitshak, and Yacob, to say, “I've certainly noticed you all and \add how you're all being treated\add* in Egypt¦26477,
\v 17 and I've promised¦26479 to take you¦26481 all from your mistreatment in Egypt, away to the land where the Canaanites¦26487, Hittites¦26488, Amorites¦26489, Perizzites¦26490, Hivites¦26491, and the Jebusites¦26492 \add are currently living\add*—to a land flowing¦26496 with milk and honey¦26498.” ’
\p
\v 18 Then \add the people\add* will listen¦26500 to what you tell them, and you and the Israeli elders¦26504 will go to the Egyptian king¦26508 and you'll all tell him, ‘Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews¦26514, has met with us. \add So\add* now, please¦26520 let us go three¦26522 days' journey¦26521 into the wilderness¦26524, so we can sacrifice¦26525 to Yahweh, our God.’
\v 19 \add But\add* I know¦26530 that the Egyptian king¦26536 won't let you¦26535 go¦26538 \add until he's forced to\add*.
\v 20 \add So I will use force\add* and I'll strike¦26547 Egypt with \add several supernatural acts\add*, and after¦26556 those, he'll let you¦26560 all go¦26559.

\p
\v 1 “But listen,” Mosheh¦26602 responded, “they won't believe¦26607 me and won't listen to \add what I say\add*, because they'll say, ‘Yahweh¦26618 never showed himself to you.’”
\v 2 “\add Well,\add* what's that in your hand¦26626?” Yahweh¦26622 \add asked\add*.
\p “\add My shepherd's\add* staff¦26628,” he said.
\v 3 “Throw it on the ground,” \add Yahweh\add* said¦26630. \add So Mosheh¦26638\add* he threw¦26633 it onto the ground and it became a snake¦26636, and \add he quickly moved back away from it\add*.
\v 4 “Pick it up by its tail.” Yahweh¦26642 told him. \add So Mosheh¦26645\add* picked it up by the tail and it became a staff¦26655 in his hand \add again\add*.
\v 5 “That's so that they'll believe¦26659 that \add I\add* appeared¦26662 to you¦26663: Yahweh¦26664—the God of their¦26666 ancestors¦26666—the God of Abraham, Yitshak, and¦26671 Yacob.”
\p
\v 6 “\add Now\add* put your hand \add on your chest—\add*inside your robe.” Yahweh¦26675 added. \add So Mosheh did that\add*, and when he pulled it out again¦26677, his hand had gone \add totally\add* white with disease.
\v 7 Then Yahweh said, “\add Now, put\add* your hand \add back in again\add*.” \add So Mosheh did it again,\add* and when he pulled it out, wow, it had \add returned¦26693 to normal\add*.
\v 8 “\add So,\add* if they don't¦26713 believe you, and \add if the first¦26720 miracle doesn't convince them\add*, then they'll believe \add that second¦26724 miracle\add*.
\v 9 And then, even if they don't¦26729 believe those two miracles and \add won't believe what you tell them\add*, then you should take some water from the river and pour it onto the dry land.

\p
\v 10 “Oh my master¦26760,” Mosheh¦26755 \add responded\add*, “I'm not \add very good at speaking to others—I never have been and¦26780 still aren't. I seem to get tongue-tied¦26781 easily\add*.”

\p
\v 14 Then Yahweh¦26830 got angry with Mosheh¦26831 and told him, “Isn't Aharon¦26834 (Aaron) a fellow Levite and your brother¦26835?

\v 1 After that, Mosheh¦27158 and Aharon¦27159 went¦27157 in and said¦27160 to Far'oh¦27163, “This is what Israel's God¦27168 Yahweh¦27167 says¦27166: ‘Let my people¦27173 go¦27170, \add so\add* they can celebrate me \add out\add* in the wilderness¦27176.’ ”

\p
\v 4 “Mosheh¦27227 and¦27228 Aharon¦27228,” the king¦27224 of Egypt¦27225 answered, “why are you¦27229 causing¦27229 the people¦27232 to \add slacken\add* off from their¦27233 tasks? \add Get¦27230 back\add* to your¦27235 \add work\add*.”

\rem /s1 Making Bricks without Straw
\p
\v 6 Then on that \add very same\add* day¦27251, Far'oh¦27250 ordered the people's¦27256 slave masters and¦27257 supervisors,
\v 7 “Don't give¦27264 straw to the people¦27266 to make bricks¦27268 with as \add you've done up till now\add*. They can go and gather¦27273 straw for themselves.
\v 8 But \add keep\add* the \add same\add* quota of bricks¦27280 \add as before\add*—don't¦27288 decrease it because they \add must be\add* idle \add if they have time to say\add*, ‘Let us go—let us sacrifice¦27302 to our God¦27303.’
\v 9 \add Give the men¦27309 more work so they'll be too busy to worry about deceptive words¦27316\add*.”
\p
\v 10 \add So\add* the slave masters and supervisors of the people went out and told \add them all\add*, “\add The king\add* has said that he won't give you any more straw¦27335,

\v 12 So the people¦27351 dispersed throughout all of Egypt¦27355 to gather¦27356 stubble¦27357 for straw¦27358,

\v 14 Then the Israeli foremen¦27374 that Far'oh's slave masters had appointed¦27379 were beaten¦27373 and told, “Why haven't you¦27386 met your¦27387 required¦27387 brick¦27388 making \add quota\add* yesterday or today? \add It's just the same as in the past\add*.”
\p
\v 15 \add So\add* the Israeli foremen¦27399 went¦27398 and¦27402 complained to Far'oh¦27405, “Why are you¦27408 treating your¦27410 servants¦27410 like this?
\v 16 We haven't been given¦27414 any straw and yet they're telling us to keep making bricks¦27416. And see, we your servants get beaten, but it's your people's¦27424 mistake.”
\p
\v 17 “You're all lazy—plain lazy!” \add the king responded\add*. “That's why you're saying¦27434, ‘Let us go¦27435 sacrifice¦27436 to Yahweh.’

\v 4 \add What's more,\add* I made an agreement with them: to give¦27589 them the Canaan¦27594 region—the area which¦27598 they¦27600 had been staying in.
\v 5 \add Furthermore,\add* I've heard¦27606 the complaints from the Israelis¦27611 who have been enslaved by the Egyptians, and¦27616 I have remembered¦27616 my agreement.
\v 6 Therefore, tell the Israelis¦27625, ‘I am Yahweh¦27628 and I will \add help you escape from\add* the \add control\add* of the Egyptians and rescue you from their slavery. I'll buy you out of slavery using my power and by \add punishing the Egyptians for this injustice\add*.
\v 7 I'll take¦27644 you all to be my own people¦27647, and I'll be your God. Then you'll know¦27651 that I am Yahweh¦27654 your God—the one rescuing you all from the Egyptian oppression.

\v 3 The frogs¦28625 will swarm in the river, then they'll climb out and go into your house and in your bedroom and onto your bed. They'll go into your servants' houses and among your people, and in your \add cooking\add* bowls and into your ovens.
\v 4 They'll climb on you and on your people and on all your servants.’ ”
\p
\v 5 Then Yahweh said¦28653 to Mosheh¦28654, “Tell Aharon: Hold your staff out over the canals, the streams, and the pools, and cause the frogs¦28665 to come up onto the land of Egypt.”
\v 6 \add So\add* Aharon reached out his hand over the Egyptian water \add supplies\add* and frogs came up and covered the land of Egypt.
\v 7 \add But\add* the sorcerers did the same with their magic, and they¦28694 \add too\add* brought up frogs¦28687 over the land of Egypt.
\p
\v 8 Then Far'oh¦28701 called for Mosheh and Aharon¦28699, and told \add them\add*, “Ask Yahweh to take the frogs¦28710 away from me and from my people. Then I'll let \add your\add* people go, and they can sacrifice to Yahweh.”
\p
\v 9 Mosheh¦28720 answered, “I'll pray for you and your servants and your people, \add praying that\add* the frogs¦28722 will keep away from you and your homes and only be left in the river. \add And I'll give you the honour of specifying when it'll happen\add*.”
\p
\v 10 “Tomorrow \add morning\add*,” \add the king replied\add*.
\p “Just as you say,” \add Mosheh responded\add*, “so that you'll know that there's no one \add else\add* like our God Yahweh.
\v 11 \add Tomorrow\add* the frogs will leave you and go away from your houses, and from your servants and your people. They'll only be left in the river.”
\v 12 Then Mosheh and Aharon¦28768 left Far'oh and Mosheh called out to Yahweh¦28761 concerning the \add retraction\add* of the frogs that he'd sent against \add the king\add*.
\v 13 \add So\add* Yahweh did what Mosheh had requested and the frogs died off from the houses and the courtyards, and from the fields.
\v 14 \add The¦28822 people\add* collected them into many piles and the \add whole country\add* stank.
\v 15 \add But when\add* Far'oh¦28837 saw that there was \add relief from the frogs\add*, he \add firmed his resolve\add* and didn't listen¦28847 to \add Mosheh and Aharon\add*, just as Yahweh¦28851 had said \add previously\add*.
\s1 Plague 3: Lice
\rem /s1 A Plague of Gnats; The Third Plague: Gnats; The Plague of Gnats
\p
\v 16 Then Yahweh said¦28855 to Mosheh¦28859, “Tell Aharon: Stretch out your staff and strike the dust on the ground, and it will turn into lice\f + \fr 8:16 \ft The Hebrew word ‘כֵּן/כִּנִּם’ (kēn/kinnim) could refer to either lice, gnats, or fleas. However, unlike lice, gnats don't usually \em reside\em* on people and animals (which seems to be implied by the text).\f* all over Egypt.”
\v 17 So Aharon held out his staff and struck the dust \add with it\add*, and \add the dust\add* became lice on the people and on the animals. All over Egypt, the dust turned into lice
\v 18 and the sorcerers tried to do the same with their magic but they were unable to. \add So\add* there¦28923 were lice on people¦28917 and animals
\v 19 and the magicians said to Far'oh, “This is God's finger.” \add But Far'oh was stubborn\add* and he didn't listen to them, just as Yahweh had said \add previously\add*.\x + \xo 8:19: \xt Luk 11:20.\x*
\s1 Plague 4: The swarm

\p
\v 20 Then Yahweh said to Mosheh, “Get up early in the morning and \add when you see Far'oh¦28953\add* coming down to the river, station yourself in front¦28962 of \add him\add* and tell him, ‘Yahweh saw that you \add must\add* let my people go \add so \add* they can serve me.
\v 21 Certainly if you don't release my people immediately, then take note: I'm about to send the swarm\f + \fr 8:21 \ft The Hebrew word ‘עָרֹב’ (ˊārov) probably meaning ‘mixture’ is sometimes translated as ‘swarm’. This plague could have been anything from flies to other insects (hornets or mosquitoes???) all the way to a mixture of wild animals.\f* at you and your servants and at your people and into your houses. The Egyptians' houses will be full of the swarm and even the ground that they're on.
\v 22 \add But when it happens,\add* I'll distinguish the Goshen region where my people live so the swarm won't be there, \add so that you'll be able to see\add* that I'm Yahweh \add and I'm right here\add* in this land.
\v 23 This sign will happen tomorrow and¦29007 \add you'll see how I plan to set my people free\add* from your people.’ ”
\v 24 \add So\add* Yahweh did \add what he'd said¦29015\add* and a heavy swarm came to Far'oh's house and the houses of his servants and all the Egyptians—the country was ruined by the \add arrival\add* of the swarm.
\p
\v 25 Then Far'oh¦29046 called for Mosheh¦29035 and to Aharon and told \add them\add*, “Go and sacrifice¦29061 to the God of you¦29039 all, \add but here in Egypt\add*.”
\p
\v 26 “It wouldn't be right to do that,” Mosheh¦29066 \add replied\add*, “because our sacrifices to Yahweh¦29072 our God \add would be offensive\add* to Egyptians. Listen, if we made sacrifices in front of the Egyptians \add that are repulsive to them\add*, wouldn't they \add throw rocks at us to try to kill us\add*?
\v 27 We need to travel into the wilderness for three days, then we'll sacrifice to our God Yahweh¦29076 \add there\add*, just like he's telling us to.”
\p
\v 28 \add So\add* Far'oh¦29090 \add relented\add*, “I'll let you all go into the wilderness and sacrifice to Yahweh your God—except you definitely can't go very far. \add Now,\add* ask God for me \add for the plague to stop\add*.”
\p
\v 29 “Listen, I'm about to \add leave now\add*,” Mosheh \add responded\add*, “and I'll pray to Yahweh and he'll withdraw the swarm from Far'oh tomorrow, and from his servants and his people. \add But\add* may Far'oh not be dishonest \add again and\add* fail to let our people go to sacrifice to Yahweh.”
\p
\v 30 Then Mosheh left Far'oh and prayed to Yahweh
\v 31 and Yahweh did \add what\add* Mosheh \add asked him\add* and he withdrew the swarm from Far'oh, and from his servants and his people. Not one remained.
\v 32 \add But\add* Far'oh \add changed his mind and remained stubborn and he wouldn't let the Israelis leave\add*.

\v 1 Then Yahweh said to Mosheh¦29108, “Go in to Far'oh¦29112 and tell him: ‘This is what the God¦29119 of the Hebrews¦29120. Yahweh, says: Let my people¦29124 go \add so\add* they can serve me.

\v 4 \add But\add* Yahweh¦29155 will distinguish¦29154 between the livestock of the Israelis and the Egyptians—none of the Israelis' animals will die¦29163.’ ”
\v 5 Then Yahweh \add said when it would happen\add*, “Yahweh will do this \add to Egypt\add* tomorrow¦29174.”
\p
\v 6 \add So\add* the next day¦29187 Yahweh¦29182 did \add what he'd said\add* and all of the livestock of the Egyptians died, yet none at all from the livestock of the Israelis¦29195 died.
\v 7 Far'oh sent \add people to investigate\add*, and wow, not even one of the livestock¦29207 of the Israelis¦29208 had died. \add But\add* Far'oh was strong-willed and wouldn't let the people go.

\v 8 Then Yahweh¦29223 told Mosheh and Aharon¦29229, “Take handfuls of ash out of a furnace, then Mosheh should \add toss it up in the air in front\add* of Far'oh¦29240.
\v 9 It will become a powder over all Egypt and then it will turn into boils¦29256—bursting blisters¦29258—on people and on animals all over Egypt.”

\v 11 Because of the boils, the sorcerers weren't \add even\add* able to stand¦29287 \add there with\add* Mosheh¦29289 because the sorcerers \add suffered with them\add* along with all the Egyptians.

\s1 Plague 7: Hail

\v 14 because this time¦29344, I'm about¦29347 to send¦29347 all my plagues¦29352 to you and your servants, and your people¦29357. \add You'll all be deeply distressed by them\add*, in order that you might know¦29359 that there¦29361 is no \add one else\add* like me in all the world.
\v 15 \add By this time\add*, I could have teached out and struck¦29373 you and your people¦29377 with such a plague¦29378 that you would all have been obliterated from the land.

\v 17 You're still considering yourself¦29401 to be greater than my people¦29402 by failing to release them.
\v 18 \add Now\add* listen: I'm about¦29407 to cause extremely heavy¦29411 hail to rain \add down\add* at this time¦29408 tomorrow¦29409. \add It'll be hail like\add* which¦29413 has never been \add seen before\add* in Egypt¦29418 from the day¦29421 it was founded¦29422 until now.
\v 19 \add So\add* send¦29428 for your livestock¦29432 and everything you own in the country now, and bring¦29429 it in under cover because the hail will come down on every person and animal¦29442 that is found¦29445 in the countryside and not \add sheltering under a roof\add*, and they will die¦29453.’ ”
\v 20 Some of Far'oh's servants¦29465 who believed what Yahweh¦29459 said, quickly brought their slaves and their livestock¦29468 back into their houses¦29471,
\v 21 but those \add people\add* who didn't believe Yahweh¦29481 \add just\add* left their slaves and their animals out in the countryside.
\p
\v 22 “Raise your¦29500 arm up toward the sky,” Yahweh¦29493 told Mosheh¦29496, “and hail \add will strike\add* all over Egypt—on the people and animals and on every plant in the Egyptian countryside.”
\v 23 \add So\add* Mosheh¦29525 lifted his staff¦29528 to the sky, and Yahweh sent thunder¦29534 and hail, and \add lightning caused fires\add* on the land, and \add so\add* Yahweh rained¦29539 hail \add down\add* onto Egypt.
\v 24 There was hail, and \add also\add* fire¦29549 coming \add down\add* in the middle¦29551 of the hail. It was very heavy¦29553, such as had never been in all of Egypt since¦29564 it became a nation¦29566.\x + \xo 9:24: \xt Rev 8:7; 16:21.\x*

\v 26 Only in the Goshen region where¦29601 the Israelis¦29605 were, was there¦29603 no hail.
\p
\v 27 Then Far'oh¦29611 sent¦29610 for Mosheh¦29613 and Aharon¦29614 and told them, “I've sinned¦29617 this time¦29618. Yahweh¦29619 is righteous¦29620, and me and my people¦29622 are guilty.
\v 28 Pray to Yahweh¦29628 \add to stop it,\add* because the thunder¦29631 of God¦29632 and hail are too much. Then I'll release you all—you won't have to remain \add here\add*.”
\p
\v 29 “As I'm leaving the city¦29646,” Mosheh¦29642 \add replied\add*, “I'll spread¦29647 my palms \add out\add* to Yahweh. The thunder¦29654 will stop and the hail won't continue so that you¦29662 \add will be able to see\add* that the earth¦29665 belongs to Yahweh.

\p
\v 31 (\add Now¦29680\add* the flax and the barley were \add flattened by the hail\add* because the barley was \add full grown and starting to fill out\add* and the flax was in bloom.

\p
\v 3 \add So\add* Mosheh¦29799 and Aharon¦29800 went¦29798 in to Far'oh¦29803 and told him, “This is what Yahweh¦29809, God¦29810 of the Hebrews¦29811 says¦29808: \add how long before¦29817 you'll submit to me\add*? Let my people¦29819 go¦29818 \add so\add* they¦29804 can serve me,

\v 5 They'll cover¦29837 the ground so that no one will \add even\add* be able to see it, and they'll devour whatever remains¦29852 after the hail. Plus they'll devour every¦29862 tree¦29864 growing¦29865 in the countryside.
\v 6 They'll fill your houses and the houses of all your servants¦29876 and the houses of all the Egyptians. It'll be nothing like anything which¦29881 your \add parents generation\add* ever saw, nor anything seen by the \add previous generations\add* from the day they came to be on the earth until¦29893 today.” Then \add Mosheh\add* turned¦29896 around and went¦29889 out from Far'oh¦29899 \add with Aharon\add*.
\p
\v 7 Then Far'oh's servants¦29902 \add asked\add* him, “How much longer is this \add going to cause trouble\add* for us? Let the men¦29915 go¦29912 and¦29916 they'll worship¦29916 their¦29920 God¦29920 Yahweh¦29919. Don't you¦29922 understand yet that Egypt \add is being destroyed\add*?”
\p
\v 8 \add So\add* Mosheh¦29930 and Aharon¦29933 were brought¦29927 back to Far'oh¦29936, and he told them, “Go and worship your¦29944 God¦29944 Yahweh¦29943. Who \add are the ones\add* who'll be going¦29947?”

\v 9 “We'll take our children and our old folks,” Mosheh¦29950 \add answered\add*. “We'll go with our sons¦29954 and daughters¦29955, and with our flocks¦29956 and herds¦29957, because the festival¦29960 of Yahweh¦29962 is for \add all of\add* us.”
\p
\v 10 “\add You'd need Yahweh¦29969 with you if I ever\add* let you and your children go¦29972 \add together\add*,” Far'oh \add responded\add*. “You're clearly \add plotting an evil¦29979 trick\add*!
\v 11 \add Well that won't happen!\add* The men¦29988 may go¦29985 and worship¦29989 Yahweh¦29992 since that's what you've been wanting.” Then he drove¦29997 them \add out of the room\add*.

\v 12 Then Yahweh¦30005 told Mosheh¦30008, “Extend your¦30010 hand¦30010 over Egypt¦30014 and let \add the locusts¦30015\add* rise up over the land, and let \add them\add* devour all the plants—everything which the hail had spared.”
\v 13 \add So\add* Mosheh¦30036 stretched¦30035 his staff¦30039 out over Egypt, and Yahweh sent an east wind over the land all that day¦30051 and all night¦30055. Then morning¦30056 came, and the east wind had brought the locusts¦30063.
\v 14 The locusts covered across all the land of Egypt and came to rest everywhere within the \add country's\add* borders. They were extremely numerous—never before¦30078 were there so many locusts, and it'll never be \add repeated again¦30085\add*.\x + \xo 10:14-15: \xt Rev 9:2-3.\x*

\p
\v 16 Far'oh¦30130 quickly summoned Mosheh¦30132 and Aharon¦30133 and said¦30134, “I've sinned¦30135 against your¦30137 God¦30137 Yahweh and against you¦30138.

\v 18 \add Because of that,\add* the Egyptians will know¦32233 that I'm Yahweh¦32238.”
\p
\v 19 Then God's messenger who travelled ahead of the Israelis¦32250, moved and went¦32251 behind them. \add Also\add* the pillar¦32254 of cloud¦32255 moved from in front¦32248 of them and stood¦32257 behind them
\v 20 and \add so\add* it was then between the \add coming\add* Egyptians and the Israelis¦32267. Then the cloud¦32269 became darkness¦32270 \add on the Egyptian side\add*, \add yet it lit up the other side\add*, and no one could approach it all night.
\v 21 Then Mosheh¦32287 stretched¦32286 his arm out over the sea and Yahweh¦32295 sent a strong¦32302 east wind. It blew all night¦32305 and divided¦32311 the sea \add on each side\add* and dried the \add strip of\add* land in the middle.
\v 22 \add So\add* then the Israelis¦32317 entered through the middle¦32318 of the sea¦32319 on dry ground¦32320 with a wall of water¦32321 on each side of them.\x + \xo 14:22: \xt 1Cor 10:1-2; Heb 11:29.\x*
\v 23 \add However,\add* the Egyptians pursued¦32327 after¦32330 them. Every one of Far'oh's horses and chariots¦32334 and his horsemen \add also\add* entered into the middle¦32338 of the sea¦32339.
\v 24 \add By now morning¦32343 was coming\add* and Yahweh¦32345 looked¦32344 down through the pillar¦32350 of fire¦32351 and cloud¦32352, and he caused confusion for the Egyptian army.
\v 25 He caused¦32358 the wheels¦32360 of their¦32361 chariots¦32361 to turn unevenly \add so they became difficult¦32363\add* to drive, and the Egyptians \add complained\add*, “Let's retreat from \add following\add* the Israelis¦32367, because Yahweh¦32370 is fighting¦32371 against Egypt and for them.”
\rem /s1 The Pursuers Drowned
\p
\v 26 \add On the other side,\add* Yahweh¦32377 told Mosheh¦32380, “Stretch your¦32384 arm out over the sea¦32387 and the waters¦32389 will \add flow back\add* onto the Egyptians and onto \add @Far'oh's\add* chariots¦32395 and his horsemen¦32398.”
\v 27 \add So\add* Mosheh¦32401 stretched¦32400 his arm out over the sea, and as the day broke, the sea began to return¦32408 to its normal¦32412 place. The Egyptians \add turned and\add* fled before¦32415 its impact \add but\add* Yahweh¦32417 shook the Egyptians \add off their horses and chariots\add* in the middle¦32421 of the sea.
\v 28 \add So\add* the sea returned¦32424 and covered¦32426 the chariots¦32429 and the horsemen¦32432—even Far'oh's entire army that had entered into the sea after¦32437 \add @the Israelis\add*. Not even one of \add @the pursuers\add* remained¦32441.
\v 29 \add But\add* the Israelis¦32448 had walked¦32449 through the middle¦32451 of the sea¦32452 on dry land with a wall of water¦32453 on each side of them.
\p
\v 30 \add So\add* Yahweh¦32460 saved¦32459 Israel from Egypt's power that day¦32461, and the Israelis saw¦32468 the Egyptians' bodies \add washed up\add* on the shore¦32476.
\v 31 \add All of\add* Israel saw¦32479 the \add ≈incredible power¦32483\add* that Yahweh had used against the Egyptians, and the people¦32490 revered Yahweh, and put their trust in him and his servant¦32497 Mosheh¦32496.

\p
\v 22 Then Mosheh¦32767 lead the Israelis away from the Red Sea and they moved into the wilderness at Shur. They went through the wilderness for three¦32781 days¦32783 and \add finally\add* found¦32787 some water¦32788,

\v 1 Then they left Elim, and all the Israelis¦32898 entered into the wilderness¦32901 at Siyn (between Elim and Sinai) \add ≈around six weeks\add* after¦32915 leaving Egypt,
\v 2 and all the Israelis¦32926 murmured against¦32930 Mosheh¦32929 and Aharon \add there\add* in the wilderness¦32933,
\v 3 saying, “If only \add ≈Yahweh¦32945 had killed us\add* in Egypt, \add where we'd be\add* sitting by a pot of meat eating bread until we're full, because you've brought¦32958 us out into this wilderness¦32962 to \add ≈starve us all to death\add*.”
\p
\v 4 Then Yahweh¦32975 told Mosheh¦32978, “\add Just\add* watch me make food rain down from the sky for you all. Then the people¦32987 will be able to go out every day and gather¦32988 enough for that day so that I can test them: Will they obey my law or not?\x + \xo 16:4: \xt Jn 6:31.\x*

\p
\v 6 \add So\add* Mosheh¦33021 and Aharon told all the Israelis¦33028, “This evening¦33029 you'll all know¦33030 that Yahweh¦33032 was the one who brought¦33033 you out from Egypt¦33036.
\v 7 In the morning¦33038 you'll all see¦33039 Yahweh's greatness as he's heard¦33044 your¦33047 murmurings against \add *him\add*. \add I mean,\add* who are we¦33051 that you'd murmur against \em us\em*?”
\v 8 Then Mosheh¦33059 continued, “So Yahweh wll gives¦33060 you all meat to eat in the evening¦33063 and enough bread¦33066 in the morning¦33067 to make you all full. \add Yes,\add* Yahweh has heard¦33069 your murmurings against him.

\p
\v 9 Then Mosheh¦33091 told Aharon, “Summon everyone¦33101 to come and face¦33104 Yahweh¦33105, because he's heard¦33107 their murmurings.”
\v 10 And so while Aharon spoke to all the Israelis¦33121, they turned toward the wilderness¦33125, and wow, Yahweh's¦33128 \add dazzling brightness\add* appeared¦33129 in the cloud¦33130!
\v 11 Then Yahweh¦33134 told Mosheh¦33137,
\v 12 “I've heard¦33140 the murmurings of the Israelis¦33145. Speak to them saying, ‘In the evenings, you'll all eat meat, and in the mornings¦33153 you'll all be satisfied¦33154 with bread¦33156. Then you'll all know that I'm your God¦33161, Yahweh¦33160.’”
\p
\v 13 And so that evening¦33164, quail¦33166 appeared and covered¦33167 the camp. And in the morning¦33171, \add something like\add* dew was lying all around¦33175 the camp,
\v 14 and when it evaporated, wow, it left behind thin flakes¦33187—thin like frost¦33189 on the ground there in the wilderness¦33185.
\v 15 \add When\add* the Israelis¦33197 saw¦33194 it, \add ≈they asked each other\add*, ‘What is it?’ because they didn't know what it was.
\p And Mosheh¦33212 told them, “It's the food that Yahweh¦33218 has given¦33217 you all to eat.\x + \xo 16:15: \xt 1Cor 10:3.\x*
\v 16 \add ≈These are Yahweh's¦33226 instructions\add*: Gather enough of it according to how many people you're feeding—about two litres per person¦33235 who lives in your tents.”
\p
\v 17 \add So\add* the Israelis¦33245 went ahead and gathered¦33246 it—some collecting a lot, and others, less,
\v 18 \add but\add* when they measured¦33250 it out, those who'd collected a lot didn't have any extra, and those who hadn't gathered so much still had enough to eat—each person had gathered just enough.\x + \xo 16:18: \xt 2Cor 8:15.\x*
\v 19 Then Mosheh¦33265 told them, “Don't save any of it for tomorrow,”
\v 20 \add but some of\add* them didn't take any notice of him and kept it until¦33285 the next morning¦33287. However, by then it was full of maggots and smelt rotten, and Mosheh was very angry¦33291 at them.
\p
\v 21 \add So¦33296 from that day onwards,\add* they gathered¦33295 it every¦33299 morning, depending on how many they were feeding, and then when the sun¦33303 got hot, \add @the rest\add* melted¦33304 \add away\add*.
\v 22 On the \add ≈Friday\add*, they gathered¦33310 twice as much—around \add four litres\add* for each person—and all the leaders of the community came¦33316 and informed Mosheh
\v 23 and he told them, “This is what Yahweh said: Tomorrow is a rest day to be set aside for Yahweh. \add ≈So bake or cook your food, and keep the left-overs overnight to use in\add* the morning¦33355.”\x + \xo 16:23: \xt Exo 20:8-11.\x*
\v 24 \add So¦33358\add* they did what Mosheh¦33364 had told them and kept the left-overs until¦33359 the morning¦33361, and it didn't stink or have any bugs in it.
\v 25 On that Saturday morning, Mosheh¦33374 told them, “Go ahead and eat¦33375 the previously cooked food because today is set aside for Yahweh and so you all won't find any more \add on the ground\add*—
\v 26 you'll gather¦33389 it for six days¦33388 \add each week\add*, but on the Saturday, there won't be any.”
\p
\v 27 \add However,\add* some people¦33404 did go out to collect it, but they couldn't find any,
\v 28 and Yahweh¦33411 said¦33410 to Mosheh¦33414, “For how long will you¦33418 all keep refusing¦33418 to obey my commandments¦33420 and my laws?
\v 29 Listen, Yahweh¦33426 has given¦33427 you the Rest Day, so on the Friday he gives you food for two¦33439 days¦33439. On the Saturday, everyone¦33442 should¦33446 stay where they are—there's no need for anyone¦33447 to go¦33446 outside \add searching\add*.”
\v 30 So the people¦33453 didn't work on the Saturday.
\p
\v 31 The Israelis¦33460 named it ‘manna¦33464’ \add (which sounds like Hebrew ‘What is it?’)\add*. It was white¦33468 like coriander¦33467 seed, and it tasted¦33469 like wafers¦33470 with honey¦33471.\x + \xo 16:31: \xt Num 11:7-8.\x*
\v 32 Then Mosheh¦33474 said¦33473, “This is the procedure that Yahweh¦33479 has commanded¦33478: Keep a full measure of it for preservation for your descendants so that they can see¦33487 the food which I fed you in the wilderness¦33494, when I brought¦33495 you out from Egypt¦33498.”
\v 33 \add So\add* Mosheh¦33501 said¦33500 to Aharon, “Take a jar and fill it with the full two litres of manna¦33514. Place it in front¦33517 of Yahweh¦33518 for preservation for your descendants.”\x + \xo 16:33: \xt Heb 9:4.\x*

\v 7 \add @Mosheh\add* named that place¦33701 \add both\add* ‘Massah’ \add (which means ‘testing’)\add* and ‘Meribah’ \add (which means ‘complaining’)\add*, because of the conflict among the Israelis¦33709 and because of how they¦33711 tested¦33711 of Yahweh by saying, ‘Is Yahweh among us or not?’

\v 3 along with \add #their\add* two¦33907 sons¦33908. One was named ‘Gershom’ \add (which sounds like the Hebrew word for ‘foreigner’)\add* because \add @Mosheh\add* had said¦33914, “I've been a foreigner living in another country.”\x + \xo 18:3: \xt Acts 7:29.\x*
\v 4 \add Their\add* other son's name¦33920 was ‘Eliezer’ \add (which sounds like the Hebrew word that means ‘God helps me’\add*, because Mosheh had said, “God, who my father¦33926 worshipped, has helped me and¦33928 \add ≈stopped the Egyptian king Far'oh¦33930 from killing me\add*.”)
\p
\v 5 \add So now\add* Mosheh's father-in-law¦33934 brought \add @Mosheh's\add* wife and sons¦33936 to the wilderness¦33943 where¦33944 \add #the people\add* were camping \add near\add* the mountain¦33949 of God.
\v 6 \add ≈He had sent a message ahead\add* saying, “I, your father-in-law¦33957 Yetro, am coming¦33959 to you¦33960, as well as your wife¦33961 and \add #your\add* two¦33962 sons¦33963.”
\v 7 \add So\add* Mosheh¦33967 went out to meet his father-in-law¦33969, and he bowed¦33970 down and kissed¦33971 him. They asked¦33974 each other¦33977 about their welfare¦33978, then they went into the tent,
\v 8 and Mosheh¦33983 related to his father-in-law¦33984 all that Yahweh had done to Far'oh¦33991 and to Egypt on account of Israel, all the hardship¦33999 that found them along the way¦34002, and about how Yahweh had rescued them.
\v 9 Yetro \add ≈was very happy to hear about\add* all the good¦34011 \add things\add* that Yahweh¦34015 had done for Israel when he had rescued them out from Egyptian control,
\v 10 and \add *he\add* said¦34022, “Bless Yahweh¦34025, who rescued you¦34028 from \add slavery\add* in Egypt¦34030, and from Far'oh's power.
\v 11 Now I \add ≈can see\add* that Yahweh¦34048 is greater¦34047 than all the \add other\add* gods because of the \add this result after\add* \add @the Egyptians\add* had acted¦34055 proudly against¦34056 \add @you all\add*.”
\v 12 Then Mosheh's father-in-law Yetro made a burnt¦34062 offering¦34062 as well as sacrifices¦34063 to God, and Aharon and all of the Israeli elders¦34069 came¦34065 to eat¦34071 bread with Mosheh's father-in-law \add ≈in God's presence\add*.

\r (Deu. 1:9-18)

\p
\v 13 The following day¦34082, Mosheh sat down to judge¦34085 the people, and the people stood¦34089 around \add *him\add* from morning¦34096 until¦34097 evening¦34099.
\v 14 When \add* *his\add father-in-law noticed everything that he \add personally\add* did for the people, he \add asked\add*, “What's this that you're doing with the people? Why do you sit \add there\add* alone, and all the people position themselves around¦34129 you from morning¦34132 until¦34133 evening¦34135?”
\p
\v 15 “Because¦34140 the people¦34144 come to me to \add ≈find out what God¦34146 wants for them\add*,” Mosheh¦34138 replied to \add @Yetro\add*.
\v 16 “When a \add difficult\add* situation comes up among them, someone comes to me and I make the judgement between a man and his neighbour¦34159. \add In addition,\add* I help them understand the God's statutes¦34163 and laws.”
\p
\v 17 “It's not a good¦34175 \add idea\add* what you're doing¦34179,” said¦34169 Yetro.
\v 18 “You're¦34192 definitely \add on the road to\add* wear yourself out, plus you'll also wear out these people¦34188 who're with you, because the \add responsibility\add* is too heavy¦34194 for you—you can't \add just\add* do it¦34200 alone.
\v 19 Now, listen¦34204 to \add this\add*: I'll advise you and God will be with you. You be before God for the people¦34212, and you should¦34207 bring¦34215 their disputes to God yourself.
\v 20 You should \add also\add* teach them the statutes¦34228 and the laws, and you should \add teach\add* them the way¦34236 they should \add live\add* and the work that they should do.
\v 21 \add But\add* you yourself should search through all the people¦34249 to find capable men who're godly and faithful¦34256, and not \add greedy for\add* dishonest profit. Then appoint \add the best of them\add* to be over a thousand¦34262 \add >households\add*, and then others to be over groups of one hundred¦34264, fifty, and ten \add >households\add*.
\v 22 They'll \add be the ones to\add* judge the people¦34273, except that every serious situation they'll bring¦34282 to you—they'll judge every minor situation themselves. \add Yes,\add* you must lighten this load off yourself, and they'll share the load with you.
\v 23 If¦34297 you do that, and if God¦34303 tells you \add to proceed\add*, then you'll be able to endure¦34305 \add in the long term\add*, plus all of these people¦34309 \add standing around\add* will be able to return to their¦34313 tents peacefully¦34315.”
\p
\v 24 \add So\add* Mosheh¦34318 \add ≈took his father-in-law's¦34320 advice\add* and¦34321 \add ≈implemented all of his suggestions\add*.
\v 25 \add *He\add* chose¦34326 capable men from among all the Israelis, and he appointed them as heads over the people¦34339: leaders of thousands¦34341, leaders of hundreds¦34343, leaders of fifties¦34345, and leaders of tens \add of households\add*.
\v 26 They became the ones who settled most disputes for the people¦34352. They brought the difficult¦34359 cases¦34358 to Mosheh¦34363, \add but\add* they judged each minor situation themselves.

\v 1 The Israelis¦34388 entered the Sinai wilderness¦34394 in the third¦34384 month¦34383 after¦34385 exiting Egypt¦34390.
\v 2 \add After\add* they had departed from Refidim, they had entered the Sinai wilderness and camped there¦34406 \add ≈at the base\add* of the mountain¦34409.
\v 3 Yahweh¦34418 called¦34416 Mosheh¦34411 from the mountain¦34421, so he climbed up and God gave him this message and asked him to pass it on to Yacob's descendants, the Israelis¦34429:
\p
\v 4 “You yourselves saw what I did to the Egyptians—how I carried you on eagles' wings¦34440 and brought¦34442 you all \add here\add* to myself¦34444.
\v 5 And now, if you all carefully¦34449 listen to my \add ≈words\add* and keep¦34452 my agreement, then \add ≈your nation\add* will be my possession¦34458, \add separate\add* from all the \add others\add*, because all the earth¦34467 is mine,\x + \xo 19:5-6: \xt 1Pe 2:9.\x*

\v 7 \add So\add* Mosheh¦34487 descended \add again\add* and summoned the Israeli elders¦34489, then he passed on that message \add just\add* as Yahweh¦34500 had commanded¦34499 him,

\v 11 and be prepared¦34571 for the third day, because on the third day \add *I\add* will come down to Mount¦34586 Sinai while all the people¦34583 watch.

\v 30 If a ransom payment is demanded instead, \add @the owner\add* may buy back \add #their\add* life¦35756 by paying the full amount demanded.
\v 31 Those rules also apply if the bull gores a \add person's\add* son or daughter¦35769.
\v 32 If the ox gores a male or female¦35782 slave, \add @its owner\add* must give thirty¦35785 silver¦35783 shekels¦35786 to the \add slave owner\add* and the bull must be \add ≈killed by throwing rocks at it\add*.
\p
\v 33 If¦35799 \add #someone\add* uncovers a \add pit for storage\add*, or digs a \add new one\add* and leaves it uncovered, and an ox or a donkey¦35811 falls¦35806 into it,
\v 34 the owner of the pit must pay compensation¦35815. \add @The pit owner\add* must pay in cash, \add but\add* the dead¦35819 animal will then belong¦35820 to them.

\v 36 \add But¦35853\add* if it was known¦35852 that the bull had a habit of goring in the past and its owner hadn't kept it \add fenced\add* in, then \add @that owner\add* must certainly¦35862 give a live bull for the dead one, \add but\add* the dead animal will become \add #theirs\add*.
