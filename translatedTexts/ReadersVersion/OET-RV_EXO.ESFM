\s1 Israel's descendants are driven into slavery
\rem /s1 The Israelites Are Treated Cruelly in Egypt; The Israelites Oppressed; The Israelites in Egypt
\p
\v 1 These are the names¦25402 of Yisra'el's descendants who accompanied Yacob (Jacob) when he moved his household¦25410 to Egypt¦25406:\x + \xo 1:1-4: \xt Gen 46:8-27.\x*
\v 2 Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Yehudah,
\v 3 Issachar, Zebulun¦25419, Benyamin¦25420,
\v 4 Dan, Naftali¦25424, Gad, and Asher¦25426.
\v 5 \add At that time,\add* Yacob had a total of seventy¦25436 descendants (including Yosef¦25438 \add and¦25438 his sons\add* who were \add already\add* in Egypt.)
\p
\v 6 \add As the years progressed,\add* Yosef¦25443 and his brothers¦25446 died¦25442—all of that generation¦25448,
\v 7 \add but they'd had many children who went on to have their own children and grandchildren,\add* and so they became a large and powerful group \add there in Egypt\add*.\x + \xo 1:7: \xt Acts 7:17.\x*
\rem /s1 The Israelites Are Oppressed
\p
\v 8 \add Eventually\add* a new king¦25465 came to power in Egypt who had never known Yosef¦25477\x + \xo 1:8: \xt Acts 7:18.\x*
\v 9 and he told his people, “Listen, those descendants of Israel are becoming more numerous¦25487 and powerful¦25488 than us.
\v 10 \add So\add*, let's deal wisely¦25492 with them, in case they \add continue to\add* multiply. Then if war was to break out, they could easily take the other side and fight¦25509 against us, and then leave our country.”\x + \xo 1:10: \xt Acts 7:19.\x*
\v 11 Then they appointed¦25517 overseers¦25519 to work them in slave¦25520 gangs¦25520, and using them as forced¦25523 labour¦25523, they built¦25524 the store¦25526 cities¦25525 at Pithon¦25530 and Rameses¦25533 for Far'oh¦25527 (Pharaoh).
\v 12 \add However,\add* the more they oppressed them, the more they multiplied and spread¦25541 out, and \add the more\add* the Egyptians came¦25542 to dread¦25542 the Israelis¦25545.
\v 13 \add So they\add* made the Israelis¦25552 work \add long, hard hours\add*,
\v 14 and they made their lives¦25558 bitter¦25555 with the hard slavery. \add They were forced to make\add* mortar¦25561 and bricks¦25562, as well as all kinds of slave labour¦25573 in the fields¦25566—all the work they had to do was \add strenuous and tiring\add*.
\p
\v 15 Then the king¦25578 of Egypt spoke to Shiphrah and¦25586 Puah, the two Hebrew¦25581 midwives¦25580,
\v 16 saying, “When you assist the Hebrew¦25594 women as midwives¦25591, \add as you sit there on your\add* stool, if you see¦25595 that it's a male, do \add something\add* so he'll die, but if it's a female, then let her live¦25609.”
\v 17 But the midwives¦25612 \add were godly women\add* and didn't do according to what the Egyptian king¦25621 \add had instructed\add* them, and they¦25617 let the boys live¦25623.
\v 18 \add So\add* the king¦25629 called¦25628 the midwives¦25632 \add back\add*, and he \add demanded\add*, “Why have you done that and let \add their\add* sons live¦25639?”
\p
\v 19 “Because the Hebrew¦25653 women aren't like Egyptian women,” the midwives \add answered\add*. “They're \add more active\add* and give birth¦25662 before¦25658 the midwife \add even\add* gets to them.”
\v 20 \add So\add* God¦25665 rewarded the midwives¦25666, and \add meanwhile,\add* the people¦25668 \add continued to increase in number\add* and become more powerful,
\v 21 and because the midwives¦25676 had \add demonstrated their desire to obey\add* God, he gave them families \add of their own\add*.
\v 22 Then Far'oh¦25685 commanded¦25684 all of his people¦25688, “You \add all need to\add* toss¦25695 every¦25690 newborn boy into the river, but you can let the girls live¦25699.”\x + \xo 1:22: \xt Acts 7:19.\x*

\s1 The birth of Mosheh (Moses)
\rem /s1 Moses; The Birth of Moses; Birth and Youth of Moses
\p
\v 1 \add During this period,\add* a man¦25703 from the tribe of Levi married a woman who was also a Levite,
\v 2 and she conceived¦25713 and gave¦25715 birth¦25715 to a son. When she saw¦25717 that he was a \add healthy\add* boy, she hid him away for three¦25724 months¦25725,\x + \xo 2:2: \xt Acts 7:20; Heb 11:23.\x*
\v 3 \add but\add* then she wasn't able to hide him any longer. \add So\add* she got a basket made from \add woven\add* reeds and plastered it with bitumen and pitch¦25739. Then she put the baby in it, and floated \add the basket\add* in the reeds along the riverbank,
\v 4 \add leaving the baby's\add* sister¦25753 to watch from a distance¦25754 to see¦25755 what would happen to him.
\p
\v 5 \add After a while,\add* Far'oh's daughter¦25762 came down to the river¦25774 to wash \add herself\add*, and \add she and\add* her young \add attendants¦25769\add* were walking¦25770 along the \add riverbank\add*. She saw¦25775 the container among the reeds¦25780 and sent¦25781 \add one of\add* her slave¦25784 women to get it.
\v 6 She opened¦25787 it and saw¦25788 the baby inside, and wow, he \add started\add* crying¦25795. She felt sorry¦25796 for him and said¦25798, “This baby \add must be\add* one of the Hebrew¦25800 children¦25799.”
\p
\v 7 Then his sister¦25804 \add approached and\add* asked \add the princess\add*, “Would you like me to go¦25810 and find a Hebrew¦25816 woman¦25813 who'll be able to breastfeed the baby for you?”
\p
\v 8 “\add Yes,\add* go¦25829,” answered Far'oh's daughter¦25826, and the girl¦25831 went¦25830 and got the baby's mother¦25835.
\v 9 “Take this baby,” said¦25838 the \add princess\add*, “and breastfeed him for me, and I'll pay you \add for doing it\add*.” \add So\add* the woman¦25856 took¦25855 the baby and \add looked after\add* him.
\v 10 \add When\add* the boy had grown \add enough\add*, she brought¦25863 him \add back\add* to Far'oh's daughter¦25864 and he became her son. She named him ‘Mosheh¦25873’\f + \fr 2:10 \ft More familiar to most English readers as ‘Moses’ from the Greek ‘Μωσῆς’ (Mōsaʸs) but Greek doesn't have an ‘h’ or a ‘sh’ so by going through Greek we ended up with something quite different from his real name. However, English does have those sounds and letters, so there's no reason why we can't get this name correct.\f* \add (which means ‘pulled out’)\add* because she said¦25874 that she'd \add plucked\add* him out of the \add river\add*.\x + \xo 2:10: \xt Acts 7:21.\x*
\s1 Mosheh escapes to Midiyan
\rem /s1 Moses Escapes to Midian; Moses Flees to Midian
\p
\v 11 \add Later on\add* when Mosheh¦25886 was fully grown¦25885, he went out to visit \add the Hebrews\add* and saw their¦25892 \add forced¦25892 labour¦25892\add*, and he saw an Egyptian man beating a Hebrew man—one of his own people.\x + \xo 2:11-14: \xt Acts 7:23-28.\x*
\v 12 \add Mosheh\add* looked¦25902 around to check that no one was watching, then he hit the Egyptian, \add killing him,\add* then he hid his body in the sand.
\v 13 The next day¦25917, he went¦25916 out again and wow, two¦25920 Hebrew men¦25922 were fighting each other, and he said¦25925 to the man in the wrong¦25926, “Why are you hitting your \add fellow Hebrew\add*?”
\p
\v 14 “Who made you the ruler and judge¦25936 over us?” \add the man¦25934 replied\add*. “Are you \add planning\add* to kill¦25938 me like you killed¦25942 \add that\add* Egyptian?” Then Mosheh¦25947 was afraid¦25946 because he realised that what he'd done had \add probably become widely\add* known¦25950.
\v 15 \add Indeed,\add* when Far'oh¦25954 heard about it, he \add ordered\add* Mosheh to be killed. \add So\add* Mosheh had to flee from \add the king\add* and he \add took off east\add* to live in Midian¦25971 and he stayed near the well.\x + \xo 2:15: \xt Acts 7:29; Heb 11:27.\x*
\p
\v 16 The¦25984 priest¦25977 there in Midian¦25978 had seven¦25979 daughters¦25980, and they would come to the well to draw water out and fill up the troughs¦25986 there so their¦25989 father's¦25989 \add sheep and goats\add* could drink.
\v 17 Now¦25998 some male shepherds¦25992 came along and \add started to\add* shoo their flock¦26000 away, but Mosheh¦25995 got involved and helped them so that their animals could drink.
\v 18 \add When\add* they \add got home\add* to their¦26006 father¦26006 Reuel, he \add asked\add*, “How come¦26010 you¦26009 \add got home\add* so early today?”
\p
\v 19 “There was an Egyptian man¦26014,” they \add answered\add*, “who stood up for us against those \add other\add* shepherds¦26018. And he even drew \add water\add* for us and gave our flock¦26027 water to drink.”
\p
\v 20 “Where is he \add now\add*?” he \add asked them\add*. “What's this—you mean you all just left him there? Go and get him \add so we can give him a meal\add*.”
\p
\v 21 \add Later it turned out that\add* Mosheh was prepared to live with the man¦26050, and¦26051 \add in due course\add* he gave¦26051 his daughter¦26055 Zipporah to Mosheh \add in marriage\add*.
\v 22 \add When\add* she gave¦26058 birth¦26058 to a son, he named him ‘Gershom’ \add (which means ‘foreigner’)\add* because he said¦26066, “I've become¦26068 a foreigner \add living\add* in a foreign¦26070 land.”
\p
\v 23 \add Eventually\add* Egypt's king¦26078 died¦26077, \add but\add* the Israelis¦26083 groaned¦26080 from the slavery \add they were still under\add* and they cried¦26087 out, and their¦26089 cry¦26089 \add for freedom\add* from slavery went¦26088 up to God.
\v 24 \add He\add* heard their¦26101 groaning¦26101 and remembered¦26102 his agreement with Abraham, with Yitshak, and with Yacob,\x + \xo 2:24: \xt Gen 15:13-14.\x*
\v 25 and he \add looked down on\add* the Israelis¦26122 and he \add was concerned about them\add*.

\rem /s1 God Calls Moses; Moses at the Burning Bush; Moses and the Burning Bush
\p
\v 1 \add One time\add* Mosheh¦26127 (Moses) was shepherding the flock of his father-in-law¦26134 Yetro (or Jethro, the priest¦26135 at Midian¦26136), and he led the flock beyond the wilderness¦26142 and came¦26143 to a hill. (\add This was later known as\add* the mountain¦26146 of God at Horeb¦26148).
\v 2 \add While he was there.\add* Yahweh's¦26152 messenger appeared¦26150 to him in a flame¦26154 coming from the middle of a bush, and as \add Mosheh\add* looked, to his surprise \add he saw that\add* the bush was burning¦26162 in the fire yet not \add actually\add* being burnt up.\x + \xo 3:2-10: \xt Acts 7:30-34.\x*
\v 3 “I've got to go and¦26173 see¦26173 this amazing sight¦26176,” Mosheh¦26169 said¦26168 \add to himself\add*. “How come the bush isn't burning¦26182 up?”
\p
\v 4 When Yahweh¦26186 saw¦26185 that he'd left his path in order to look, God¦26192 called¦26190 to him from the middle of the bush, “Mosheh, Mosheh.”
\p “I'm here,” he \add replied\add*.
\p
\v 5 “Don't come any closer,” \add Yahweh\add* said¦26201. “Take off your sandals¦26208 because the place¦26212 where you'e standing¦26215 is HOLY ground¦26217.
\v 6 I'm the God of your father and the God of Abraham, Yitshak, and Yacob.” \add So\add* Mosheh¦26233 covered hid his face because he was scared to look¦26237 at God.
\p
\v 7 “I've certainly noticed the suffering¦26262 of my people¦26249 in Egypt¦26251,” Yahweh¦26243 \add continued\add*, “I've heard¦26255 their cries as the \add slave drivers\add* oppress them—I'm unmistakingly aware of their pain.
\v 8 \add So\add* I've come¦26264 down to set them free from Egyptian control and to bring¦26269 them up from \add there\add* to a good¦26277 and wide land—a land flowing¦26282 with milk and honey¦26284. \add It's currently\add* the place¦26287 of the Canaanites¦26288, the Hittites¦26289, the Amorites¦26290, the Perizzites¦26291, the Hivites¦26292, and the Jebusites¦26293.
\v 9 \add Yes,\add* the cry¦26297 of the Israelis¦26300 has now \add reached\add* me and¦26303 what's more, I've seen¦26305 \add how much\add* the Egyptians are oppressing¦26308 them.
\v 10 \add So\add* go now and I'll send you to Far'oh¦26319 (Pharaoh) and bring¦26320 my people—Yisra'el's descendants—out from Egypt.”
\p
\v 11 “Who am I, that I should go¦26337 to Far'oh¦26340,” Mosheh¦26330 \add asked\add* God, “and¦26341 that I should \add be the one to\add* bring¦26342 out the Israelis¦26346 out from Egypt?”
\p
\v 12 “I'll certainly be with you,” \add God replied,\add* “and this will be your sign¦26357 \add so that you'll know\add* that I have sent¦26360 you: when you bring the people¦26364 out from Egypt, you all will serve God on this \add very\add* hill.”
\rem /s1 The Divine Name Revealed
\p
\v 13 “\add But listen\add*,” Mosheh¦26375 told God, “\add If\add* I'm about¦26381 to go¦26381 to the Israelis¦26385 and if I told them, ‘The God of your¦26389 ancestors¦26389 has sent¦26390 me to you¦26391.’ then they'd \add ask¦26392\add* me, ‘\add Oh yeah,\add* what's his name¦26397?’ then what would I tell them?”\x + \xo 3:13: \xt Exo 6:2-3.\x*
\p
\v 14 “I AM WHO I AM,” God¦26403 told Mosheh¦26406. “You'll \add tell them this\add*: ‘I AM sent¦26416 me to you.’ ”\x + \xo 3:14: \xt Rev 1:4,8.\x*
\v 15 Then he \add continued\add*, “This is what you \add need\add* to tell the Israelis¦26431: ‘Yahweh¦26432, the God of your ancestors¦26434, the God of Abraham, Yitshak, and Yacob, sent me to you. This is my name forever, and this is my memorial from generation to generation.’
\v 16 Go and gather the Israeli elders¦26456, and tell them, ‘Yahweh¦26460, the God of your ancestors¦26462, appeared¦26463 to me, the God of Abraham, Yitshak, and Yacob, to say, “I've certainly noticed you all and \add how you're all being treated\add* in Egypt¦26477,
\v 17 and I've promised¦26479 to take you¦26481 all from your mistreatment in Egypt, away to the land where the Canaanites¦26487, Hittites¦26488, Amorites¦26489, Perizzites¦26490, Hivites¦26491, and the Jebusites¦26492 \add are currently living\add*—to a land flowing¦26496 with milk and honey¦26498.” ’
\p
\v 18 Then \add the people\add* will listen¦26500 to what you tell them, and you and the Israeli elders¦26504 will go to the Egyptian king¦26508 and you'll all tell him, ‘Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews¦26514, has met with us. \add So\add* now, please¦26520 let us go three¦26522 days' journey¦26521 into the wilderness¦26524, so we can sacrifice¦26525 to Yahweh, our God.’
\v 19 \add But\add* I know¦26530 that the Egyptian king¦26536 won't let you¦26535 go¦26538 \add until he's forced to\add*.
\v 20 \add So I will use force\add* and I'll strike¦26547 Egypt with \add several supernatural acts\add*, and after¦26556 those, he'll let you¦26560 all go¦26559.

\v 21 Then I'll \add make\add* the Egyptian \add people¦26566 favour¦26565 you all in such a way that \add* when you go, you \add won't leave empty-handed¦26576\add*.\x + \xo 3:21-22: \xt Exo 12:35-36.\x*

\p
\v 1 “But listen,” Mosheh¦26602 responded, “they won't believe¦26607 me and won't listen to \add what I say\add*, because they'll say, ‘Yahweh¦26618 never showed himself to you.’”
\v 2 “\add Well,\add* what's that in your hand¦26626?” Yahweh¦26622 \add asked\add*.
\p “\add My shepherd's\add* staff¦26628,” he said.
\v 3 “Throw it on the ground,” \add Yahweh\add* said¦26630. \add So Mosheh¦26638\add* he threw¦26633 it onto the ground and it became a snake¦26636, and \add he quickly moved back away from it\add*.
\v 4 “Pick it up by its tail.” Yahweh¦26642 told him. \add So Mosheh¦26645\add* picked it up by the tail and it became a staff¦26655 in his hand \add again\add*.
\v 5 “That's so that they'll believe¦26659 that \add I\add* appeared¦26662 to you¦26663: Yahweh¦26664—the God of their¦26666 ancestors¦26666—the God of Abraham, Yitshak, and¦26671 Yacob.”
\p
\v 6 “\add Now\add* put your hand \add on your chest—\add*inside your robe.” Yahweh¦26675 added. \add So Mosheh did that\add*, and when he pulled it out again¦26677, his hand had gone \add totally\add* white with disease.
\v 7 Then Yahweh said, “\add Now, put\add* your hand \add back in again\add*.” \add So Mosheh did it again,\add* and when he pulled it out, wow, it had \add returned¦26693 to normal\add*.
\v 8 “\add So,\add* if they don't¦26713 believe you, and \add if the first¦26720 miracle doesn't convince them\add*, then they'll believe \add that second¦26724 miracle\add*.
\v 9 And then, even if they don't¦26729 believe those two miracles and \add won't believe what you tell them\add*, then you should take some water from the river and pour it onto the dry land.

\p
\v 10 “Oh my master¦26760,” Mosheh¦26755 \add responded\add*, “I'm not \add very good at speaking to others—I never have been and¦26780 still aren't. I seem to get tongue-tied¦26781 easily\add*.”

\p
\v 14 Then Yahweh¦26830 got angry with Mosheh¦26831 and told him, “Isn't Aharon¦26834 (Aaron) a fellow Levite and your brother¦26835?

\v 1 After that, Mosheh¦27158 and Aharon¦27159 went¦27157 in and said¦27160 to Far'oh¦27163, “This is what Israel's God¦27168 Yahweh¦27167 says¦27166: ‘Let my people¦27173 go¦27170, \add so\add* they can celebrate me \add out\add* in the wilderness¦27176.’ ”

\p
\v 4 “Mosheh¦27227 and¦27228 Aharon¦27228,” the king¦27224 of Egypt¦27225 answered, “why are you¦27229 causing¦27229 the people¦27232 to \add slacken\add* off from their¦27233 tasks? \add Get¦27230 back\add* to your¦27235 \add work\add*.”

\rem /s1 Making Bricks without Straw
\p
\v 6 Then on that \add very same\add* day¦27251, Far'oh¦27250 ordered the people's¦27256 slave masters and¦27257 supervisors,
\v 7 “Don't give¦27264 straw to the people¦27266 to make bricks¦27268 with as \add you've done up till now\add*. They can go and gather¦27273 straw for themselves.
\v 8 But \add keep\add* the \add same\add* quota of bricks¦27280 \add as before\add*—don't¦27288 decrease it because they \add must be\add* idle \add if they have time to say\add*, ‘Let us go—let us sacrifice¦27302 to our God¦27303.’
\v 9 \add Give the men¦27309 more work so they'll be too busy to worry about deceptive words¦27316\add*.”
\p
\v 10 \add So\add* the slave masters and supervisors of the people went out and told \add them all\add*, “\add The king\add* has said that he won't give you any more straw¦27335,

\v 12 So the people¦27351 dispersed throughout all of Egypt¦27355 to gather¦27356 stubble¦27357 for straw¦27358,

\v 14 Then the Israeli foremen¦27374 that Far'oh's slave masters had appointed¦27379 were beaten¦27373 and told, “Why haven't you¦27386 met your¦27387 required¦27387 brick¦27388 making \add quota\add* yesterday or today? \add It's just the same as in the past\add*.”
\p
\v 15 \add So\add* the Israeli foremen¦27399 went¦27398 and¦27402 complained to Far'oh¦27405, “Why are you¦27408 treating your¦27410 servants¦27410 like this?
\v 16 We haven't been given¦27414 any straw and yet they're telling us to keep making bricks¦27416. And see, we your servants get beaten, but it's your people's¦27424 mistake.”
\p
\v 17 “You're all lazy—plain lazy!” \add the king responded\add*. “That's why you're saying¦27434, ‘Let us go¦27435 sacrifice¦27436 to Yahweh.’

\v 4 \add What's more,\add* I made an agreement with them: to give¦27589 them the Canaan¦27594 region—the area which¦27598 they¦27600 had been staying in.
\v 5 \add Furthermore,\add* I've heard¦27606 the complaints from the Israelis¦27611 who have been enslaved by the Egyptians, and¦27616 I have remembered¦27616 my agreement.
\v 6 Therefore, tell the Israelis¦27625, ‘I am Yahweh¦27628 and I will \add help you escape from\add* the \add control\add* of the Egyptians and rescue you from their slavery. I'll buy you out of slavery using my power and by \add punishing the Egyptians for this injustice\add*.
\v 7 I'll take¦27644 you all to be my own people¦27647, and I'll be your God. Then you'll know¦27651 that I am Yahweh¦27654 your God—the one rescuing you all from the Egyptian oppression.

\v 3 The frogs¦28625 will swarm in the river, then they'll climb out and go into your house and in your bedroom and onto your bed. They'll go into your servants' houses and among your people, and in your \add cooking\add* bowls and into your ovens.
\v 4 They'll climb on you and on your people and on all your servants.’ ”
\p
\v 5 Then Yahweh said¦28653 to Mosheh¦28654, “Tell Aharon: Hold your staff out over the canals, the streams, and the pools, and cause the frogs¦28665 to come up onto the land of Egypt.”
\v 6 \add So\add* Aharon reached out his hand over the Egyptian water \add supplies\add* and frogs came up and covered the land of Egypt.
\v 7 \add But\add* the sorcerers did the same with their magic, and they¦28694 \add too\add* brought up frogs¦28687 over the land of Egypt.
\p
\v 8 Then Far'oh¦28701 called for Mosheh and Aharon¦28699, and told \add them\add*, “Ask Yahweh to take the frogs¦28710 away from me and from my people. Then I'll let \add your\add* people go, and they can sacrifice to Yahweh.”
\p
\v 9 Mosheh¦28720 answered, “I'll pray for you and your servants and your people, \add praying that\add* the frogs¦28722 will keep away from you and your homes and only be left in the river. \add And I'll give you the honour of specifying when it'll happen\add*.”
\p
\v 10 “Tomorrow \add morning\add*,” \add the king replied\add*.
\p “Just as you say,” \add Mosheh responded\add*, “so that you'll know that there's no one \add else\add* like our God Yahweh.
\v 11 \add Tomorrow\add* the frogs will leave you and go away from your houses, and from your servants and your people. They'll only be left in the river.”
\v 12 Then Mosheh and Aharon¦28768 left Far'oh and Mosheh called out to Yahweh¦28761 concerning the \add retraction\add* of the frogs that he'd sent against \add the king\add*.
\v 13 \add So\add* Yahweh did what Mosheh had requested and the frogs died off from the houses and the courtyards, and from the fields.
\v 14 \add The¦28822 people\add* collected them into many piles and the \add whole country\add* stank.
\v 15 \add But when\add* Far'oh¦28837 saw that there was \add relief from the frogs\add*, he \add firmed his resolve\add* and didn't listen¦28847 to \add Mosheh and Aharon\add*, just as Yahweh¦28851 had said \add previously\add*.
\s1 Plague 3: Lice
\rem /s1 A Plague of Gnats; The Third Plague: Gnats; The Plague of Gnats
\p
\v 16 Then Yahweh said¦28855 to Mosheh¦28859, “Tell Aharon: Stretch out your staff and strike the dust on the ground, and it will turn into lice\f + \fr 8:16 \ft The Hebrew word ‘כֵּן/כִּנִּם’ (kēn/kinnim) could refer to either lice, gnats, or fleas. However, unlike lice, gnats don't usually \em reside\em* on people and animals (which seems to be implied by the text).\f* all over Egypt.”
\v 17 So Aharon held out his staff and struck the dust \add with it\add*, and \add the dust\add* became lice on the people and on the animals. All over Egypt, the dust turned into lice
\v 18 and the sorcerers tried to do the same with their magic but they were unable to. \add So\add* there¦28923 were lice on people¦28917 and animals
\v 19 and the magicians said to Far'oh, “This is God's finger.” \add But Far'oh was stubborn\add* and he didn't listen to them, just as Yahweh had said \add previously\add*.\x + \xo 8:19: \xt Luk 11:20.\x*
\s1 Plague 4: The swarm
\rem /s1 The Fourth Plague: Flies; A Plague of Flies; The Plague of Flies
\p
\v 20 Then Yahweh said to Mosheh, “Get up early in the morning and \add when you see Far'oh¦28953\add* coming down to the river, station yourself in front¦28962 of \add him\add* and tell him, ‘Yahweh saw that you \add must\add* let my people go \add so \add* they can serve me.
\v 21 Certainly if you don't release my people immediately, then take note: I'm about to send the swarm\f + \fr 8:21 \ft The Hebrew word ‘עָרֹב’ (ˊārov) probably meaning ‘mixture’ is sometimes translated as ‘swarm’. This plague could have been anything from flies to other insects (hornets or mosquitoes???) all the way to a mixture of wild animals.\f* at you and your servants and at your people and into your houses. The Egyptians' houses will be full of the swarm and even the ground that they're on.
\v 22 \add But when it happens,\add* I'll distinguish the Goshen region where my people live so the swarm won't be there, \add so that you'll be able to see\add* that I'm Yahweh \add and I'm right here\add* in this land.
\v 23 This sign will happen tomorrow and¦29007 \add you'll see how I plan to set my people free\add* from your people.’ ”
\v 24 \add So\add* Yahweh did \add what he'd said¦29015\add* and a heavy swarm came to Far'oh's house and the houses of his servants and all the Egyptians—the country was ruined by the \add arrival\add* of the swarm.
\p
\v 25 Then Far'oh¦29046 called for Mosheh¦29035 and to Aharon and told \add them\add*, “Go and sacrifice¦29061 to the God of you¦29039 all, \add but here in Egypt\add*.”
\p
\v 26 “It wouldn't be right to do that,” Mosheh¦29066 \add replied\add*, “because our sacrifices to Yahweh¦29072 our God \add would be offensive\add* to Egyptians. Listen, if we made sacrifices in front of the Egyptians \add that are repulsive to them\add*, wouldn't they \add throw rocks at us to try to kill us\add*?
\v 27 We need to travel into the wilderness for three days, then we'll sacrifice to our God Yahweh¦29076 \add there\add*, just like he's telling us to.”
\p
\v 28 \add So\add* Far'oh¦29090 \add relented\add*, “I'll let you all go into the wilderness and sacrifice to Yahweh your God—except you definitely can't go very far. \add Now,\add* ask God for me \add for the plague to stop\add*.”
\p
\v 29 “Listen, I'm about to \add leave now\add*,” Mosheh \add responded\add*, “and I'll pray to Yahweh and he'll withdraw the swarm from Far'oh tomorrow, and from his servants and his people. \add But\add* may Far'oh not be dishonest \add again and\add* fail to let our people go to sacrifice to Yahweh.”
\p
\v 30 Then Mosheh left Far'oh and prayed to Yahweh
\v 31 and Yahweh did \add what\add* Mosheh \add asked him\add* and he withdrew the swarm from Far'oh, and from his servants and his people. Not one remained.
\v 32 \add But\add* Far'oh \add changed his mind and remained stubborn and he wouldn't let the Israelis leave\add*.

\s1 Plague 5: The stock disease
\rem /s2 Death of the Animals
\rem /s1 The Fifth Plague: Livestock Diseased; The Plague on Livestock; A Plague against Livestock
\p
\v 1 Then Yahweh said to Mosheh¦29108, “Go in to Far'oh¦29112 and tell him: ‘This is what the God¦29119 of the Hebrews¦29120. Yahweh, says: Let my people¦29124 go \add so\add* they can serve me.
\v 2 Certainly if you're unwilling to release them and if you keep holding onto them,
\v 3 then listen. Yahweh¦29140 is about¦29141 to \add inflict\add* a very serious plague on your¦29142 livestock¦29142 which¦29143 are in the fields¦29144—on the horses¦29145, the donkeys¦29146, the camels¦29147, the cattle, and on the flock¦29149.
\v 4 \add But\add* Yahweh¦29155 will distinguish¦29154 between the livestock of the Israelis and the Egyptians—none of the Israelis' animals will die¦29163.’ ”
\v 5 Then Yahweh \add said when it would happen\add*, “Yahweh will do this \add to Egypt\add* tomorrow¦29174.”
\p
\v 6 \add So\add* the next day¦29187 Yahweh¦29182 did \add what he'd said\add* and all of the livestock of the Egyptians died, yet none at all from the livestock of the Israelis¦29195 died.
\v 7 Far'oh sent \add people to investigate\add*, and wow, not even one of the livestock¦29207 of the Israelis¦29208 had died. \add But\add* Far'oh was strong-willed and wouldn't let the people go.
\s1 Plague 6: Boils
\rem /s1 The Plague of Boils; The Sixth Plague: Boils; A Plague of Boils
\p
\v 8 Then Yahweh¦29223 told Mosheh and Aharon¦29229, “Take handfuls of ash out of a furnace, then Mosheh should \add toss it up in the air in front\add* of Far'oh¦29240.
\v 9 It will become a powder over all Egypt and then it will turn into boils¦29256—bursting blisters¦29258—on people and on animals all over Egypt.”
\v 10 \add So\add* they took¦29264 some ash from a furnace, and standing in front¦29270 of Far'oh¦29271, Mosheh¦29274 \add tossed it up into the air\add* and it turned into boils with bursting blisters¦29278 on the people and the animals.\x + \xo 9:10: \xt Rev 16:2.\x*
\v 11 Because of the boils, the sorcerers weren't \add even\add* able to stand¦29287 \add there with\add* Mosheh¦29289 because the sorcerers \add suffered with them\add* along with all the Egyptians.
\v 12 \add But\add* Yahweh caused Far'oh¦29306 to remain stubborn and he didn't listen¦29308 to them, just as Yahweh had told Mosheh¦29315 \add previously\add*.
\s1 Plague 7: Hail
\rem /s1 A Plague of Hail; The Seventh Plague: Thunder and Hail; The Plague of Hail
\p
\v 13 Then Yahweh told Mosheh¦29322, “Get up early¦29323 in the morning¦29324, and stand in front¦29326 of Far'oh¦29327 and say¦29328 to him, ‘This is what Yahweh, the God¦29334 of the Hebrews¦29335, says¦29332: Let my people¦29339 go¦29336 so they can serve me
\v 14 because this time¦29344, I'm about¦29347 to send¦29347 all my plagues¦29352 to you and your servants, and your people¦29357. \add You'll all be deeply distressed by them\add*, in order that you might know¦29359 that there¦29361 is no \add one else\add* like me in all the world.
\v 15 \add By this time\add*, I could have teached out and struck¦29373 you and your people¦29377 with such a plague¦29378 that you would all have been obliterated from the land.
\v 16 However, I've kept you for this reason: to show you my power¦29392 and in order to proclaim my name¦29395 all over the world.\x + \xo 9:16: \xt Rom 9:17.\x*
\v 17 You're still considering yourself¦29401 to be greater than my people¦29402 by failing to release them.
\v 18 \add Now\add* listen: I'm about¦29407 to cause extremely heavy¦29411 hail to rain \add down\add* at this time¦29408 tomorrow¦29409. \add It'll be hail like\add* which¦29413 has never been \add seen before\add* in Egypt¦29418 from the day¦29421 it was founded¦29422 until now.
\v 19 \add So\add* send¦29428 for your livestock¦29432 and everything you own in the country now, and bring¦29429 it in under cover because the hail will come down on every person and animal¦29442 that is found¦29445 in the countryside and not \add sheltering under a roof\add*, and they will die¦29453.’ ”
\v 20 Some of Far'oh's servants¦29465 who believed what Yahweh¦29459 said, quickly brought their slaves and their livestock¦29468 back into their houses¦29471,
\v 21 but those \add people\add* who didn't believe Yahweh¦29481 \add just\add* left their slaves and their animals out in the countryside.
\p
\v 22 “Raise your¦29500 arm up toward the sky,” Yahweh¦29493 told Mosheh¦29496, “and hail \add will strike\add* all over Egypt—on the people and animals and on every plant in the Egyptian countryside.”
\v 23 \add So\add* Moses lifted his staff¦29528 to the sky, and Yahweh sent thunder¦29534 and hail, and \add lightning caused fires\add* on the land, and \add so\add* Yahweh rained¦29539 hail \add down\add* onto Egypt.
\v 24 There was hail, and \add also\add* fire¦29549 coming \add down\add* in the middle¦29551 of the hail. It was very heavy¦29553, such as had never been in all of Egypt since¦29564 it became a nation¦29566.\x + \xo 9:24: \xt Rev 8:7; 16:21.\x*
\v 25 The hail struck everything in Egypt¦29573—everything that was in the countryside, from people to animals. \add It also\add* struck every plant and broke every tree¦29594 \add out\add* in the countryside.
\v 26 Only in the Goshen region where¦29601 the Israelis¦29605 were, was there¦29603 no hail.
\p
\v 27 Then Far'oh¦29611 sent¦29610 for Mosheh¦29613 and Aharon¦29614 and told them, “I've sinned¦29617 this time¦29618. Yahweh¦29619 is righteous¦29620, and me and my people¦29622 are guilty.
\v 28 Pray to Yahweh¦29628 \add to stop it,\add* because the thunder¦29631 of God¦29632 and hail are too much. Then I'll release you all—you won't have to remain \add here\add*.”
\p
\v 29 “As I'm leaving the city¦29646,” Mosheh¦29642 \add replied\add*, “I'll spread¦29647 my palms \add out\add* to Yahweh. The thunder¦29654 will stop and the hail won't continue so that you¦29662 \add will be able to see\add* that the earth¦29665 belongs to Yahweh.
\v 30 \add But as for\add* you and¦29668 your¦29668 servants, I know¦29669 that you still don't¦29671 fear¦29672 Yahweh¦29674 God¦29675.”
\p
\v 31 (\add Now¦29680\add* the flax and the barley were \add flattened by the hail\add* because the barley was \add full grown and starting to fill out\add* and the flax was in bloom.
\v 32 But¦29690 the wheat¦29686 and the spelt¦29687 weren't \add destroyed because they come later in the season\add*.)
\p
\v 33 \add So¦29698\add* Mosheh¦29695 left Far'oh¦29697, and as he was leaving the city¦29700, he spread¦29701 his palms \add out\add* to Yahweh¦29705 and the thunder¦29707 and hail ceased¦29706, and the rain stopped pouring down on the land.
\v 34 \add But¦29717 when\add* Far'oh¦29716 saw¦29715 that the rain and hail and thunder¦29722 had stopped, he added to his sins and he \add firmed his resolve\add*—he and his servants.
\v 35 And¦29735 \add so\add* Far'oh¦29732 \add remained stubborn\add* and didn't let the Israelis¦29738 leave, just as Yahweh¦29741 had said¦29740 through Mosheh¦29744 \add previously\add*.

\v 2 and so that \add in the future you'll be able to tell your descendants\add* that I \add made\add* Egypt \add look foolish\add*, and my miracles which¦29788 I demonstrated among them—and \add so that\add* you will know¦29792 that I am Yahweh¦29796.”
\p
\v 3 \add So\add* Mosheh¦29799 and Aharon¦29800 went¦29798 in to Far'oh¦29803 and told him, “This is what Yahweh¦29809, God¦29810 of the Hebrews¦29811 says¦29808: \add how long before¦29817 you'll submit to me\add*? Let my people¦29819 go¦29818 \add so\add* they¦29804 can serve me,

\v 5 They'll cover¦29837 the ground so that no one will \add even\add* be able to see it, and they'll devour whatever remains¦29852 after the hail. Plus they'll devour every¦29862 tree¦29864 growing¦29865 in the countryside.
\v 6 They'll fill your houses and the houses of all your servants¦29876 and the houses of all the Egyptians. It'll be nothing like anything which¦29881 your \add parents generation\add* ever saw, nor anything seen by the \add previous generations\add* from the day they came to be on the earth until¦29893 today.” Then \add Mosheh\add* turned¦29896 around and went¦29889 out from Far'oh¦29899 \add with Aharon\add*.
\p
\v 7 Then Far'oh's servants¦29902 \add asked\add* him, “How much longer is this \add going to cause trouble\add* for us? Let the men¦29915 go¦29912 and¦29916 they'll worship¦29916 their¦29920 God¦29920 Yahweh¦29919. Don't you¦29922 understand yet that Egypt \add is being destroyed\add*?”
\p
\v 8 \add So\add* Mosheh¦29930 and Aharon¦29933 were brought¦29927 back to Far'oh¦29936, and he told them, “Go and worship your¦29944 God¦29944 Yahweh¦29943. Who \add are the ones\add* who'll be going¦29947?”
\p
\v 9 “We'll take our children and our old folks,” Mosheh¦29950 \add answered\add*. “We'll go with our sons¦29954 and daughters¦29955, and with our flocks¦29956 and herds¦29957, because the festival¦29960 of Yahweh¦29962 is for \add all of\add* us.”
\p
\v 10 “\add You'd need Yahweh¦29969 with you if I ever\add* let you and your children go¦29972 \add together\add*,” Far'oh \add responded\add*. “You're clearly \add plotting an evil¦29979 trick\add*!
\v 11 \add Well that won't happen!\add* The men¦29988 may go¦29985 and worship¦29989 Yahweh¦29992 since that's what you've been wanting.” Then he drove¦29997 them \add out of the room\add*.
\p
\v 12 Then Yahweh¦30005 told Mosheh¦30008, “Extend your¦30010 hand¦30010 over Egypt¦30014 and let \add the locusts¦30015\add* rise up over the land, and let \add them\add* devour all the plants—everything which the hail had spared.”
\v 13 \add So\add* Mosheh¦30036 stretched¦30035 his staff¦30039 out over Egypt, and Yahweh sent an east wind over the land all that day¦30051 and all night¦30055. Then morning¦30056 came, and the east wind had brought the locusts¦30063.
\v 14 The locusts covered across all the land of Egypt and came to rest everywhere within the \add country's\add* borders. They were extremely numerous—never before¦30078 were there so many locusts, and it'll never be \add repeated again¦30085\add*.\x + \xo 10:14-15: \xt Rev 9:2-3.\x*
\v 15 \add The cloud of locusts blocked the sun\add* and \add prevented people from being able to see very far\add*.

\p
\v 16 Far'oh¦30130 quickly summoned Mosheh¦30132 and Aharon¦30133 and said¦30134, “I've sinned¦30135 against your¦30137 God¦30137 Yahweh and against you¦30138.
\v 17 So now just this once, please¦30142 \add overlook\add* my sin¦30143 and pray to your¦30148 God¦30148 Yahweh and just let him take this \add deathly¦30154 plague\add* away from me.”
