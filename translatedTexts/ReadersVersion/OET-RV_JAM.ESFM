\is1 Introduction
\is2 Author
\ip The author of this letter is commonly known as ‘James’ in English translations, but most people don't realise that his English name should be Yacob (or Yakob if you wanted to be even closer to the original). This translation error can be traced all the way back to Yohan Wycliffe's English translation from the Latin in the 1300's as he didn't have access to Greek New Testament manuscripts (although he did use Yacob in some parts of his New Testament when it referred to the son of Isaac). The confusion was probably due to changes in the way Latin was spoken over the centuries, and then translating the name from the historically-altered Latin instead of from the original Greek—see https://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/daily/biblical-topics/bible-versions-and-translations/james-or-Yacob-in-the-bible for more details.
\ip Note from the first sentence in the letter that Yacob addressed the letter to the twelve tribes who originated from the twelve sons of his namesake.
\is2 This letter
\ip This \bk Letter from Yacob\bk* is Yacob's collection of advice to those who believe there is a God in heaven. He wrote this to all people scattered all around the world. Yacob used examples in order to explain his advice, so that their behaviour would improve and also their daily work. He also taught on various topics like: faith, testing, suffering, showing, respect, good behaviour, watching what you say, true wisdom from God, and prayer.
\ip He said that our faith is deficient if we don't also demonstrate it by our actions.

\s1 Gaining endurance and requesting wisdom
\rem /s1 Faith and Endurance
\rem /s1 Trials and Temptations
\rem /s1 Faith and Wisdom
\rem /s1 Faith under trial
\p
\v 2 Be cheerful¦147444 my¦147447 fellow¦147446 believers¦147446, when you¦147450 face a range¦147451 of difficult situations,
\v 3 knowing¦147453 that you¦147457 will learn endurance¦147461 as your¦147457 faith¦147459 is tested.
\v 4 Let that endurance¦147464 do its¦147466 perfect work so that you¦147469 all might become perfect and¦147471 mature—not lacking¦147475 anything.
\p
\v 5 If anyone¦147478 of you is lacking¦147480 wisdom¦147481, then it should be requested¦147482 from God¦147488 who gives it generously¦147490 and without disparagement, and so it will be given¦147496 to you,
\v 6 but the person who's asking should demonstrate their faith¦147501 and not be doubting. That's because¦147505 a person who doubts is like a wave on the sea¦147509 that's just blown¦147510 and tossed¦147512 around
\v 7 and a person¦147517 like that shouldn't expect to get anything¦147521 from the master¦147525
\rem /s1 Poverty and Riches
\v 8 because that person is doubled-minded¦147527, and everything they attempt ends up in difficulty.
\s1 Behaviour of the poor and the wealthy
\p
\v 9 Those of humbler¦147539 means can boast¦147534 about their greatness
\v 10 whereas the wealthy¦147546 can boast about their weakness because¦147552 they'll pass away just like the daisies in the grass¦147555.\x + \xo 1:10-11: \xt Isa 40:6-7 (LXX).\x*
\v 11 When the sun¦147560 rises with its scorching¦147563 heat and withers¦147565 the grass¦147567, the flowers¦147570 will drop and lose all their beauty¦147575. So too for rich people who'll fade away right in the middle of all their projects.
\s1 Testing and temptation
\rem /s1 Trial and Temptation
\rem /s1 Testing and Tempting
\p
\v 12 Any person who's enduring¦147594 testing circumstances is fortunate, because¦147597 once they've passed the test, they'll receive¦147600 a crown¦147602 of life¦147604 that Yeshua promised¦147606 to those who love him¦147611.
\v 13 No one should say ‘It's God tempting me’ when they're being tempted, because God can't be tempted to do evil¦147626 and¦147628 he¦147629 doesn't tempt others,
\v 14 but rather they're being tempted¦147633 by their own lusts. They're being drawn¦147638 away and¦147639 enticed¦147640 \add into what they know is wrong\add*,
\v 15 and after the desire¦147643 is conceived¦147644 it leads to sin, and once the sin is concluded it leads to death¦147652.
\p
\v 16 Don't be led astray, my¦147656 dear brothers¦147655 and¦147655 sisters¦147655.
\v 17 Every¦147658 gift¦147663 that's good¦147660 and¦147661 perfect¦147664 comes from heaven. It comes down from the father¦147671 of lights¦147673, none of which are changing or casting moving shadows¦147683.
\v 18 Once he had decided it, he created us by his spoken commands so that we'd become a kind of special first¦147694 ‘harvest’ out of all of his creatures.
\s1 Listening then doing
\rem /s1 Hearing and Doing
\rem /s1 Hearing and Doing the Word
\rem /s1 Listening and Doing
\p
\v 19 So my¦147705 dear brothers¦147704 and sisters¦147704, note this: Everyone should be quick¦147713 to listen but slow to speak¦147720, and should be slow to get angry
\v 20 because¦147725 when people get very angry, it doesn't lead to the good behaviour that God¦147728 expects.
\v 21 So discard all \add moral\add* filth¦147735 and the evil¦147739 that's plentiful, and humbly accept the message¦147746 that's implanted¦147745 in you¦147752 all and which is capable of saving your¦147752 souls¦147751.
\p
\v 22 Don't delude¦147762 yourselves¦147763 by just listening¦147760 to the message¦147756, but put it into practice \add in your daily lives\add*.
\v 23 Anyone who is just a listener¦147767 of the message¦147768 and¦147770 does nothing with it is like someone who looks at their face¦147779 in a mirror¦147784
\v 24 but goes away after having a look and then immediately¦147791 forgets what they looked like.
\v 25 However the person who investigates¦147797 the perfect¦147800 law that gives freedom¦147803, and then sticks with it, not being just an observer that forgets¦147809 about it but rather a person who puts it into practice, this person will prosper in whatever they do.
\p
\v 26 If anyone¦147823 supposes¦147824 that they're religious but¦147836 doesn't guard what comes out of their mouth, then that person's religion is only skin deep and hasn't affected their heart¦147838.
\v 27 A person who wants to truly serve our¦147852 God¦147853 and father¦147856 with a pure heart would be visiting¦147859 orphans¦147860 and widows¦147862 in their¦147866 difficulties and staying unstained by worldly¦147874 ideas.

\s1 Avoiding favouritism

\rem /s1 Warning against Prejudice
\rem /s1 Love your neighbour as yourself
\p
\v 1 My¦147876 dear brothers¦147875 and¦147875 sisters¦147875, as you live out your faith¦147882 in our¦147885 honoured master¦147884 Yeshua¦147886 the messiah¦147887, don't¦147877 show favouritism¦147879 to others.
\v 2 For \add example\add*, if a man in nicely cut clothes and wearing an expensive gold¦147898 ring came into to your¦147896 meeting as well as a poor man in filthy¦147907 clothes
\v 3 and you told the well-dressed one, ‘You sit here in this good¦147925 chair,’ while telling the poor man, ‘You stand¦147931 over here,’ or ‘You sit here on the mat,’
\v 4 wouldn't that discrimination show that you¦147947 have judged¦147952 them with evil¦147954 motives.
\v 5 Listen my¦147957 dear brothers¦147956 and sisters¦147956, didn't God¦147961 chose¦147962 the poor in this world¦147967 to be rich in faith¦147972 and participants in the kingdom¦147977 which¦147978 he promises¦147979 to those who love him?
\v 6 But you dishonor¦147985 the poor, even though it's the wealthier people who oppress¦147992 you and bring court¦148000 cases against you.
\v 7 And aren't they¦148003 the ones who slander¦148004 the very God that you¦148011 pray to?
\s1 Judgement and mercy
\p
\v 8 However if you are obeying the golden law, then when you love your¦148024 neighbour¦148023 as yourself\x + \xo 2:8: \xt Lev 19:18.\x*you'll be doing¦148029 well according¦148018 to the scriptures¦148020.
\v 9 But if you're showing¦148032 favouritism¦148032, then you're all sinning by breaking the law.
\v 10 Because¦148043 anyone who tries to keep¦148048 the law but¦148053 slips up in one area, they're still guilty of breaking the law.
\v 11 The same \add God\add* who said, ‘Don't commit adultery,’ also said, ‘Don't murder,’\x + \xo 2:11: a \xt Exo 20:14; Deu 5:18; \xo b \xt Exo 20:13; Deu 5:17.\x*so if you're¦148076 not committing adultery but you murder someone, then you've broken the law.
\v 12 So speak¦148087 and¦148088 live your life knowing that you're going¦148095 to be judged¦148096 by the law that gives freedom¦148094,
\v 13 because judgement will be dispensed without mercy to those who haven't been putting mercy into practice. Yes, mercy wins out over judgement.

\p
\v 14 My¦148117 fellow¦148116 believers¦148116, what would I gain if I said that someone had faith but it didn't alter how they live their life? Faith like that wouldn't be able to save them.
\v 15 If a fellow believer is lacking¦148144 clothes or food,
\v 16 and one of you says to them, ‘Go in peace¦148161 and be warm and satisfied¦148165,’ but don't¦148167 help with their¦148173 physical needs, what use would that be?
\v 17 In other words, faith¦148181 without the corresponding lifestyle is just dead¦148187.
\p
\v 18 No doubt someone¦148193 will say, ‘Well you have the faith and I do the good deeds.’ So show me your¦148206 faith without¦148207 good deeds and I'll demonstrate my faith \em by\em* my good deeds.
\v 19 You believe that there's one God¦148231 and you're¦148234 right, but even the demons¦148237 believe that and shudder¦148240.
\v 20 But the vain person¦148246 still wants to know¦148244 if faith¦148250 without good deeds is wasted?
\v 21 Wasn't our¦148260 ancestor Abraham¦148257 considered right with God due to his \em actions\em* when he offered¦148265 up his son Isaac¦148266 on the altar¦148272?\x + \xo 2:21: \xt Gen 22:1-14.\x*
\v 22 So his faith was working¦148277 together¦148277 with his actions, and it was by his actions that his faith was perfected¦148288.
\v 23 This fulfilled¦148290 the scripture¦148292 that says, ‘Abraham¦148297 believed¦148295 in God and so he was consider to be right¦148304 with God, and was called¦148308 a friend¦148306 of God.’\x + \xo 2:23: a \xt Gen 15:6; \xo b \xt 2Ch 20:7; Isa 41:8.\x*
\v 24 So you can see that a person¦148316 is considered right with God due to his actions, and¦148317 not just by their ‘faith¦148320’.
\v 25 Similarly the prostitute¦148328 Rahab was made right by her¦148338 actions when she welcomed¦148333 the \add Hebrew\add* messengers¦148336 and¦148337 then helped them get away by a different route.\x + \xo 2:25: \xt Josh 2:1-21.\x*
\v 26 Just like a body¦148344 is dead once the spirit¦148346 has departed, so too faith¦148352 is dead if it's not demonstrated by good deeds.

\v 1 My¦148363 brothers¦148362 and¦148362 sisters¦148362, not everyone should desire to be a teacher because we¦148368 know that us teachers¦148360 will be judged more strictly.
\v 2 We all stumble in many ways¦148369. If there was someone who never said anything wrong, this person would be perfect¦148380 and also able to have self-control over their entire¦148372 body¦148388.
\v 3 With horses¦148395, we can put the bridle¦148397 in it's mouth¦148401 so we can make them do what we want, and so we can direct¦148416 the whole animal.
\v 4 Similarly, even huge ships¦148421 that are being driven¦148430 on by strong winds¦148428 are controlled by a small rudder¦148434 and¦148425 can be steered wherever¦148435 the captain desires.
\v 5 So too the tongue¦148447 is only small¦148448 but can make extensive claims.
\p Yes, a tiny flame can ignite an entire forest¦148460
\v 6 and the tongue is a fire producing a torrent of depravity. It's a part of our physical body¦148484 but capable of staining¦148481 us all over and setting¦148486 our worlds¦148467 on fire, because the tongue itself is set on fire from hell.
\v 7 Every kind of wild animal and birds¦148503 and reptiles¦148504 and sea¦148507 creature¦148507 can be tamed and has been tamed by mankind
\v 8 but¦148519 no one is able to tame the tongue¦148520—it's an erraticly evil¦148529 body part that's full of deadly¦148532 poison¦148531.
\v 9 We use it to bless¦148535 our master¦148537 and father¦148540, yet we use it to curse our fellow humans who are made in God's image.\x + \xo 3:9: \xt Gen 1:26.\x*
\v 10 Both blessings¦148558 and curses¦148560 come out of the same¦148555 mouth¦148556! My¦148564 brothers¦148563 and sisters¦148563, it shouldn't be like that.
\v 11 Surely¦148568 a spring¦148572 flowing out of a single cavity can't produce both good-tasting and¦148580 bitter¦148582 \add water\add*.
\v 12 A fig¦148587 tree¦148587 can't produce olives¦148589 and a grape vine¦148592 can't produce figs¦148593, my¦148586 brothers¦148585 and sisters¦148585, just like a salty supply can't give fresh water¦148603.

\v 2 You all have wants that are not fulfilled so it leads to murder¦148727. You're jealous¦148729 and not able to get everything you want, so you quarrel¦148734 and fight. You don't¦148725 have, because¦148741 you haven't asked \add God\add*,

\v 4 You're just like prostitutes. Don't you realise that if you befriend the world then you're opposing God, so anyone who befriends the world makes themself an enemy¦148789 of God.
\v 5 Do you¦148794 think that the scripture¦148799 means nothing when it¦148805 says, ‘\add God's\add* spirit¦148805 jealously longs to live in us’?
\v 6 However, he's good at giving grace so that's why it says, ‘God¦148818 opposes¦148820 proud¦148819 people but gives grace to humble¦148821 ones.’\x + \xo 4:6: \xt Prv 3:34 (LXX).\x*
\v 7 So strive then to do what God¦148828 wants of you. Resist the devil¦148832 and he will flee away from you.
\v 8 When you all approach God, he¦148841 will move closer to you. So keep your hands¦148845 clean you sinners¦148846, and keep your hearts¦148849 pure you who can't make up your minds about God.
\v 9 Be miserable¦148851, and mourn¦148853 and weep. Change your laughing¦148857 into crying and your happiness into sadness

\v 10 Look at the prophets¦149207 who spoke¦149209 out the messages from the master¦149213—they're good examples¦149193 of suffering and¦149202 patience¦149204 \add for you to follow\add*
\v 11 and now we consider them as heroes for their endurance. You all heard¦149222 about Yob's endurance and then you yourselves witnessed what happened to \add Yeshua our\add* master\x + \xo 5:11: a \xt Yob 1:21-22; 2:10; \xo b \xt Psa 103:8.\x*, and you saw his compassion and mercy.
\p
\v 12 But most importantly, brothers¦149239 and sisters¦149239, don't¦149241 swear¦149242 by heaven¦149245 or earth¦149248 or by any other¦149250 kind of oath but simply be honest so that ‘yes’ means yes and ‘no’ means no,\x + \xo 5:12: \xt Mat 5:34-37.\x*then you won't end up getting judged.

\v 13 Is anyone among¦149274 you¦149275 going through hard times? If so, they should be praying¦149276. Is anyone feeling cheerful¦149277? If so, they should be singing¦149281 praises¦149281.
\v 14 Is anyone¦149283 among¦149285 you¦149286 sick? If so, that person should call the leaders \add of the assembly¦149291\add* and get them to anoint¦149297 them with oil and to pray for them\x + \xo 5:14: \xt Mrk 6:13.\x*in the name¦149302 and authority of \add Yeshua our\add* master¦149304.
\v 15 Then that declaration of faith¦149309 will save the weak person and the master¦149317 will lift him/her up, and if they've sinned, then their sins¦149319 will also be forgiven¦149322.
\v 16 So confess¦149324 your¦149327 sins¦149329 to each other and¦149331 pray for each other so that all of you¦149337 can be healed¦149337, because¦149334 when an obedient believer prays, it has a real effect.
\v 17 Eliyah was a person just similar to us, and when he prayed¦149349 for the rain to stop, it stopped, and it didn't rain again for three¦149362 and a half years¦149360.\x + \xo 5:17: \xt 1Ki 17:1; 18:1.\x*
\v 18 Then he prayed¦149368 again, and the rain came down from the sky¦149371 and the land sprouted¦149379 and started to bear fruit¦149381 again.\x + \xo 5:18: \xt 1Ki 18:42-45.\x*

\v 19 My¦149384 fellow¦149383 believers¦149383, if any of you¦149388 have wandered from the truth¦149394 and¦149395 someone¦149397 helps them back,
\v 20 then you should know that someone who helps a sinner¦149405 to come back from their deceitful ways will be saving¦149410 their soul¦149412 from death¦149415,\x + \xo 5:20: \xt Prv 10:12; 1Pe 4:8.\x* and¦149417 their many sins¦149420 can be forgiven.
