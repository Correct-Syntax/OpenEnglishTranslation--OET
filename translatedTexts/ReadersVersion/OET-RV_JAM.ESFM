\is1 Introduction
\is2 Author
\ip The author of this letter is commonly known as ‘James’ in English translations, but most people don't realise that his English name should be Jacob (or Yakob if you wanted to be even closer to the original). This translation error can be traced all the way back to John Wycliffe's English translation from the Latin in the 1300's as he didn't have access to Greek New Testament manuscripts (although he did use Jacob in some parts of his New Testament when it referred to the son of Isaac). The confusion was probably due to changes in the way Latin was spoken over the centuries, and then translating the name from the historically-altered Latin instead of from the original Greek—see https://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/daily/biblical-topics/bible-versions-and-translations/james-or-jacob-in-the-bible for more details.
\ip Note from the first sentence in the letter that Jacob addressed the letter to the twelve tribes who originated from the twelve sons of his namesake.
\is2 This letter
\ip This \bk Letter from Jacob\bk* is Jacob's collection of advice to those who believe there is a God in heaven. He wrote this to all people scattered all around the world. Jacob used examples in order to explain his advice, so that their behaviour would improve and also their daily work. He also taught on various topics like: faith, testing, suffering, showing, respect, good behaviour, watching what you say, true wisdom from God, and prayer.
\ip He said that our faith is deficient if we don't also demonstrate it by our actions.

\v 1 \add This letter is from\add* Jacob¦147453, a slave¦147459 for God¦147454 and¦147455 for the master¦147456 Yeshua¦147457 the messiah¦147458. \add It's written\add* to the tribes¦147462 who have ended up dispersed¦147466 \add into many nations\add*:\x + \xo 1:1: \xt Mat 13:55; Mrk 6:3; Acts 15:13; Gal 1:19.\x* Greetings.
\s1 Gaining endurance and requesting wisdom
\p
\v 2 Be cheerful¦147469 my¦147472 fellow¦147471 believers¦147471, when you¦147475 face a range¦147476 of difficult situations,
\v 3 knowing¦147478 that you¦147482 will learn endurance¦147486 as your¦147482 faith¦147484 is tested.
\v 4 Let that endurance¦147489 do its¦147491 perfect work so that you¦147494 all might become perfect and¦147496 mature—not lacking¦147500 anything.
\p
\v 5 If anyone¦147503 of you is lacking¦147505 wisdom¦147506, then it should be requested¦147507 from God¦147513 who gives it generously¦147515 and without disparagement, and so it will be given¦147521 to you,
\v 6 but the person who's asking should demonstrate their faith¦147526 and not be doubting. That's because¦147530 a person who doubts is like a wave on the sea¦147534 that's just blown¦147535 and tossed¦147537 around
\v 7 and a person¦147542 like that shouldn't expect to get anything¦147546 from the master¦147550
\v 8 because that person is doubled-minded¦147552, and everything they attempt ends up in difficulty.
\s1 Behaviour of the poor and the wealthy
\p
\v 9 Those of humbler¦147564 means can boast¦147559 about their greatness
\v 10 whereas the wealthy¦147571 can boast about their weakness because¦147577 they'll pass away just like the daisies in the grass¦147580.\x + \xo 1:10-11: \xt Isa 40:6-7 (LXX).\x*
\v 11 When the sun¦147585 rises with its scorching¦147588 heat and withers¦147590 the grass¦147592, the flowers¦147595 will drop and lose all their beauty¦147600. So too for rich people who'll fade away right in the middle of all their projects.
\s1 Testing and temptation
\p
\v 12 Any person who's enduring¦147619 testing circumstances is fortunate, because¦147622 once they've passed the test, they'll receive¦147625 a crown¦147627 of life¦147629 that Yeshua promised¦147631 to those who love him¦147636.
\v 13 No one should say ‘It's God tempting me’ when they're being tempted, because God can't be tempted to do evil¦147651 and¦147653 he¦147654 doesn't tempt others,
\v 14 but rather they're being tempted¦147658 by their own lusts. They're being drawn¦147663 away and¦147664 enticed¦147665 \add into what they know is wrong\add*,
\v 15 and after the desire¦147668 is conceived¦147669 it leads to sin, and once the sin is concluded it leads to death¦147677.
\p
\v 16 Don't be led astray, my¦147681 dear brothers¦147680 and¦147680 sisters¦147680.
\v 17 Every¦147683 gift¦147688 that's good¦147685 and¦147686 perfect¦147689 comes from heaven. It comes down from the father¦147696 of lights¦147698, none of which are changing or casting moving shadows¦147708.
\v 18 Once he had decided it, he created us by his spoken commands so that we'd become a kind of special first¦147719 ‘harvest’ out of all of his creatures.
\s1 Listening then doing
\p
\v 19 So my¦147730 dear brothers¦147729 and sisters¦147729, note this: Everyone should be quick¦147738 to listen but slow to speak¦147745, and should be slow to get angry
\v 20 because¦147750 when people get very angry, it doesn't lead to the good behaviour that God¦147753 expects.
\v 21 So discard all \add moral\add* filth¦147760 and the evil¦147764 that's plentiful, and humbly accept the message¦147771 that's implanted¦147770 in you¦147777 all and which is capable of saving your¦147777 souls¦147776.
\p
\v 22 Don't delude¦147787 yourselves¦147788 by just listening¦147785 to the message¦147781, but put it into practice \add in your daily lives\add*.
\v 23 Anyone who is just a listener¦147792 of the message¦147793 and¦147795 does nothing with it is like someone who looks at their face¦147804 in a mirror¦147809
\v 24 but goes away after having a look and then immediately¦147816 forgets what they looked like.
\v 25 However the person who investigates¦147822 the perfect¦147825 law that gives freedom¦147828, and then sticks with it, not being just an observer that forgets¦147834 about it but rather a person who puts it into practice, this person will prosper in whatever they do.
\p
\v 26 If anyone¦147848 supposes¦147849 that they're religious but¦147861 doesn't guard what comes out of their mouth, then that person's religion is only skin deep and hasn't affected their heart¦147863.
\v 27 A person who wants to truly serve our¦147877 God¦147878 and father¦147881 with a pure heart would be visiting¦147884 orphans¦147885 and widows¦147887 in their¦147891 difficulties and staying unstained by worldly¦147899 ideas.
\c 2
\s1 Avoiding favouritism
\p
\v 1 My¦147901 dear brothers¦147900 and¦147900 sisters¦147900, as you live out your faith¦147907 in our¦147910 honoured master¦147909 Yeshua¦147911 the messiah¦147912, don't¦147902 show favouritism¦147904 to others.
\v 2 For \add example\add*, if a man in nicely cut clothes and wearing an expensive gold¦147923 ring came into to your¦147921 meeting as well as a poor man in filthy¦147932 clothes
\v 3 and you told the well-dressed one, ‘You sit here in this good¦147950 chair,’ while telling the poor man, ‘You stand¦147956 over here,’ or ‘You sit here on the mat,’
\v 4 wouldn't that discrimination show that you¦147972 have judged¦147977 them with evil¦147979 motives.
\v 5 Listen my¦147982 dear brothers¦147981 and sisters¦147981, didn't God¦147986 chose¦147987 the poor in this world¦147992 to be rich in faith¦147997 and participants in the kingdom¦148002 which¦148003 he promises¦148004 to those who love him?
\v 6 But you dishonor¦148010 the poor, even though it's the wealthier people who oppress¦148017 you and bring court¦148025 cases against you.
\v 7 And aren't they¦148028 the ones who slander¦148029 the very God that you¦148036 pray to?
\s1 Judgement and mercy
\p
\v 8 However if you are obeying the golden law, then when you love your¦148049 neighbour¦148048 as yourself¦148051\x + \xo 2:8: \xt Lev 19:18.\x* you'll be doing¦148054 well according¦148043 to the scriptures¦148045.
\v 9 But if you're showing¦148057 favouritism¦148057, then you're all sinning by breaking the law.
\v 10 Because¦148068 anyone who tries to keep¦148073 the law but¦148078 slips up in one area, they're still guilty of breaking the law.
\v 11 The same \add God\add* who said, ‘Don't commit adultery,’ also said, ‘Don't murder,’\x + \xo 2:11: a \xt Exo 20:14; Deu 5:18; \xo b \xt Exo 20:13; Deu 5:17.\x* so if you're¦148101 not committing adultery but you murder someone, then you've broken the law.
\v 12 So speak¦148112 and¦148113 live your life knowing that you're going¦148120 to be judged¦148121 by the law that gives freedom¦148119,
\v 13 because judgement will be dispensed without mercy to those who haven't been putting mercy into practice. Yes, mercy wins out over judgement.
\s1 Faith in action
\p
\v 14 My¦148142 fellow¦148141 believers¦148141, what would I gain if I said that someone had faith but it didn't alter how they live their life? Faith like that wouldn't be able to save them.
\v 15 If a fellow believer is lacking¦148169 clothes or food,
\v 16 and one of you says to them, ‘Go in peace¦148186 and be warm and satisfied¦148190,’ but don't¦148192 help with their¦148198 physical needs, what use would that be?
\v 17 In other words, faith¦148206 without the corresponding lifestyle is just dead¦148212.
\p
\v 18 No doubt someone¦148218 will say, ‘Well you have the faith and I do the good deeds.’ So show me your¦148231 faith without¦148232 good deeds and I'll demonstrate my faith \em by\em* my good deeds.
\v 19 You believe that there's one God¦148256 and you're¦148259 right, but even the demons¦148262 believe that and shudder¦148265.
\v 20 But the vain person¦148271 still wants to know¦148269 if faith¦148275 without good deeds is wasted?
\v 21 Wasn't our¦148285 ancestor Abraham¦148282 considered right with God due to his \em actions\em* when he offered¦148290 up his son Isaac¦148291 on the altar¦148297?\x + \xo 2:21: \xt Gen 22:1-14.\x*
\v 22 So his faith was working¦148302 together¦148302 with his actions, and it was by his actions that his faith was perfected¦148313.
\v 23 This fulfilled¦148315 the scripture¦148317 that says, ‘Abraham¦148322 believed¦148320 in God and so he was consider to be right¦148329 with God, and was called¦148333 a friend¦148331 of God.’\x + \xo 2:23: a \xt Gen 15:6; \xo b \xt 2Ch 20:7; Isa 41:8.\x*
\v 24 So you can see that a person¦148341 is considered right with God due to his actions, and¦148342 not just by their ‘faith¦148345’.
\v 25 Similarly the prostitute¦148353 Rahab was made right by her¦148363 actions when she welcomed¦148358 the \add Hebrew\add* messengers¦148361 and¦148362 then helped them get away by a different route.\x + \xo 2:25: \xt Josh 2:1-21.\x*
\v 26 Just like a body¦148369 is dead once the spirit¦148371 has departed, so too faith¦148377 is dead if it's not demonstrated by good deeds.
\c 3
\s1 The tongue
\p
\v 1 My¦148388 brothers¦148387 and¦148387 sisters¦148387, not everyone should desire to be a teacher because we¦148393 know that us teachers¦148385 will be judged more strictly.
\v 2 We all stumble in many ways¦148394. If there was someone who never said anything wrong, this person would be perfect¦148405 and also able to have self-control over their entire¦148397 body¦148413.
\v 3 With horses¦148420, we can put the bridle¦148422 in it's mouth¦148426 so we can make them do what we want, and so we can direct¦148441 the whole animal.
\v 4 Similarly, even huge ships¦148446 that are being driven¦148455 on by strong winds¦148453 are controlled by a small rudder¦148459 and¦148450 can be steered wherever¦148460 the captain desires.
\v 5 So too the tongue¦148472 is only small¦148473 but can make extensive claims.
\p Yes, a tiny flame can ignite an entire forest¦148485
\v 6 and the tongue is a fire producing a torrent of depravity. It's a part of our physical body¦148509 but capable of staining¦148506 us all over and setting¦148511 our worlds¦148492 on fire, because the tongue itself is set on fire from hell.
\v 7 Every kind of wild animal and birds¦148528 and reptiles¦148529 and sea¦148532 creature¦148532 can be tamed and has been tamed by mankind
\v 8 but¦148544 no one is able to tame the tongue¦148545—it's an erraticly evil¦148554 body part that's full of deadly¦148557 poison¦148556.
\v 9 We use it to bless¦148560 our master¦148562 and father¦148565, yet we use it to curse our fellow humans who are made in God's image.\x + \xo 3:9: \xt Gen 1:26.\x*
\v 10 Both blessings¦148583 and curses¦148585 come out of the same¦148580 mouth¦148581! My¦148589 brothers¦148588 and sisters¦148588, it shouldn't be like that.
\v 11 Surely¦148593 a spring¦148597 flowing out of a single cavity can't produce both good-tasting and¦148605 bitter¦148607 \add water\add*.
\v 12 A fig¦148612 tree¦148612 can't produce olives¦148614 and a grape vine¦148617 can't produce figs¦148618, my¦148611 brothers¦148610 and sisters¦148610, just like a salty supply can't give fresh water¦148628.
\s1 Heavenly wisdom
\p
\v 13 Any of you¦148634 that are wise and understanding¦148632 should demonstrate their good¦148638 deeds and wisdom¦148645 by their godly living.
\v 14 But if you are full of bitter¦148650 jealousy¦148649 or selfish¦148653 ambition¦148653, don't¦148660 be boasting¦148662 or denying the truth¦148667
\v 15 because none of that came down to you from heaven, but¦148678 on the contrary it's earthly¦148679 and soulish¦148680 and demonic¦148681.
\v 16 Wherever you find jealousy¦148684 and selfish¦148686 ambition¦148686, you'll also find disharmony and all kinds of evil¦148693.
\v 17 In contrast, the wisdom¦148698 that comes from God is pure, peaceable¦148704, gentle¦148705, compliant¦148706, full of mercy¦148708 and good¦148712 behaviour, unceasing¦148713, and not hypocritical.
\v 18 Those who desire peace sow \add the seeds\add* that will produce godly behaviour.
\c 4
\s1 Don't befriend the world
\p
\v 1 Where do you imagine that the fights and quarrels¦148733 among¦148734 you all originate? Isn't it¦148736 because of the ambitions that surface inside you?
\v 2 You all have wants that are not fulfilled so it leads to murder¦148752. You're jealous¦148754 and not able to get everything you want, so you quarrel¦148759 and fight. You don't¦148750 have, because¦148766 you haven't asked \add God\add*,
\v 3 and when you all do ask, it¦148785 doesn't get answered because¦148775 you ask with wrong¦148776 \add motives\add*—trying get what you want to spend¦148785 on your¦148783 own wants.
\v 4 You're just like prostitutes. Don't you realise that if you befriend the world then you're opposing God, so whoever befriends the world makes themself an enemy¦148814 of God.
\v 5 Do you¦148819 think that the scripture¦148824 means nothing when it¦148830 says, ‘\add God's\add* spirit¦148830 jealously longs to live in us’?
\v 6 However, he's good at giving grace so that's why it says, ‘God¦148843 opposes¦148845 proud¦148844 people but gives grace to humble¦148846 ones.’\x + \xo 4:6: \xt Prv 3:34 (LXX).\x*
\v 7 So strive then to do what God¦148853 wants of you. Resist the devil¦148857 and he will flee away from you.
\v 8 When you all approach God, he¦148866 will move closer to you. So keep your hands¦148870 clean you sinners¦148871, and keep your hearts¦148874 pure you who can't make up your minds about God.
\v 9 Be miserable¦148876, and mourn¦148878 and weep. Change your laughing¦148882 into crying and your happiness into sadness
\v 10 because when you humble¦148893 yourselves towards the master¦148897, he will be the one to lift you up.
\s1 Avoid judging others
\p
\v 11 My fellow believers¦148904, don't¦148926 make false accusations against each other because whoever falsely accuses or judges a fellow believer, is slandering against the law and judging it. But if you're the ones judging the law, then you're not a follower of the law but a judge of it.
\v 12 There's only one lawgiver¦148935 and judge and that's the one who is able to save and to destroy¦148942. So who do you think you are to judge your neighbour¦148952!
\s1 Avoid boasting and presumption
\p
\v 13 Now you¦148956 all might say, ‘Today¦148958 or tomorrow¦148961 we'll go into the city¦148967 to work there¦148971 for a year¦148972 and do some trading to make some money.’\x + \xo 4:13-14: \xt Prv 27:1.\x*
\v 14 But you don't¦148981 know what tomorrow will bring, because¦148988 what are your¦148991 lives? You're like a vapour¦148992 that appears¦149000 for a brief period and then it's gone.
\v 15 So instead of saying¦149007 that, you¦149008 should say, ‘If the master¦149011 wants it, we will live and we'll do this or that.’
\v 16 But as it is, you've all been boasting in your¦149031 arrogance¦149030 and that's an evil¦149036 attitude.
\v 17 Any person who knows that there's some good¦149040 thing that they should be doing, but doesn't do it, is sinning.
\c 5
\s1 The bad ending of wealthy prigs
\p
\v 1 So you wealthy¦149053 people, come¦149049 and cry about the miseries¦149058 that are about to hit you all.
\v 2 Your¦149065 riches¦149064 have rotted¦149066 and¦149067 your¦149065 clothes¦149069 have become¦149072 moth-eaten¦149071.\x + \xo 5:2-3: \xt Mat 6:19.\x*
\v 3 Your¦149075 gold¦149074 and silver¦149079 has corroded, and that corrosion will speak out against you and will eat away your¦149075 bodies like fire¦149098 because¦149085 you stored¦149099 up wealth in this final age.
\v 4 The unpaid wages of the workers¦149108 who harvested¦149110 your¦149113 fields¦149112 are crying¦149119 out\x + \xo 5:4: \xt Deu 24:14-15.\x* and¦149120 the desperate requests of those harvesters have been heard by the master¦149128 of platoons of angels.
\v 5 You have indulged¦149133 yourselves and lived¦149139 luxuriously¦149139 but you've been fattening yourselves up as the time for your¦149143 slaughter¦149148 approaches.
\v 6 You all convicted¦149149 innocent people and had them executed, even when they weren't doing anything against¦149155 you.
\s1 Wait patiently
\p
\v 7 So my fellow¦149158 believers¦149158, be patient until the return of \add Yeshua our\add* master¦149163. You see how farmers¦149166 look forward to the fruit¦149170 to be ready—waiting patiently even while they monitor the early¦149183 and¦149184 the late rains¦149185.
\v 8 All of you should be patient¦149186 too, and encourage each other \add in your¦149193 faith\add* because¦149194 the master's¦149198 return is closer now.
\p
\v 9 And don't¦149208 moan about each other, my fellow¦149202 believers¦149202, so that you¦149209 all won't be judged¦149209 for it, because truly, the judge¦149213 is just outside about to come in the doors¦149216.
\v 10 Look at the prophets¦149232 who spoke¦149234 out the messages from the master¦149238—they're good examples¦149218 of suffering and¦149227 patience¦149229 \add for you to follow\add*
\v 11 and now we consider them as heroes for their endurance. You all heard¦149247 about Job's endurance and then you yourselves witnessed what happened to \add Yeshua our\add* master\x + \xo 5:11: a \xt Job 1:21-22; 2:10; \xo b \xt Psa 103:8.\x*, and you saw his compassion and mercy.
\p
\v 12 But most importantly, brothers¦149264 and sisters¦149264, don't¦149266 swear¦149267 by heaven¦149270 or earth¦149273 or by any other¦149275 kind of oath but simply be honest so that ‘yes’ means yes and ‘no’ means no,\x + \xo 5:12: \xt Mat 5:34-37.\x* then you won't end up getting judged.
\s1 The power of prayer and¦149264 restoration

\v 13 Is anyone among¦149299 you¦149300 going through hard times? If so, they should be praying¦149301. Is anyone feeling cheerful¦149302? If so, they should be singing¦149306 praises¦149306.
\v 14 Is anyone¦149308 among¦149310 you¦149311 sick? If so, that person should call the leaders \add of the assembly¦149316\add* and get them to anoint¦149322 them with oil and to pray for them\x + \xo 5:14: \xt Mrk 6:13.\x* in the name¦149327 and authority of \add Yeshua our\add* master¦149329.
\v 15 Then that declaration of faith¦149334 will save the weak person and the master¦149342 will lift him/her up, and if they've sinned, then their sins¦149344 will also be forgiven¦149347.
\v 16 So confess¦149349 your¦149352 sins¦149354 to each other and¦149356 pray for each other so that all of you¦149362 can be healed¦149362, because¦149359 when an obedient believer prays, it has a real effect.
\v 17 Elijah was a person just similar to us, and when he prayed¦149374 for the rain to stop, it stopped, and it didn't rain again for three¦149387 and a half years¦149385.\x + \xo 5:17: \xt 1Ki 17:1; 18:1.\x*
\v 18 Then he prayed¦149393 again, and the rain came down from the sky¦149396 and the land sprouted¦149404 and started to bear fruit¦149406 again.\x + \xo 5:18: \xt 1Ki 18:42-45.\x*

\v 19 My¦149409 fellow¦149408 believers¦149408, if any of you¦149413 have wandered from the truth¦149419 and¦149420 someone¦149422 helps them back,
\v 20 then you should know that someone who helps a sinner¦149430 to come back from their deceitful ways will be saving¦149435 their soul¦149437 from death¦149440,\x + \xo 5:20: \xt Prv 10:12; 1Pe 4:8.\x* and¦149442 their many sins¦149445 can be forgiven.
