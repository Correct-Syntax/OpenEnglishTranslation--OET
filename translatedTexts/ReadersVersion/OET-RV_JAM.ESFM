\is1 Introduction
\is2 Author
\ip The author of this letter is commonly known as ‘James’ in English translations, but most people don't realise that his English name should be Yacob (or Yakob if you wanted to be even closer to the original). This translation error can be traced all the way back to Yohan Wycliffe's English translation from the Latin in the 1300's as he didn't have access to Greek New Testament manuscripts (although he did use Yacob in some parts of his New Testament when it referred to the son of Isaac). The confusion was probably due to changes in the way Latin was spoken over the centuries, and then translating the name from the historically-altered Latin instead of from the original Greek—see https://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/daily/biblical-topics/bible-versions-and-translations/james-or-Yacob-in-the-bible for more details.
\ip Note from the first sentence in the letter that Yacob addressed the letter to the twelve tribes who originated from the twelve sons of his namesake.
\is2 This letter
\ip This \bk Letter from Yacob\bk* is Yacob's collection of advice to those who believe there is a God in heaven. He wrote this to all people scattered all around the world. Yacob used examples in order to explain his advice, so that their behaviour would improve and also their daily work. He also taught on various topics like: faith, testing, suffering, showing, respect, good behaviour, watching what you say, true wisdom from God, and prayer.
\ip He said that our faith is deficient if we don't also demonstrate it by our actions.

\rem /s1 Faith under trial
\p
\v 2 Be cheerful¦147445 my¦147448 fellow¦147447 believers¦147447, when you¦147451 face a range¦147452 of difficult situations,
\v 3 knowing¦147454 that you¦147458 will learn endurance¦147462 as your¦147458 faith¦147460 is tested.
\v 4 Let that endurance¦147465 do its¦147467 perfect work so that you¦147470 all might become perfect and¦147472 mature—not lacking¦147476 anything.
\p
\v 5 If anyone¦147479 of you is lacking¦147481 wisdom¦147482, then it should¦147483 be requested¦147483 from \nd God¦147489\nd* who gives it generously¦147491 and without disparagement, and so it will be given¦147497 to you,
\v 6 but¦147500 the person who's asking should¦147499 demonstrate their faith¦147502 and not be doubting. That's because¦147506 a person who doubts is like a wave on the sea¦147510 that's just blown¦147511 and tossed¦147513 around
\v 7 and a person¦147518 like that shouldn't expect to get anything¦147522 from the \nd master¦147526\nd*
\rem /s1 Poverty and Riches
\v 8 because that person is doubled-minded¦147528, and everything they attempt ends up in difficulty.
\s1 Behaviour of the poor and the wealthy
\p
\v 9 Those of humbler¦147540 means can boast¦147535 about their greatness
\v 10 whereas the wealthy¦147547 can boast about their weakness because¦147553 they'll pass away just like the daisies in the grass¦147556.\x + \xo 1:10-11: \xt Isa 40:6-7 (LXX).\x*
\v 11 When the sun¦147561 rises with its scorching¦147564 heat and withers¦147566 the grass¦147568, the flowers¦147571 will drop and lose all their beauty¦147576. So too for rich people who'll fade away right in the middle of all their projects.
\s1 Testing and temptation
\rem /s1 Trial and Temptation
\rem /s1 Testing and Tempting
\p
\v 12 Any person who's enduring¦147595 testing circumstances is fortunate, because¦147598 once they've passed the test, they'll receive¦147601 a crown¦147603 of life¦147605 that Yeshua promised¦147607 to those who love him¦147612.
\v 13 No one should¦147615 say ‘It's God tempting me’ when they're being tempted, because¦147623 God can't be tempted to do evil¦147627 and he doesn't tempt others,
\v 14 but¦147633 rather they're being tempted¦147634 by their own lusts. They're being drawn¦147639 away and¦147640 enticed¦147641 \add into what they know is wrong\add*,
\v 15 and after the desire¦147644 is conceived¦147645 it leads to sin, and once the sin is concluded it leads to death¦147653.
\p
\v 16 Don't be led astray, my¦147657 dear brothers¦147656 and¦147656 sisters¦147656.
\v 17 Every¦147659 gift¦147664 that's good¦147661 and¦147662 perfect¦147665 comes from heaven. It comes down from the father¦147672 of lights¦147674, none of which are changing or casting moving shadows¦147684.
\v 18 Once he had decided it, he created us by his spoken commands so that we'd become a kind of special first¦147695 ‘harvest’ out of all of his creatures.
\s1 Listening then doing

\rem /s1 Hearing and Doing the Word
\rem /s1 Listening and Doing
\p
\v 19 So my¦147706 dear brothers¦147705 and sisters¦147705, note this: Everyone should be quick¦147714 to listen¦147717 but¦147711 slow to speak¦147721, and should be slow to get angry
\v 20 because¦147726 when people get very angry, it doesn't lead to the good behaviour that \nd God¦147729\nd* expects.
\v 21 So¦147733 discard all \add moral\add* filth¦147736 and the evil¦147740 that's plentiful, and humbly accept the message¦147747 that's implanted¦147746 in you¦147753 all and which is capable of saving your¦147753 souls¦147752.
\p
\v 22 Don't delude¦147763 yourselves¦147764 by just listening¦147761 to the message¦147757, but put it into practice \add in your daily lives\add*.
\v 23 Anyone who is just a listener¦147768 of the message¦147769 and¦147771 does nothing with it is like someone who looks at their face¦147780 in a mirror¦147785
\v 24 but goes away after having a look and then immediately¦147792 forgets what they looked like.
\v 25 However the person who investigates¦147798 the perfect¦147801 law that gives freedom¦147804, and then sticks with it, not being just an observer that forgets¦147810 about it but¦147797 rather a person who puts it into practice, this person will prosper in whatever they do.
\p
\v 26 If anyone¦147824 supposes¦147825 that they're religious but¦147837 doesn't guard what comes out of their mouth, then that person's religion is only skin deep and hasn't affected their heart¦147839.
\v 27 A person who wants to truly serve our¦147853 \nd God¦147854\nd* and father¦147857 with a pure heart would be visiting¦147860 orphans¦147861 and widows¦147863 in their¦147867 difficulties and staying unstained by worldly¦147875 ideas.

\s1 Avoiding favouritism
\rem /s1 Warning against Partiality
\rem /s1 A Warning against Prejudice
\rem /s1 Favouritism Forbidden
\rem /s1 Warning against Prejudice
\rem /s1 Love your neighbour as yourself
\p
\v 1 My¦147877 dear brothers¦147876 and¦147876 sisters¦147876, as you live out your faith¦147883 in our¦147886 honoured \nd master¦147885 Yeshua¦147887\nd* the \nd messiah¦147888\nd*, don't¦147878 show favouritism¦147880 to others.
\v 2 For \add example\add*, if a man in nicely cut clothes and wearing an expensive gold¦147899 ring came into to your¦147897 meeting as well as a poor man in filthy¦147908 clothes
\v 3 and you told the well-dressed one, ‘You sit here in this good¦147926 chair,’ while telling the poor man, ‘You stand¦147932 over here,’ or ‘You sit here on the mat,’
\v 4 wouldn't that discrimination show that you¦147948 have judged¦147953 them with evil¦147955 motives.
\v 5 Listen my¦147958 dear brothers¦147957 and sisters¦147957, didn't \nd God¦147962\nd* chose¦147963 the poor in this world¦147968 to be rich in faith¦147973 and participants in the kingdom¦147978 which¦147979 he promises¦147980 to those who love him?
\v 6 But you dishonour¦147986 the poor, even though it's the wealthier people who oppress¦147993 you and bring court¦148001 cases against you.
\v 7 And aren't they¦148004 the ones who slander¦148005 the very God that you¦148012 pray to?
\s1 Judgement and mercy
\p
\v 8 However if you are obeying the golden law, then when you love your¦148025 neighbour¦148024 as yourself¦148027,\x + \xo 2:8: \xt Lev 19:18.\x* you'll be doing¦148030 well according¦148019 to the scriptures¦148021.
\v 9 But if you're showing¦148033 favouritism¦148033, then you're all sinning by breaking the law.
\v 10 Because¦148044 anyone¦148056 who tries to keep¦148049 the law but¦148054 slips up in one area, they're still guilty of breaking the law.
\v 11 The same \add God\add* who said, ‘Don't commit adultery,’ also said, ‘Don't murder,’\x + \xo 2:11: a \xt Exo 20:14; Deu 5:18; \xo b \xt Exo 20:13; Deu 5:17.\x* so if you're¦148077 not committing adultery but you murder someone, then you've broken the law.
\v 12 So speak¦148088 and¦148089 live your life knowing that you're going¦148096 to be judged¦148097 by the law that gives freedom¦148095,
\v 13 because¦148099 judgement will be dispensed without mercy to those who haven't been putting mercy into practice. Yes, mercy wins out over judgement.

\p
\v 14 My¦148118 fellow¦148117 believers¦148117, what would I gain if I said that someone had faith but it didn't alter how they live their life? Faith like that wouldn't be able to save them.
\v 15 If a fellow believer is lacking¦148145 clothes or food,
\v 16 and one of you says to them, ‘Go in peace¦148162 and be warm and satisfied¦148166,’ but don't¦148168 help with their¦148174 physical needs, what use would that be?
\v 17 In other words, faith¦148182 without the corresponding lifestyle is just dead¦148188.
\p
\v 18 No doubt someone¦148194 will say, ‘Well you have the faith and I do the good deeds.’ So show me your¦148207 faith without¦148208 good deeds and I'll demonstrate my faith \em by\em* my good deeds.
\v 19 You believe that there's one \nd God¦148232\nd* and you're¦148235 right, but even the demons¦148238 believe that and shudder¦148241.
\v 20 But the vain person¦148247 still wants to know¦148245 if faith¦148251 without good deeds is wasted?
\v 21 Wasn't our¦148261 ancestor Abraham¦148258 considered right with God due to his \em actions\em* when he offered¦148266 up his son Isaac¦148267 on the altar¦148273?\x + \xo 2:21: \xt Gen 22:1-14.\x*
\v 22 So his faith was working¦148278 together¦148278 with his actions, and it was by his actions that his faith was perfected¦148289.
\v 23 This fulfilled¦148291 the scripture¦148293 that says, ‘Abraham¦148298 believed¦148296 in God and so he was consider to be right¦148305 with God, and was called¦148309 a friend¦148307 of God.’\x + \xo 2:23: a \xt Gen 15:6; \xo b \xt 2Ch 20:7; Isa 41:8.\x*
\v 24 So you can see that a person¦148317 is considered right with God due to his actions, and¦148318 not just by their ‘faith¦148321’.
\v 25 Similarly the prostitute¦148329 Rahab was made right by her actions when she welcomed¦148334 the \add Hebrew\add* messengers¦148337 and¦148338 then helped them get away by a different route.\x + \xo 2:25: \xt Josh 2:1-21.\x*
\v 26 Just like a body¦148345 is dead once the spirit¦148347 has departed, so too faith¦148353 is dead if it's not demonstrated by good deeds.

\v 1 My¦148364 brothers¦148363 and¦148363 sisters¦148363, not everyone should desire to be a teacher because we¦148369 know that us teachers¦148361 will be judged more strictly.
\v 2 We all stumble in many ways¦148370. If there was someone who never said anything wrong, this person would be perfect¦148381 and also able to have self-control over their entire¦148373 body¦148389.
\v 3 With horses¦148396, we can put the bridle¦148398 in it's mouth¦148402 so we can make them do what we want, and so we can direct¦148417 the whole animal.
\v 4 Similarly, even huge ships¦148422 that are being driven¦148431 on by strong winds¦148429 are controlled by a small rudder¦148435 and¦148426 can be steered wherever¦148436 the captain desires.
\v 5 So too the tongue¦148448 is only small¦148449 but can make extensive claims.
\p Yes, a tiny flame can ignite an entire forest¦148461
\v 6 and the tongue is a fire producing a torrent of depravity. It's a part of our physical body¦148485 but capable of staining¦148482 us all over and setting¦148487 our worlds¦148468 on fire, because the tongue itself is set on fire from hell.
\v 7 Every kind of wild animal and birds¦148504 and reptiles¦148505 and sea¦148508 creature¦148508 can be tamed and has been tamed by mankind
\v 8 but¦148520 no one is able to tame the tongue¦148521—it's an erratically evil¦148530 body part that's full of deadly¦148533 poison¦148532.
\v 9 We use it to bless¦148536 our \nd master¦148538\nd* and father¦148541, yet we use it to curse our fellow humans who are made in God's image.\x + \xo 3:9: \xt Gen 1:26.\x*
\v 10 Both blessings¦148559 and curses¦148561 come out of the same¦148556 mouth¦148557! My¦148565 brothers¦148564 and sisters¦148564, it shouldn't be like that.
\v 11 Surely¦148569 a spring¦148573 flowing out of a single cavity can't produce both good-tasting and¦148581 bitter¦148583 \add water\add*.
\v 12 A fig¦148588 tree¦148588 can't produce olives¦148590 and a grape vine¦148593 can't produce figs¦148594, my¦148587 brothers¦148586 and sisters¦148586, just like a salty supply can't give fresh water¦148604.

\v 1 Where do you imagine that the fights and quarrels¦148709 among¦148710 you all originate? Isn't it¦148712 because of the ambitions that surface inside you?
\v 2 You all have wants that are not fulfilled so it leads to murder¦148728. You're jealous¦148730 and not able to get everything you want, so you quarrel¦148735 and fight. You don't¦148726 have, because¦148742 you haven't asked \add God\add*,

\v 4 You're just like prostitutes. Don't you realise that if you befriend the world then you're opposing God, so anyone who befriends the world makes themself an enemy¦148790 of God.
\v 5 Do you¦148795 think that the scripture¦148800 means nothing when it says, ‘\add God's\add* \nd spirit¦148806\nd* jealously longs to live in us’?
\v 6 However, he's good at giving grace so that's why it says, ‘\nd God¦148819\nd* opposes¦148821 proud¦148820 people but¦148813 gives grace to humble¦148822 ones.’\x + \xo 4:6: \xt Prv 3:34 (LXX).\x*
\v 7 So¦148827 strive then to do what \nd God¦148829\nd* wants of you. Resist the devil¦148833 and he will flee away from you.
\v 8 When you all approach God, he will move closer to you. So keep your hands¦148846 clean you sinners¦148847, and keep your hearts¦148850 pure you who can't make up your minds about God.

\v 7 So¦149133 my fellow¦149134 believers¦149134, be patient until the return of \add Yeshua our\add* \nd master¦149139\nd*. You see how farmers¦149142 look forward to the fruit¦149146 to be ready—waiting patiently even while they monitor the early¦149159 and¦149160 the late rains¦149161.
\v 8 All of you should be patient¦149162 too, and encourage each other \add in your¦149169 faith\add* because¦149170 the \nd master's¦149174\nd* return is closer now.
\p
\v 9 And don't¦149184 moan about each other, my fellow¦149178 believers¦149178, so that you¦149185 all won't be judged¦149185 for it, because truly, the judge¦149189 is just outside about to come in the doors¦149192.
\v 10 Look at the prophets¦149208 who spoke¦149210 out the messages from the \nd master¦149214\nd*—they're good examples¦149194 of suffering and¦149203 patience¦149205 \add for you to follow\add*
\v 11 and now we consider them as heroes for their endurance. You all heard¦149223 about Yob's endurance and then you yourselves witnessed what happened to \add Yeshua our\add* master,\x + \xo 5:11: a \xt Yob 1:21-22; 2:10; \xo b \xt Psa 103:8.\x* and you saw his compassion and mercy.
\p
\v 12 But most importantly, brothers¦149240 and sisters¦149240, don't¦149242 swear¦149243 by heaven¦149246 or earth¦149249 or by any other¦149251 kind of oath but simply be honest so that ‘yes’ means yes and ‘no’ means no,\x + \xo 5:12: \xt Mat 5:34-37.\x* then you won't end up getting judged.

\rem /s1 The Power of Prayer
\p
\v 13 Is anyone among¦149275 you¦149276 going through hard times? If so, they should be praying¦149277. Is anyone feeling cheerful¦149278? If so, they should be singing¦149282 praises¦149282.
\v 14 Is anyone¦149284 among¦149286 you¦149287 sick? If so, that person should¦149288 call the leaders \add of the assembly¦149292\add* and get them to anoint¦149298 them with oil and to pray for them\x + \xo 5:14: \xt Mrk 6:13.\x* in the name¦149303 and authority of \add Yeshua our\add* \nd master¦149305\nd*.
\v 15 Then that declaration of faith¦149310 will save the weak person and the \nd master¦149318\nd* will lift him/her up, and if they've sinned, then their sins¦149320 will also be forgiven¦149323.
\v 16 So¦149326 confess¦149325 your¦149328 sins¦149330 to each other and¦149332 pray for each other so that all of you¦149338 can be healed¦149338, because¦149335 when an obedient believer prays, it has a real effect.
\v 17 Eliyah was a person just similar to us, and when he prayed¦149350 for the rain to stop, it stopped, and it didn't rain again for three¦149363 and a half years¦149361.\x + \xo 5:17: \xt 1Ki 17:1; 18:1.\x*
\v 18 Then he prayed¦149369 again, and the rain came down from the sky¦149372 and the land sprouted¦149380 and started to bear fruit¦149382 again.\x + \xo 5:18: \xt 1Ki 18:42-45.\x*
\rem /s1 Restore Wandering Believers
\p
\v 19 My¦149385 fellow¦149384 believers¦149384, if any of you¦149389 have wandered from the truth¦149395 and¦149396 someone¦149398 helps them back,
\v 20 then you should know that someone who helps a sinner¦149406 to come back from their deceitful ways will be saving¦149411 their soul¦149413 from death¦149416,\x + \xo 5:20: \xt Prv 10:12; 1Pe 4:8.\x* and¦149418 their many sins¦149421 can be forgiven.
