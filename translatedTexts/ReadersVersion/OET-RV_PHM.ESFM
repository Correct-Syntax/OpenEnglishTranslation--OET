\v 4 I'm always thanking my God and mentioning you in my prayers

\v 8 Therefore, with the help of the messiah, I would be brave enough to tell you what you need to do,
\v 9 but because of love as Paul, an older man and now also a prisoner for Yeshua the messiah, I'm just going to encourage you to do it.
\v 10 \x + \xo 10: \xt Col 4:9.\x*So I'm going to encourage you concerning Onesimus who became my \add spiritual\add* ‘son’ since I've been imprisoned.
\v 11 Before he was useless to you, but now he's useful to both of us.
\p
\v 12  I sent him to you (even though in my heart
\v 13 I wanted to keep him \add here\add*) so that he might be serving me \add here due to\add* the bonds of the good message
\v 14 but I didn't want to do anything without \add hearing\add* your opinion, so that you're not doing good because you have to, but rather because you want to.

\v 17 Therefore, if you consider me as your partner, accept him like you'd accept me,
\v 18 but if he did anything wrong to you or owes you anything, charge it to me.
\v 19 I, Paul, wrote this bit in my own handwriting. I will pay back anything \add he owes you\add*, then I won't need to be reminding you that you \add pretty much\add* owe yourself to me.
\v 20 Yes, brother, \add with both of us being\add* in the master, I might \add hopefully\add* benefit from you—refresh my heart in \add the\add* messiah.
