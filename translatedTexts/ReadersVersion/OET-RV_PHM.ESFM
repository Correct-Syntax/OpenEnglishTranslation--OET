\mt2 Paul's letter to
\mt1 Philemon
\is1 Introduction
\ip Philemon was known to be a follower of Yeshua and he was a member of a group of believers in the city of Colossas. He was the owner of a slave named Onesimus. Onesimus had fled from his master and eventually met Paul the missionary in prison in Rome. It was there that Onesimus became a believer in Yeshua because of Paul's sharing of the good message. Here in \bk Paul's letter to Philemon\bk*, Paul requests that the good relationship be restored between Philemon and his slave, Onesimus. Because Paul sent Onesimus back to Philemon, he wanted Philemon to take his slave back in, not just because he'd forgiven his slave, but also because his slave was now a fellow believer and hence his brother.

\v 4 \add Philemon,\add* I'm always¦141585 thanking¦141581 my \nd God¦141583\nd* and mentioning¦141586 you¦141587 in my prayers¦141591
\v 5 \add after\add* hearing¦141593 your faith¦141599 and about your love¦141596 for the \nd master¦141605\nd* \nd Yeshua¦141606\nd* and for all the believers.
\v 6 \add I pray that\add* the fellowship¦141614 of your¦141617 faith¦141616 may become¦141619 active¦141618 in the knowledge¦141621 of every¦141622 good¦141623 thing¦141623 in us toward¦141628 \add the\add* \nd messiah¦141629\nd*. [WHAT DOES THAT MEAN???]
\v 7 Because¦141633 I was very happy and encouraged by your¦141642 love¦141641, because¦141643 the hearts¦141645 of the believers have been refreshed¦141648 by you, brother¦141651.

\p
\v 8 Therefore¦141652, with the help of the \nd messiah¦141655\nd*, I would be brave enough to tell you what you need to do,
\v 9 but because¦141662 of love¦141665 as Paul¦141671, an older¦141672 man¦141672 and¦141675 now also a prisoner¦141677 for \nd Yeshua¦141679\nd* the \nd messiah¦141678\nd*, I'm just going to encourage you¦141667 to do it.
\v 10 \x + \xo 10: \xt Col 4:9.\x*So I'm going to encourage you¦141682 concerning Onesimus who became my \add spiritual\add* ‘son’ since I've been imprisoned.
\v 11 Before he was useless¦141698 to you, but now he's useful¦141705 to both of us.
\p
\v 12 I sent¦141707 him¦141711 to you¦141709 (even though in my heart¦141716
\v 13 I wanted to keep him \add here\add*) so that he might be serving¦141729 me \add here due to\add* the bonds¦141733 of the good¦141735 message¦141735
\v 14 but I didn't want to do anything without \add hearing\add* your¦141751 opinion¦141740, so that you're not doing good¦141750 because you have to, but rather because you want to.
\p
\v 15 It was possibly¦141756 because¦141758 of that that he¦141760 was separated¦141760 \add from you\add* for a while, so that on the eternal¦141764 \add scale\add* you could fully¦141766 accept him¦141765,
\v 16 no longer¦141767 as a slave but better than a slave—a dear brother to me most of you but preferably \add also\add* to you—a brother in the body and in the \nd master¦141786\nd*.
\p
\v 17 Therefore¦141788, if you consider me as your partner¦141792, accept him¦141794 like you'd accept me,
\v 18 but if he¦141801 did anything wrong¦141801 to you or owes you anything, charge it to me.
\v 19 \sig I, Paul¦141811, wrote¦141812 this bit in my own handwriting. I will pay back anything \+add he¦141813 owes you\+add*, then I won't need to be reminding you that you \add pretty much\add* owe yourself¦141824 to me.\sig*
\v 20 \sig Yes, brother¦141830, \+add with both of us being\+add* in the \+nd master¦141835\+nd*, I might¦141833 \+add hopefully\+add* benefit¦141833 from you¦141832—refresh¦141836 my¦141837 heart¦141839 in \+add the\+add* \+nd messiah¦141841\+nd*.\sig*
\p
\v 21 \sig I wrote¦141847 to you because I was sure that you'd obey \+add my request\+add*, in fact knowing¦141849 that you'd do even more than what I ask.\sig*
\s1 Paul's final greetings
\p
\v 22 \sig \+add Go ahead and\+add* prepare¦141860 somewhere for me to stay because¦141864 I'm hoping¦141863 that I'll be able to visit \+add thanks\+add* to you all praying \+add for me\+add*.\sig*
