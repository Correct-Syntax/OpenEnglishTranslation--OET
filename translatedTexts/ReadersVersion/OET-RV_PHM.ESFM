\mt2 Paul's letter to
\mt1 Philemon
\is1 Introduction
\ip Philemon was known to be a follower of Yeshua and he was a member of a group of believers in the city of Colossas. He was the owner of a slave named Onesimus. Onesimus had fled from his master and eventually met Paul the missionary in prison in Rome. It was there that Onesimus became a believer in Yeshua because of Paul's sharing of the good message. Here in \bk Paul's letter to Philemon\bk*, Paul requests that the good relationship be restored between Philemon and his slave, Onesimus. Because Paul sent Onesimus back to Philemon, he wanted Philemon to take his slave back in, not just because he'd forgiven his slave, but also because his slave was now a fellow believer and hence his brother.

\v 2 \x + \xo 2: \xt Col 4:17.\x*as well as \add our\add* sister¦141557 Apphia and our fellow-soldier¦141562 Archippus and to the assembly¦141569 \add that meets\add* in your¦141568 home.
\v 3 \add May you¦141571 all experience\add* grace¦141570 and peace¦141573 from our¦141577 father¦141576 \nd God¦141575\nd* and from the \nd master¦141579\nd*, \nd Yeshua¦141580\nd* \add the\add* \nd messiah¦141581\nd*.

\v 4 \add Philemon,\add* I'm always¦141586 thanking¦141582 my \nd God¦141584\nd* and mentioning¦141587 you¦141588 in my prayers¦141592
\v 5 \add after\add* hearing¦141594 your faith¦141600 and about your love¦141597 for the \nd master¦141606 Yeshua¦141607\nd* and for all the believers.
\v 6 \add I pray that\add* the fellowship¦141615 of your¦141618 faith¦141617 may become¦141620 active¦141619 in the knowledge¦141622 of every¦141623 good¦141624 thing in us toward¦141629 \add the\add* \nd messiah¦141630\nd*. [WHAT DOES THAT MEAN???]
\v 7 Because I was very happy and encouraged by your¦141643 love¦141642, because¦141644 the hearts¦141646 of the believers have been refreshed¦141649 by you, brother¦141652.

\p
\v 8 Therefore¦141653, with the help of the \nd messiah¦141656\nd*, I would be brave enough to tell you what you need to do,
\v 9 but because¦141663 of love¦141666 as Paul¦141672, an older¦141673 man¦141673 and¦141676 now also a prisoner¦141678 for \nd Yeshua¦141680\nd* the \nd messiah¦141679\nd*, I'm just going to encourage you¦141668 to do it.
\v 10 \x + \xo 10: \xt Col 4:9.\x*So I'm going to encourage you¦141683 concerning Onesimus who became my \add spiritual\add* ‘son’ since I've been imprisoned.
\v 11 Before he was useless¦141699 to you, but now he's useful¦141706 to both of us.
\p
\v 12 I sent¦141708 him¦141712 to you¦141710 (even though in my heart¦141717
\v 13 I wanted to keep him \add here\add*) so that he might be serving¦141730 me \add here due to\add* the bonds¦141734 of the good¦141736 message¦141736
\v 14 but I didn't want to do anything without \add hearing\add* your¦141752 opinion¦141741, so that you're not doing good¦141751 because you have to, but rather because you want to.
\p
\v 15 It was possibly¦141757 because¦141759 of that that he¦141761 was separated¦141761 \add from you\add* for a while, so that on the eternal¦141765 \add scale\add* you could fully¦141767 accept him¦141766,
\v 16 no longer¦141768 as a slave but better than a slave—a dear brother to me most of you but preferably \add also\add* to you—a brother in the body and in the \nd master¦141787\nd*.
\p
\v 17 Therefore¦141789, if you consider me as your partner¦141793, accept him¦141795 like you'd accept me,
\v 18 but if he¦141802 did anything wrong¦141802 to you or owes you anything, charge it to me.
\v 19 \sig I, Paul¦141812, wrote¦141813 this bit in my own handwriting. I will pay back anything \+add he owes you\+add*, then I won't need to be reminding you that you \add pretty much\add* owe yourself¦141825 to me.\sig*
\v 20 \sig Yes, brother¦141831, \+add with both of us being\+add* in the \+nd master¦141836\+nd*, I might¦141834 \+add hopefully\+add* benefit¦141834 from you¦141833—refresh¦141837 my¦141838 heart¦141840 in \+add the\+add* \+nd messiah¦141842\+nd*.\sig*
\p
\v 21 \sig I wrote¦141848 to you because I was sure that you'd obey \+add my request\+add*, in fact knowing¦141850 that you'd do even more than what I ask.\sig*
\s1 Paul's final greetings
\p
\v 22 \sig \+add Go ahead and\+add* prepare¦141861 somewhere for me to stay because¦141865 I'm hoping¦141864 that I'll be able to visit \+add thanks\+add* to you all praying \+add for me\+add*.\sig*
