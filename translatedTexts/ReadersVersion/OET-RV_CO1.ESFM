\mt2 Paul's first letter to the believers in
\mt1 Corinth
\is1 Introduction
\ip This is Paul's first letter to the believers in Corinth that we have in our Bibles, but could easily have been his second letter to them. We deduce this from his reference to other letters, e.g., see https://www.GotQuestions.org/how-many-letters-Corinthians.html, but we don't have copies of them.
\ip In this letter from Paul to the believers in Corinth, he wrote about his time preaching in Ephesus. He wrote this in order to help with problems experienced by various groups of believers that he founded there in Corinth. Corinth was the mother city of province of Achaia—Achaia was a province of Rome. At that time, Corinth was a large city that Greeks, Romans, and Jews all lived in. And/Now from because ilis sika of dahat, many also the egmangendiye board of ships the egpamelegye and egpameli. Nabantug the sika city due to karatu din, and many the various religion of mahinged dutu, and many also the egmeyibhilabetey dutu and the following of tapey batasan like that. Hapit migdaruwa year(s) Paul the Lived there in order to preaching, and many the believed (Acts 18).
\ip After around three years had passed while Paul was there in Ephesus preaching, nakarawat he of letter from believers there to Corinth (1 Cor. 7:1). Nakarineg again he concerning the ehetanan of believers and of other pad problems ran there to group of believers. Te this letter, advised din them concerning due and egpepaaween din that egmeyibhilabetey sakup of group dan of believers. He answered again that questions concerning the marriage, widows, gifts of Spirit of God, and the peg-uyag of me minatey.
\ip In chapter 13, it tells how that love is an amazing gift from God to his people, in fact that's the overall theme of this document.
\ip It's helpful to understand that this letter (and most Biblical documents) were dictated to scribes (who didn't have word processors) so in terms of sentence structure, the discourses are often not edited or placed in their time sequences more correctly as we would do with modern documents, but rather we notice a lot of long, rambling, run-on sentences (like this one) which we sometimes break into shorter sentences to help our readers, but try not to do it too often as it tends to remove the connections between the thoughts and can even lead to the bad habit of people quoting verses out of the context in which they were written.

\v 4 I always¦113996 thank¦113992 my¦113995 \nd God¦113994\nd* for you because¦113999 of his grace¦114001 that he's given¦114006 you in \nd Messiah¦114009 Yeshua¦114010\nd*—
\v 5 \add thanking him\add* that through him, you've all been enriched in every¦114013 way: in all speech¦114019 and in all knowledge¦114022
\v 6 as \add our\add* testimony about the messiah\f + \fr 1:6 \ft Or alternatively: as the messiah's testimony…\f* was confirmed¦114029 in you¦114031 all
\v 7 so that you all aren't missing out on any \add spiritual\add* gift¦114038 as you eagerly¦114039 wait for our¦114044 \nd master¦114043 Yeshua¦114045 Messiah¦114046\nd* to be revealed.

\s1 Follow Yeshua, not your leaders
\rem /s1 True and false wisdom; Divisions in the Church
\p
\v 10 Now brothers¦114082 and sisters¦114082, I appeal to you in the name¦114085 of our¦114088 \nd master¦114087 Yeshua¦114089 Messiah¦114090\nd*, that you all agree together \add so\add* that there'll be no divisions¦114101 among¦114099 you, but rather that you'll be united in your thinking and in your purpose,
\v 11 because¦114116, my¦114121 brothers¦114120 and¦114120 sisters¦114120, it's been made clear to me by some from Chloe's¦114125 household, that you are quarrelling¦114127 among¦114128 yourselves.
\v 12 What I am talking¦114131 about is how many of you are claiming that you belong to Paul's group, \add for example,\add* or that you belong to Apollos' group, or that you belong to Cephas' group, or that you belong to Messiah's group.\x + \xo 1:12: \xt Acts 18:24.\x*
\v 13 Has the \nd messiah¦114154\nd* been divided¦114152? Was it Paul who was executed¦114158 for you? Or were you immersed¦114167 \add in water\add* in the Paul's name¦114165?
\p
\v 14 I thank¦114168 God that I didn't immerse¦114175 any of you¦114174 other than Crispus and¦114179 Gaius¦114180,\x + \xo 1:14: a \xt Acts 18:8; \xo b \xt Acts 19:29; Rom 16:23.\x*
\v 15 so that no one can say¦114184 that I had immersed¦114193 you¦114193 into my \add own\add* name¦114191.
\v 16 (\add Oh yes,\add* I also immersed Stephanas and his household¦114199, but I don't¦114201 think I immersed anyone else.)\x + \xo 1:16: \xt 1Cor 16:15.\x*
\v 17 Because¦114208 \nd Messiah¦114213\nd* didn't send me to immerse¦114214 people \add in water\add*, but to preach¦114216 the good message—\add but\add* not with words of wisdom¦114220 just in case the messiah's \add execution¦114226 on the\add* stake¦114226 gets deprived of importance.
\s1 The messiah is God's power and wisdom
\rem /s1 Christ the Power and Wisdom of God; The Wisdom of God
\p
\v 18 Because the account about the execution¦114234 on a stake¦114234 seems just stupid to non-believers, but on the contrary to us being¦114242 saved¦114242, it's God's power¦114244,
\v 19 because¦114248 it¦114247 was written¦114247:\x + \xo 1:19: \xt Isa 29:14 (LXX).\x*
\q1 ‘I will destroy¦114249 the wisdom¦114251 of the wise,
\q1 and¦114254 I will nullify the understanding of the intelligent¦114256.’
\m
\v 20 Where is the wise \add person\add*? Where is the scholar? Where is the debater¦114266 of this age? Hasn't \nd God¦114273\nd* turned the wisdom¦114275 of the world¦114277 into foolishness¦114271?\x + \xo 1:20: a \xt Yob 12:17; Isa 19:12; 33:18; \xo b \xt Isa 44:25.\x*
\p
\v 21 Because¦114280 since¦114279 the world¦114290, in God's wisdom, didn't know \add about\add* God through \add their\add* wisdom, God was pleased¦114296 to save¦114305 those who believe¦114307 through the ‘foolish¦114302’ message that was preached.
\v 22 Jews¦114310 ask for miraculous signs¦114311 and¦114315 Greeks¦114316 search for wisdom¦114317,
\v 23 but we¦114320 preach \add about how \add* \nd Messiah¦114323\nd* was executed¦114324—something the Jews¦114325 can't logic out, and which the Greeks see as \add total\add* foolishness¦114331.
\v 24 Yet to those who \add God\add* calls, whether Jews¦114337 or Greeks, \nd Messiah¦114341\nd* is \add both\add* God's power¦114344 and his wisdom¦114348,
\v 25 because God's foolishness¦114352 is better than mankind's wisdom, and¦114359 God's weakness is greater than mankind's strength.
\p
\v 26 So brothers¦114373 and sisters¦114373, think about how \add God\add* called you. Not many of you were wise by human standards, not many were powerful¦114382, and not many were of noble¦114385 birth,
\v 27 but¦114386 \nd God¦114393\nd* chose the foolish¦114388 things of the world to shame those \add considered to be\add* wise, and he chose the weak things of the world to shame those \add considered to be\add* strong¦114410.
\v 28 He chose¦114420 the lowly and despised things of the world¦114416, and the things that are not, to nullify¦114431 the things that are,
\v 29 so that no human can boast¦114434 to \nd God¦114440\nd*.
\v 30 But because of him, you are in \nd Messiah¦114447 Yeshua¦114448\nd*, who was made to become wisdom¦114452 from \nd God¦114456\nd* for us, and to become righteousness¦114457, and also sanctification and redemption¦114462,
\v 31 so that, as per the scriptures: ‘Let anyone who boasts, boast about the \nd master¦114469\nd*.’\x + \xo 1:31: \xt Jer 9:24.\x*

\rem /s1 Proclaiming Christ Crucified; The Message about the Crucified Christ; Paul Preaches Wisdom
\p
\v 1 Brothers¦114475 and sisters, when I visited you all, I didn't try to impress you with flowery words or great wisdom¦114483 when I taught you about God's \add incredible plan\add*,
\v 2 because¦114492 I had decided \add in advance\add* to display knowledge about nothing else other than \nd Yeshua¦114502 Messiah¦114503\nd* and¦114504 his execution¦114506.
\v 3 And so I \add came\add* to you¦114523 all in weakness¦114511 and fear¦114514 and with a lot of trembling¦114517,\x + \xo 2:3: \xt Acts 18:9.\x*
\v 4 and my message¦114526 and my preaching wasn't delivered with persuasive¦114534 words of wisdom¦114537, but \add rather\add* demonstrating¦114542 \add God's\add* \nd spirit¦114543\nd* and power¦114545,
\v 5 so that your¦114549 faith¦114548 wouldn't be based on human¦114554 wisdom¦114553, but¦114555 on God's power¦114557.
\s1 Spiritual vs human wisdom
\rem /s1 The True Wisdom of God; Wisdom From the Spirit; God's Wisdom
\p
\v 6 However, \add when we're with\add* mature¦114564 \add believers\add*, we speak¦114561 wisdom—not the wisdom of this age, and not the wisdom of the rulers¦114573 of this age who will come to nothing.
\v 7 Instead we speak¦114580 about God's mysterious¦114585 and hidden¦114587 wisdom¦114583, which he had planned before¦114592 \add creation to enable us to enter his kingdom\add*.
\v 8 None of the rulers¦114601 of this \add present\add* age understood it, because¦114608 if they had, they wouldn't¦114611 have crucified the \nd master¦114613\nd* of \add that kingdom\add*,
\v 9 but as scripture says:\x + \xo 2:9: \xt Isa 64:4.\x*
\q1 ‘No eye¦114622 has seen and no ear¦114626 has heard¦114628,
\q1 and it's never entered any person's¦114632 mind¦114631,
\q1 \add all\add* the things that \nd God¦114639\nd* has prepared¦114637 for those who love him¦114643.’
\m
\v 10 But God has revealed¦114647 it to us through¦114651 his spirit, because¦114656 \add his\add* spirit \add strives to know the meaning of everything\add*, even the deep things of God.
\v 11 \add Yes,\add* what person knows what \add other\add* people¦114668 are thinking. Only the spirit of the person themself knows that. So too, no one knows God's thoughts other than God's \add own\add* spirit.
\v 12 \add No,\add* we haven't received¦114702 the world's¦114701 spirit, but \add rather\add* God's spirit so that we can recognise everything that God has freely given to us.
\p
\v 13 We don't¦114722 speak¦114721 about these things from our human¦114725 wisdom¦114726, but rather, saying what \add God's\add* \nd spirit¦114731\nd* teaches—teaching spiritual things from spiritual \add sources\add*.
\v 14 Secular people¦114739 don't¦114740 accept things about God's \nd spirit¦114744\nd* because they seem foolish¦114747 to them, and they can't understand them because it requires spiritual awareness,
\v 15 but¦114768 spiritual¦114762 people \add can\add* discern all \add these\add* things, even though others \add can't correctly\add* discern about them.
\v 16 \add This was stated in scripture:\add*\x + \xo 2:16: \xt Isa 40:13 (LXX).\x*
\q1 ‘Who can understand the master's mind?
\q1 Who's able to instruct him¦114780?’

\p
\v 1 So brothers¦114790 and¦114790 sisters¦114790, because you were baby Christians \add when I visited\add*, I wasn't able to speak¦114794 to you all like spiritual¦114799 \add people\add*, but \add only\add* like worldly \add people\add*.
\v 2 I gave¦114810 you all milk to drink¦114810, because¦114815 you weren't ready for solid food, in fact, you still¦114821 aren't\x + \xo 3:2: \xt Heb 5:12-13.\x*
\v 3 because you're still worldly, because \add seeing\add* the jealousy¦114834 and dissension among¦114832 you \add tells us\add* that you're all still worldly and just living by human¦114845 \add values\add*.
\v 4 Yes, when one person says, ‘I follow Paul¦114854,’ and another¦114855 person says, ‘I follow Apollos¦114859’, doesn't that show that you're \add just\add* worldly?\x + \xo 3:4: \xt 1Cor 1:12.\x*
\p
\v 5 Indeed, who's Apollos¦114869? Who's Paul¦114875? We're just servants \add who brought you all the message\add* when you believed¦114882, each one as the \nd master¦114887\nd* led them.\f + \fr 3:5 \ft (NEEDS MORE RESEARCH BUT) It seems unclear here who the final part of the verse is referring to: a/ those who brought the message, or b/ those who received it. (We've chosen /b in the OET-RV rendering.)\f*
\v 6 I planted¦114890 \add the seed\add* and Apollos¦114891 watered it, but¦114893 \nd God¦114895\nd* made it grow.\x + \xo 3:6: a \xt Acts 18:4-11; \xo b \xt Acts 18:24-28.\x*
\v 7 That means the neither¦114898 the planter¦114900 or the waterer counts for anything¦114902, only the grower, \nd God¦114910\nd*.
\v 8 The planter¦114912 and the waterer do work together, and each of them will be rewarded¦114923 for their work,
\v 9 because¦114931 we¦114932 are God's co-workers.
\p You all are God's field¦114935, or \add in a different image,\add* his building¦114937.
\v 10 Using the \add gifts\add* that \nd God¦114943\nd* has given¦114945 me as a wise master-builder, I laid down a foundation¦114950 and then someone else is building on it. But they need to take care about how they build on it
\v 11 because¦114962 no one can lay a different foundation than the one already laid down, and that foundation is \nd Yeshua¦114972 Messiah¦114974\nd*.
\v 12 Now if anyone¦114977 builds¦114978 on \add top of\add* the foundation¦114981 with gold¦114984, silver¦114987, precious¦114989 stones¦114988, wood, hay, or straw¦114992,
\v 13 then their work will become¦114997 obvious because it will be revealed¦115005 on the day¦115000 \add of judgement\add* because it will be shown up by fire. The fire will expose what sort of \add building\add* their work \add created\add*:
\v 14 if anyone's¦115017 work that they built¦115022 survives the fire, \add those people\add* will be rewarded¦115024,
\v 15 \add but\add* if their work is incinerated, \add those people\add* will lose out, although they themselves will be saved¦115034 but as if they've been through¦115038 the flames.
\p
\v 16 Don't you realise that you \add yourselves\add* are God's temple¦115043, and that God's \nd spirit¦115048\nd* lives \add inside\add* you all?\x + \xo 3:16: \xt 1Cor 6:19; 2Cor 6:16.\x*
\v 17 If anyone¦115056 destroys God's temple, then God will destroy that \add person\add* because¦115068 his temple is sacred, as are all of you¦115076.
\p
\v 18 Don't let any of you fool yourselves. If anyone¦115081 of you thinks they're wise by \add worldly standards\add*, then let \add those people\add* become ‘foolish¦115091’ so that they really can become wise
\v 19 because this world's¦115100 wisdom¦115098 is foolishness¦115102 with \nd God¦115105\nd*, because as it's written¦115107: ‘He catches¦115110 out the wise in their¦115116 craftiness¦115115.’\x + \xo 3:19: \xt Yob 5:13.\x*
\v 20 And further: ‘The \nd master¦115119\nd* knows that the thoughts of wise people are useless¦115128.’\x + \xo 3:20: \xt Psa 94:11.\x*
\v 21 So the, don't let anyone¦115130 boast¦115131 about people¦115133, because¦115135 everything \add already\add* belongs to all of you¦115136.
\v 22 \add Don't boast about\add* Paul¦115139 or Apollos¦115141 or Cephas, or the world¦115145 or life¦115147 or death¦115149, or the present¦115151 or the future. All of them belong to you¦115156,
\v 23 and you¦115159 belong to Messiah, and Messiah belongs to \nd God¦115164\nd*.

\p
\v 1 So then, people should¦115167 regard us as servants of \nd Messiah¦115171\nd* and¦115172 as stewards of God's mysteries¦115174.
\v 2 What's more, stewards are expected to be trustworthy.
\v 3 But it¦115193 makes virtually no difference to me whether I'm being judged by you¦115197 all, or by a human¦115201 court, because I don't even judge myself¦115205.
\v 4 \add Yes,\add* my conscience is clear, but that won't mean that I'm declared ‘not guilty’, because¦115208 it's the \nd master¦115221\nd* who'll be examining¦115219 me.
\v 5 So don't¦115224 make judgements ahead of time, but wait until¦115229 the \nd master¦115233\nd* comes—the one who'll bring to light what's hidden¦115238 in the darkness¦115240, and who will expose people's \add true\add* motives. At that time, \nd God¦115255\nd* will praise¦115250 each person \add who's acted faithfully\add*.
\p
\v 6 Now brothers¦115258 and sisters¦115258, I applied these¦115256 things to myself¦115261 and Apollos¦115263 for your¦115265 sakes, so that through us you all might learn¦115270 this: ‘Not beyond¦115273 what is written¦115276,’ so that no one would be puffed up in favour of one against¦115285 the other¦115287,
\v 7 because¦115289 who makes you better than others? What do you have that wasn't given to you? And if it was given to you, why would you boast¦115303 as if it hadn't been given to you?
\p
\v 8 Are you all full already? Have you all already become rich? You think you're kings already, and don't need us—I wish you all were really reigning as kings, so we could reign with you,
\v 9 because it seems that God has exhibited us missionaries last \add of all\add*, as if sentenced¦115335 to death¦115335—because we¦115338 have become¦115338 a spectacle to the world¦115340—both to \add God's\add* messengers¦115342 and¦115343 to men.
\v 10 We \add appear as\add* fools for Messiah's sake, but you all are wise in Messiah. We are weak, but you all are strong¦115358. You all are honoured, but we are dishonoured¦115363.
\v 11 Right up to the present time, we're hungry and thirsty¦115371, we're poorly¦115373 clothed¦115373 and brutally beaten¦115375, and we're homeless
\v 12 and working hard—working with our own hands¦115383. When people curse us, we bless¦115385 \add them\add*, and when they persecute¦115386 us, we put up with it.\x + \xo 4:12: \xt Acts 18:3.\x*

\v 14 I'm not writing¦115403 this to shame you all, but to correct you as if you were my¦115408 \add own\add* dear children¦115407,
\v 15 because if you all would have thousands¦115415 of guardians in Messiah, yet you wouldn't have many ‘fathers¦115423’, because I fathered you in Messiah \nd Yeshua¦115427\nd* by means of the gospel.
\v 16 That's why I urge you¦115436 all to imitate¦115437 me,\x + \xo 4:16: \xt 1Cor 11:1; Php 3:17.\x*
\v 17 and that's why I sent¦115443 Timothy¦115445 to \add visit\add* you. He's like my own dear son in the \nd master¦115455\nd*, and he'll remind¦115458 you all about my ways¦115460 in \nd Messiah¦115464 Yeshua¦115465\nd*, just like I teach¦115471 everywhere in every church.
\p
\v 18 \add Now\add* some of you have become arrogant¦115479, as if I'm not able to come back to see you all,
\v 19 but if the \nd master¦115488\nd* allows it, I'll come and¦115490 visit you¦115485 all again soon. Then I won't just see what any puffed-up people are \em saying\em*, but I'll also see what \em power¦115499\em* they have,
\v 20 because¦115501 God's kingdom¦115505 isn't just mere words, but¦115508 it's \add a demonstration of\add* power¦115510.
\v 21 What would you all prefer: should I come to you all with a rod, or \add come\add* with love and a gentle¦115524 spirit¦115521?

\v 1 Actually¦115526, we've been hearing that there's sexual immorality there among you¦115530 all, and¦115532 so bad that even non-believers don't¦115536 do it: a man is sleeping with his step-mother!\x + \xo 5:1: \xt Deu 22:30.\x*
\v 2 Then instead of being upset, you all \add seem\add* proud of it. This man should have been expelled out of your¦115561 \add group\add*,

\v 4 When you assemble together¦115595 in the name of our¦115592 master Yeshua, my spirit¦115600 \add is there\add* along with the master \nd Yeshua's¦115607\nd* power¦115603,
\v 5 \add then you should\add* hand this man over to Satan¦115614 to \add punish\add* his body, so that his spirit¦115621 can be saved¦115622 for when the \nd master¦115627\nd* \add returns\add*.

\v 2 Don't you realise that \add in the future\add*, believers will judge the world, and if the world's going to be judged¦115812 by all of you, surely you're competent enough \add now\add* to judge smaller cases?
\v 3 Don't you¦115820 realise that we'll judge \add God's\add* messengers¦115822? So surely we can judge things of \add this\add* life?
\v 4 \add So then,\add* if you have legal disputes about things of this life, why do you appoint people with no standing in the assembly¦115837 as judges?
\v 5 I say \add that\add* to your shame¦115841. Don't you have anyone¦115851 among you all who can arbitrate between believers?
\v 6 But instead, one believer goes to court against another, and¦115869 it's in front of unbelievers¦115873!
\p
\v 7 Actually, you're all disgraced already for having¦115885 lawsuits¦115883 among yourselves¦115887. Why not rather be wronged¦115892? Why not rather be cheated?

\s1 Avoid sexual immorality
\rem /s1 Glorify God in Body and Spirit; Use Your Bodies for God's Glory
\p
\v 12 Some might say, ‘Everything is permissle for me,’ but not everything is beneficial¦115983. Everything might be permissible for me, but I don't¦115981 want those things to have control over me.\x + \xo 6:12: \xt 1Cor 10:23.\x*
\v 13 You might say, ‘Food is for the stomach, and the stomach for food,’ but \nd God¦116004\nd* will \add eventually\add* abolish them both. Also, the body is not \add meant to be used\add* for sexual¦116015 immorality¦116015, but rather, for the master, and the master for the body.
\v 14 \add Actually,\add* \nd God¦116026\nd* made the \nd master¦116029\nd* come alive again, and¦116031 by his¦116039 power¦116038, he'll also do that for us.
\p
\v 15 Surely you all know that your bodies¦116044 are parts of messiah's \add body\add*? Because of that, you shouldn't take your body back and then join it to a prostitute's¦116058 \add body\add*. May it never happen!
\v 16 Or don't¦116063 you¦116064 know that having sex with a prostitute¦116069 is a joining together¦116067, because¦116074 it says:\x + \xo 6:16: \xt Gen 2:24.\x* ‘The two¦116077 will become one body¦116071.’

\p
\v 18 \add Don't just walk away\add* from sexual immorality, but \em run away\em* from it, because other forms of disobeying God are outside¦116098 the body, but sexual immorality is a sin against¦116105 your own body.

\s1 Advice concerning marriage
\rem /s1 Directions concerning Marriage; Instruction on Marriage; Sex, marriage, and divorce; Questions about Marriage
\p
\v 1 Now concerning¦116156 what you all wrote¦116159 \add to me\add*: “It is good for a man not to touch¦116165 a woman¦116163.”
\v 2 However, because¦116166 there is so much sexual¦116169 immorality¦116169, each man should¦116174 have his own wife, and each woman¦116176 her own husband¦116179.
\v 3 Both husbands and wives have a marital duty to each other \add in terms of sexual needs¦116189\add*.
\v 4 Wives' bodies belong to their husbands, not to themselves, and similarly, husbands' bodies belong to their wives, not to themselves.
\v 5 Don't deprive each other, except by mutual agreement so that you may devote yourselves to prayer¦116236 for an agreed time¦116229, and then be together again¦116238, so that Satan¦116250 can't \add easily\add* tempt¦116247 you all because¦116251 of your¦116254 lack of self-control.
\p
\v 6 But that isn't a command¦116262—I'm only suggesting that it's good to do,\f + \fr 7:6 \ft It's not clear here whether Paul is referring back to marriage here (v2), or to abstaining from sex to focus on praying (v5).\f*
\v 7 and I wish everyone¦116267 could be like me. But each person has their own gift from \nd God¦116279\nd*—one has such-and-such a gift while someone else has a different one.
\p
\v 8 Now to the unmarried and¦116292 to the widows¦116294 I say that it's good¦116296 if they¦116302 remain¦116302 \add unmarried\add* like me,
\v 9 but¦116308 if they don't¦116309 have self-control, they should¦116311 marry because¦116314 it's better¦116313 to marry than to burn \add with sexual desires\add*.
\p
\v 10 Now I (\add well,\add* not I, but¦116326 the Lord) command¦116323 married¦116322 people that a wife¦116329 is not to be separated¦116333 from her husband¦116331\x + \xo 7:10-11: \xt Mat 5:32; 19:9; Mrk 10:11-12; Luk 16:18.\x*
\v 11 (but even if she might be separated¦116339, let her remain¦116340 unmarried¦116341, or let her be reconciled¦116345 to the husband), and a husband is not to divorce a wife.
\p
\v 12 But to the rest I say (I, not the Lord) that if any brother¦116362 has an unbelieving¦116365 wife¦116363 and she agrees to live with him, he shouldn't divorce her.
\v 13 Similarly, if any woman¦116377 has an unbelieving¦116383 husband and he agrees to live with her, she shouldn't divorce her husband.
\v 14 You see, the unbelieving husband¦116400 is\add exposed to faith\add* through his wife, and the unbelieving wife is \add exposed to faith\add* through the brother¦116414, otherwise¦116416 your¦116420 children¦116419 would be ‘defiled’, but now they are declared innocent.
\v 15 But if the unbeliever¦116430 departs, let \add that person\add* go. In such cases, the brother¦116436 or the sister¦116439 is not tied down \add to serving their departed spouse\add*, but¦116444 \nd God¦116450\nd* has called¦116446 us to peace¦116445.
\v 16 You see, how do you know, woman, whether you will \add cause\add* your husband to be saved? Or how do you know, man, whether you will \add cause\add* your wife to be saved?
\s1 Sticking to your social position
\rem /s1 The Life That the Lord Has Assigned; Live As God Called You
\p
\v 17 Neverthless, each person should¦116486 live according to how the \nd master¦116476\nd* has assigned them and how \nd God¦116483\nd* has called¦116481 them. That's what I teach in all the assemblies¦116492.
\v 18 Anyone who was called and who was \add previously\add* circumcised, shouldn't become uncircumcised. Anyone who was called who was uncircumcised, shouldn't get circumcised.
\v 19 Circumcision is nothing and¦116512 uncircumcision¦116514 is nothing, but¦116517 obeying God's commands¦116519 \add is what counts\add*.
\v 20 Each person should¦116531 maintain the position that they were in when they were called¦116527.
\v 21 Were you a slave when you were called¦116533? Don't be concerned about that (but indeed, if you're¦116540 able to become¦116542 free, then take the opportunity)
\v 22 because¦116546 anyone who was a slave when they were called by the master is free in the master's \add sight\add*. Conversely, anyone who was free when they were called is the master's slave.
\v 23 You all were bought¦116564 \add by God\add* for a price¦116563, \add so\add* don't¦116565 become¦116566 slaves¦116568 of people¦116569.
\v 24 \add Again\add*\x + \xo 7:24 \xt 7:20\x* brothers¦116574 and¦116574 sisters¦116574, each person should¦116577 remain¦116577 in the position they were in when they were called¦116573, \add but now serving\add* \nd God¦116580\nd*.
\s1 Suggestions about the unmarried and about widows
\rem /s1 Questions about the Unmarried and the Widows
\rem /s1 The Unmarried and the Widows
\p
\v 25 Now concerning¦116581 unmarried women, I don't¦116587 have instructions from the master but I'll give my opinions¦116589 as someone who's trustworthy¦116596 thanks to the master's mercy¦116593.
\p
\v 26 Therefore¦116599, I think¦116598 it's good because¦116603 of the distress that's about to come, that people should stay as they are \add currently\add*.
\v 27 If you're married, then don't try to get out of it. If you're not committed, don't look for a spouse.
\v 28 But if a single guy or single girl get married, that's not a sin, but¦116625 they'll \add likely\add* face difficult circumstances and I'm trying to spare you from that.
\p
\v 29 But brothers¦116653 and¦116653 sisters¦116653, I will say this: the time is short¦116656, so from now on, even those who're married should live as if they're not,
\v 30 Those who're mourning should \add act\add* as if they're not, those who're celebrating should \add act\add* as if they're not, and those who're buying¦116684 \add act\add* as if they don't¦116674 own \add anything\add*,
\v 31 and¦116688 those who're using this world, as if they're not using it¦116698, because¦116700 the present form of this world will soon pass away.
\p
\v 32 But I'd like you to be free from concern. Single men are concerned about things of the master—pleasing¦116718 the master—
\v 33 but¦116723 married¦116724 men are concerned about worldly¦116728 affairs—wanting to please¦116730 their wives—so they're divided¦116735. And unmarried¦116740 or single women
\v 34 are concerning about things of the \nd master¦116749\nd*—so that both their bodies and their spirits¦116758 can be separate \add from the world\add*— but married¦116761 women are concerned about worldly affairs—wanting to please¦116767 their husbands¦116770.
\p
\v 35 Now I said \add all\add* that for your¦116775 benefit¦116777—not to load you all with rules, but to \add act\add* in ways that are appropriate and devoted¦116790 to the \nd master¦116793\nd* without any distractions.
\p
\v 36 However, if a man thinks¦116805 he's made the wrong decisions about his unmarried woman,\f + \fr 7:36-38 \ft Yes, this sounds strange, but it's not certain here (and in the next two verses) if Paul is writing about a father and his unmarried daughter who's engaged, or about an engaged man deciding about his fiancée.\f* if she's reached the age of marriage and it should proceed, then he should do what he planned—he's not sinning¦116819—they should get married.
\v 37 But if the man has made up his mind¦116827 and isn't forced, but¦116822 makes his own decision, and he's firmly decided to keep his own woman unmarried, then that would also be a good decision.
\v 38 That way, anyone allowing his unmarried woman to marry does well, but anyone who doesn't makes a better¦116875 decision.
\p
\v 39 A wife is committed to her¦116887 husband as long as he lives, but if he passes away, she's free to marry whoever she want to, as long as he's a believer.
\v 40 However, in my opinion¦116914, she'd be happier if she didn't marry again, and I think it's God's \nd spirit¦116919\nd* \add that wants me to say that\add*.

\s1 Behaviour about food offered to idols
\rem /s1 Food Sacrificed to Idols; The Question about Food Offered to Idols
\p
\v 1 Now, concerning \add food\add* that's been sacrificed¦116926 to idols: We know¦116930 that we all have ‘knowledge’—knowledge breeds conceit but love¦116938 gives inner strength.
\v 2 Anyone who thinks they know something \add usually\add* doesn't know \add what they don't¦116947\add* know,
\v 3 but¦116956 anyone¦116957 who loves God is known¦116962 by God.
\p
\v 4 Now \add back to\add* eating \add food\add* that's been offered to idols, we¦116971 know that there's¦116968 only one \nd God¦116980\nd* and¦116977 so worldly¦116976 idols are \add really\add* nothing¦116973 \add at all\add*.
\v 5 Even though there are many so-called ‘gods’ and ‘masters¦117004’ \add said to\add* live in the heavens¦116993 or earth¦116997,
\v 6 we know there's \add only\add* one \nd God¦117009\nd*, who is the Father who created everything and we exist \add to honour him\add*. And we only have one \nd master¦117023\nd*, \nd Yeshua¦117024 Messiah¦117025\nd* who created everything and \add is also the source of our existence\add*.
\p
\v 7 But not everyone knows this. Some people have been so used to \add trusting\add* idols that \add even now as believers\add* when they eat food that's been sacrificed¦117053 to idols, \add they still think it's wrong\add* and¦117056 so their¦117059 weak consciences¦117058 become defiled¦117063.
\v 8 But food doesn't bring us closer to \nd God¦117072\nd*—what we eat makes us no better or worse off \add spiritually\add*.
\p
\v 9 However, be careful in case your¦117093 freedom becomes¦117096 a reason that weaker \add believers might get confused\add* and stumble¦117095 in their \add spiritual walk\add*.
\v 10 \add Yes,\add* if someone with a weaker conscience sees you eating¦117124 at a place with an idol, they might be encouraged to eat food that's offered to idols \add against their conscience\add*,
\v 11 thus this weaker believer who the \nd messiah¦117142\nd* also died¦117143 for, \add might end up\add* being¦117126 destroyed¦117126.
\v 12 If you end up sinning against other believers¦117149 and wounding¦117151 their¦117152 weak consciences¦117154, you sin against \nd Messiah¦117157\nd*.
\v 13 Therefore¦117159, if food might cause a fellow believer to stumble, I'll certainly never eat¦117168 meat, so that I won't cause them to stumble.
