\mt2 Paul's letter to the believers in
\mt1 Rome
\is1 Introduction
\ip \bk Paul's letter to the believers in Rome\bk* was sent to both Jews and non-Jews who believe in, and trust Yeshua the messiah. He wrote to them so that they could be prepared for when he could visit them there. Paul planned to work there with other Christians for a while, then, with their help, he would travel to Spain. He wrote in order to explain his understanding of Christian faith and of day-to-day living as Christians.
\ip Paul greets the believers there in Rome and he tells them about his prayers for them. Then he tells them the theme of his letter, “how \nd God\nd* makes us guiltless—by faith.” (1:17a). All people, Jewish or not, need to become guiltless in God's sight by means of faith in Yeshua Messiah.
\ip Next Paul tells them about new life by means of unity with the messiah there egpangkus of new rilasyun there to God. Duen e keupianan of believers other of God and inluwas sikandan by means of power of Spirit of God puun of power of sale and of death. In chapters 5-8, Paul explains about the purpose of Law of God and about the power of God's spirit working through believers.

\v 8 I'll start by thanking¦106146 my¦106149 \nd God¦106148\nd* through¦106150 \nd Yeshua¦106151 Messiah¦106152\nd* for all of you, because¦106157 the \add story about\add* your¦106156 faith¦106159 has been told in many countries.
\v 9 Yes, the \nd God¦106171\nd* that I serve in my spirit¦106176 in the good¦106180 message¦106180 about his¦106183 son, is my witness¦106166 about how I never stop mentioning¦106186 all of you¦106187
\v 10 in my¦106193 prayers¦106192—asking that somehow¦106196 \nd God¦106204\nd* will favour me by allowing me to come¦106205 to visit you¦106207
\v 11 because I'm longing¦106208 to see¦106210 you all so that I can share¦106214 a particular spiritual¦106217 gift¦106215 with you so that you'll all be strengthened¦106220.
\v 12 I want us to \add all\add* be encouraged¦106225 together¦106225 by each other's faith¦106233—both me and all of you.

\p
\v 16 \x + \xo 1:16: \xt Mrk 8:38.\x*I'm not ashamed¦106293 to preach the good¦106295 message¦106295 because¦106299 it \add conveys\add* God's power¦106298 to save everyone¦106304 who believes¦106306 it—to Jews first¦106309 and then non-Jews.

\s1 God's anger towards those who deny his existence
\rem /s1 The Guilt of Humankind; Human Guilt; God's judgement on sin; God's Wrath Against Mankind; God's Anger at Sin
\p
\v 18 God's severe¦106334 anger¦106334 is being¦106332 revealed¦106332 from heaven¦106337 on the ungodliness¦106340 and¦106341 disobedience of people¦106343 who limit the truh by \add their\add* disobedience
\v 19 because the fact that there is a God has been shown to them because God \add himself\add* has revealed¦106364 it¦106364.
\v 20 Ever since the creation¦106370 of the world¦106371, the invisible¦106367 attributes of God have been clearly¦106375 seen¦106375 through his workmanship¦106373—both his eternal¦106378 power¦106380 and¦106381 his divinity¦106382—so \add people\add* have no excuse.
\v 21 \x + \xo 1:21: \xt Eph 4:17-18.\x*Even though they know \add about\add* \nd God¦106391\nd*, they didn't honour or thank¦106397 him, but their theories made them incompetent and their minds turned from perception towards darkness.
\v 22 They claimed to be scientific but instead they¦106414 believed foolishness¦106414
\v 23 \x + \xo 1:23: \xt Deu 4:16-18.\x*and \add so\add* they¦106416 changed¦106416 the greatness of the eternal \nd God¦106421\nd* into the likeness¦106423 of an image¦106424 of a mortal¦106425 human¦106426, or birds¦106428 or animals or reptiles¦106432.
\p
\v 24 Therefore¦106433 \nd God¦106438\nd* reluctantly let their lusts lead to impurity¦106446 and the dishonouring¦106448 of their bodies¦106450 among themselves¦106453
\v 25 as they exchanged¦106456 God's truth¦106458 for a lie and now worshipped¦106465 and served the creation, instead of the creator who \add should be\add* praised throughout the ages. May¦106479 it¦106472 be so¦106479.
\p
\v 26 Because¦106480 of that, \nd God¦106485\nd* reluctantly let them exercise their dishonourable¦106488 passions¦106487 and their women exchanged¦106494 natural acts for those against nature,
\v 27 and similarly their men deserted the natural¦106511 acts towards women and stoked their lusts towards each other—man with man and the shame¦106528 that it¦106534 produces¦106529, and then received back in themselves¦106540 the payment which¦106533 is appropriate¦106534 for such deception¦106536.
\p
\v 28 They didn't want to know¦106550 about \nd God¦106547\nd* and so he reluctantly let their depraved minds be filled with unhelpful thoughts
\v 29 and so they were filled¦106562 with disobedience, wickedness¦106567, greediness¦106569, and malice, and full of envy, murder¦106573, strife¦106574, and deceit¦106576, \add becoming\add* malicious, gossips¦106578,
\v 30 slanderers¦106579, god-haters¦106580, abusers¦106581, proud¦106582, braggers¦106583, inventors¦106584 of evil¦106585, unable to be persuaded by \add their\add* parents¦106586,
\v 31 unintelligent¦106588, untrustworthy¦106589, unloving¦106590, \add and\add* unmerciful¦106592.
\v 32 They know that \nd God¦106597\nd* must exercise justice towards those doing¦106604 such things, yet they not only practice those things which will lead to a death¦106606 sentence, but they also approve when others do them.

\s1 Judgement even for those without the written law
\rem /s1 The Righteous Judgment of God; God's Righteous Judgment; God's Judgment of Sin
\p
\v 1 \x + \xo 2:1: \xt Mat 7:1; Luk 6:37.\x*So there's no excuse for anyone who judges others because¦106638 you're condemning¦106636 yourselves¦106635 if you're doing¦106640 those same things¦106639 that you're judging other for
\v 2 because we¦106643 know that God's judgement is based on the factual accounts of what \add each person\add* is doing.
\v 3 But maybe you're¦106660 thinking that you can judge others doing¦106672 these things¦106669 and yet \add somehow\add* escape¦106676 God's judgement when you do them yourself¦106673?
\v 4 Or maybe you're¦106693 \add taking advantage\add* of God's kindness and patience¦106692 without realising that his¦106686 kindness was \add meant\add* to lead you towards repentance¦106701?
\v 5 But it's your¦106708 hardness¦106707 and failure to repent that \add causing\add* severe anger to be stored up for the day of God's judgement when \add all\add* will be revealed \add including\add* his severe anger
\v 6 \x + \xo 2:6: \xt Psa 62:12; Prv 24:12.\x*as each person will be \add judged\add* by their actions.
\v 7 Those who've endured¦106736 to do good¦106738 expecting praise and honour¦106741 and to escape destruction, \add will be given\add* eternal¦106746 life¦106745,
\v 8 but those who've \add lived out\add* their selfish¦106750 ambition¦106750 and refused to believe the truth¦106755 but \add let themselves get\add* persuaded¦106756 by disobedience, \add will meet with\add* severe¦106761 anger¦106761 and rage¦106763.
\v 9 For every¦106769 person doing evil¦106775, there will be tribulation and distress¦106767—to Jews first¦106778 and then to non-Jews,
\v 10 but to those who do good¦106791, there'll be praise and honour¦106784 and peace¦106786—to Jews first¦106794 and then to non-Jews
\v 11 \x + \xo 2:11: \xt Deu 10:17.\x*because \nd God¦106803\nd* doesn't \add indulge in\add* favouritism¦106800.
\p
\v 12 Those not under the \add Jewish\add* laws and yet sinned, they'll be judged without the law, and those who knew the laws and sinned, will be judged by the law,
\v 13 because listening¦106822 to the law doesn't make \add people\add* right¦106825 with \nd God¦106828\nd*, but¦106829 rather it's those who obey the law who will be declared guiltless.
\v 14 Whenever other nations don't have \add Jewish\add* law but naturally¦106842 obey what's in the laws, then even those that don't have \add our\add* laws have their own law.
\v 15 They demonstrate that they effectively have \add God's\add* law written¦106861 in their minds and which matches their consciences¦106869, and between¦106871 the two they'll be either accused¦106875 or defended¦106878
\v 16 on the day¦106881 when \nd God¦106887\nd* through \nd Messiah¦106897 Yeshua¦106898\nd*, judges people's¦106891 private \add lives\add* as I've shared \add as part of\add* the good¦106894 message¦106894.
\s1 Jews who disobey their laws
\rem /s1 The Jews and their law
\p
\v 17 But if you're a Jew¦106904 and trusting in the law and boasting¦106911 about \add being¦106905 chosen by\add* \nd God¦106913\nd*
\v 18 and knowing his will and knowing what's important because of familiarity with the law,
\v 19 and if you've persuaded¦106926 yourself¦106928 that you're a guide¦106929 for the blind¦106931 and a light¦106932 to those who're in darkness¦106935,
\v 20 and that you're an instructor¦106936 to foolish¦106937 people and a teacher¦106938 of children, and that you appear¦106942 to be knowledgable¦106944 about the truth¦106947 of the law,
\v 21 then why do you teach others when you haven't \add even\add* taught¦106953 yourself¦106955? You announce that stealing is wrong, but you're¦106962 a thief.
\v 22 You teach about not messing with other people's spouses, yet you do it yourself. You detest¦106969 idols¦106971, but you sneak money out of the temple¦106972.
\v 23 You boast¦106976 about \add being a student \add* of the law, but you¦106984 dishonour¦106984 \nd God¦106983\nd* by breaking the laws.
\v 24 \x + \xo 2:24: \xt Isa 52:5 (LXX).\x*\add Yes,\add* it's been written¦106997: ‘God's name¦106987 is slandered¦106992 among¦106993 the nations because¦106990 of you¦106991 all.’
\p
\v 25 Circumcision¦106998 is of value if you're keeping the law, but if you're breaking the laws, then your¦107012 circumcision¦107011 is just the same as if you're uncircumcised¦107013,
\v 26 so if uncircumcised \add peoples\add* act justly according to the law, even though they're not physically circumcised¦107030, \add God\add* will consider them as his¦107028 people.
\v 27 \add Yes, those peoples\add* who're not circumcised but keep the law, will be judging¦107033 you¦107041 who were given the law in writing and¦107045 are circumcised, yet break those laws.
\v 28 A \add true\add* Jew is not just a Jew on the outside, and circumcision¦107064 isn't just on the outside of the body,
\v 29 \x + \xo 2:29: \xt Deu 30:6.\x*but is a Jew¦107070 even in their private life and through circumcision¦107072 of their heart¦107073—by the \nd spirit¦107075\nd* and not by the letter¦107077 of the law—earning praise¦107080 not from people, but from \nd God¦107087\nd*.
\c 3
\rem /s1 God's Faithfulness; God Remains Faithful
\p
\v 1 So what advantage is it in being a Jew¦107093 and what's the benefit¦107097 of circumcision¦107099?
\v 2 A lot in every¦107102 way. Firstly¦107104, Jews were entrusted¦107108 with \add the writing down\add* of God's messages.
\v 3 But what if some didn't believe? Wouldn't the unbelief¦107121 of Jews make faith¦107124 \add that comes from\add* \nd God¦107126\nd* worthless?
\v 4 \x + \xo 3:4: \xt Psa 51:4 (LXX).\x*Absolutely not. Even if every¦107135 person¦107137 was a liar, \nd God¦107133\nd* is true just like it's been written¦107141 \add about him\add*:
\q1 ‘You will be proved right about what you say,
\q2 and XXX.’
\p
\v 5 But if our¦107160 sinfulness highlights God's sinlessness, what can we¦107165 say about that? \add So\add* isn't God, the one inflicting¦107171 the severe¦107173 anger¦107173, wrong \add to punish us\add*. (Of course this is reasoning from a human¦107176 perspective.)
\v 6 Of course not, otherwise how could \nd God¦107185\nd* be able to judge the world¦107187?
\p
\v 7 But if my lie \add exposes\add* God's truth¦107192 and so brings him honour, why would he still¦107205 judge¦107209 me as a sinner¦107208?
\v 8 Some people falsely accuse us of saying, ‘Let's do evil things so that good might follow.’ Those who say that deserve their¦107231 punishment.
\s1 No person is guiltless
\rem /s1 No One is Righteous; All People Are Sinners
\p
\v 9 What then? Do \add Jews\add* have any advantage¦107237? Definitely not, because¦107242 we¦107241 showed earlier that both Jews and¦107246 other nationalities are all under¦107249 sin's \add shadow\add*
\v 10 \x + \xo 3:10-12: \xt Psa 14:1-3 (LXX); Psa 53:1-3 (LXX).\x*just like it¦107253 was written¦107253 long ago:
\q1 ‘No one is guiltless,
\q2 not even one person.
\q1
\v 11 No one understands¦107263,
\q2 there's not even one person trying to find \nd God¦107270\nd*.
\q1
\v 12 Everyone has turned¦107272 away,
\q2 it was a waste of time.
\q1 No one is being¦107274 kind,
\q2 Not even one person.’
\q1
\v 13 \x + \xo 3:13: a \xt Psa 5:9 (LXX); \xo b \xt Psa 140:3.\x*‘Their words lead to death,
\q2 their¦107290 tongues¦107292 are deceptive.’
\q1 ‘Their lips¦107299 spray out poison.’
\q1
\v 14 \x + \xo 3:14: \xt Psa 10:7 (LXX).\x*‘Their mouths¦107303 are full of cursing¦107305 and¦107306 bitterness¦107307.’
\q1
\v 15 \x + \xo 3:15-17: \xt Isa 59:7-8.\x*‘They rush off to go and shed blood¦107314.
\q2
\v 16 They leave trails of destruction¦107315 and¦107316 misery¦107317—
\q2
\v 17 they¦107326 don't¦107325 know the path¦107323 \add that leads to\add* peace¦107324.’
\q2
\v 18 \x + \xo 3:18: \xt Psa 36:1.\x*Revering \nd God¦107330\nd* isn't at the front¦107331 of their¦107334 \add minds\add*.
\p
\v 19 We know that whatever the law says, it's for \add everyone¦107349\add* that the law applies to, so that no one can speak¦107347 against it, and¦107352 the whole world¦107357 will be bound by God's judgement.
\v 20 \x + \xo 3:20: \xt Psa 143:2; Gal 2:16.\x*No human will be declared guiltless in front of God by their keeping the law, because¦107371 it's the law that teaches what sin¦107374 is.
\s1 Removing the guilt from sin
\rem /s1 Righteousness through Faith; How We Are Put Right with God; Christ Took Our Punishment
\p
\v 21 But now \nd God¦107380\nd* has revealed¦107381 a way to remove guilt that's not by rules—a way that Moses and¦107386 the prophets¦107388 wrote about.
\v 22 \x + \xo 3:22: \xt Gal 2:16.\x*We can be made right¦107389 with \nd God¦107391\nd* through¦107392 faith¦107393 in \nd Yeshua¦107395 Messiah¦107396\nd*. This is for \em everyone\em* who believes¦107405 because¦107407 there's¦107408 no distinction¦107409 \add between Jews and¦107390 others\add*
\v 23 because everyone has sinned¦107412 and¦107413 is unable to be honoured by \nd God¦107419\nd*.
\v 24 \add But\add* even without deserving it, we can be declared guiltless by God's grace¦107424 by being¦107420 bought out of slavery \add to sin\add* by \nd Messiah¦107430 Yeshua¦107431\nd*
\v 25 who God placed \add on the altar\add* as a sacrifice for sin. \add This happens¦107454\add* through¦107437 faith¦107439 in his blood¦107444 which was a sign¦107446 of his sinlessness.
\p (God hasn't yet judged those who sinned in the past
\v 26 because¦107461 of his patience, waiting for the present¦107469 time¦107470 to show his righteousness¦107465 and to be fair, and to remove the guilt of those with faith¦107480 in \nd Yeshua¦107481\nd*.)
\p
\v 27 So where¦107482 does that leave boasting¦107485? It's not in the picture. How come? Through¦107487 obeying the \add Moses'\add* laws? No, through¦107494 a law about faith¦107496.
\v 28 So now we¦107497 should expect that a person¦107503 will be made guiltless by faith¦107502—not by obeying \add Moses'\add* laws.

\v 1 So what did our¦107557 human ancestor, Abraham¦107553 discover about all this?
\v 2 Because if Abraham¦107563 was declared guiltless because of his actions, maybe he¦107567 could boast¦107568? But not towards¦107571 \nd God¦107573\nd*
\v 3 \x + \xo 4:3: \xt Gen 15:6; Gal 3:6.\x*because¦107587 the scriptures¦107577 say: ‘Abraham¦107581 believed¦107579 in \nd God¦107583\nd* so he was considered guiltless.’
\v 4 Now for someone who's working¦107591, their wages are considered ‘owed’, not a gift.
\v 5 However someone who's not working¦107605 but having faith that \add God\add* will declare disobedient people as guiltless, then that person's faith is considered to make them guiltless.
\v 6 It's just like what David¦107629 said about blessing¦107632 a person¦107634 who \nd God¦107637\nd* declares as guiltless despite their actions:
\q1
\v 7 \x + \xo 4:7-8: \xt Psa 32:1-2.\x*‘Those who've been forgiven¦107644 for their lawlessness¦107646 will be happy,
\q2 and whose sins¦107651 have been covered¦107649 over.
\q1
\v 8 The person who the \nd master¦107659\nd* declares to have no sin¦107660 will be happy.’
\p
\v 9 Is this favour shown to circumcised¦107667 Jews or is it also for non-Jews? Because we¦107674 were saying¦107674 that Abraham¦107679 was considered guiltless because¦107682 of his faith¦107681.
\v 10 So how did that happen? Because he was circumcised or when he was \add still\add* uncircumcised? No, it¦107686 was before he was circumcised.
\v 11 \x + \xo 4:11: \xt Gen 17:10.\x*He received¦107701 circumcision¦107702 as a sign¦107700—proof of the righteousness that he gained from his faith¦107708 while he was still uncircumcised—becoming the father¦107717 of everyone who's uncircumcised but believes¦107720 so that they'll be declared guiltless.
\v 12 So our¦107755 ancestor Abraham¦107756 is the ancestor of us as a circumcised people, not just because we're circumcised, but¦107739 also as we follow his steps¦107744 of faith¦107752 while uncircumcised¦107750.

\v 18 \x + \xo 4:18: \xt Gen 15:5.\x*\add Without any other evidence\add*, he believed¦107867 in hope itself and thus he became the father¦107872 of many nations¦107874 according¦107875 to what he had be told: ‘Your¦107882 descendants¦107881 will be like \add the sand and the stars\add*.’
\v 19 \x + \xo 4:19: \xt Gen 17:17.\x*He didn't falter¦107885 in his faith¦107887, seeing that his body¦107892 was already¦107893 infertile being about¦107896 a hundred¦107895 years old and¦107898 with Sarah being past menopause,
\v 20 but he didn't show unbelief¦107913 and doubt¦107911 God's promise¦107907 when it was given¦107918, but rather he was strengthened¦107915 in his faith¦107917 and praised God,

\v 22 Therefore¦107931 \add his faith\add* was credited to him¦107934 and he was declared guiltless.

\v 3 Not only that, but we are also boasting¦108024 even though we're still being persecuted, because we know that difficulties produce¦108034 endurance¦108033
\v 4 and endurance¦108037 shows who we really are, and knowing that produces hope,
\v 5 and we're not disgraced¦108048 by that hope because¦108049 God's love¦108051 has been poured¦108054 out into our¦108059 hearts¦108057 through¦108060 the holy \nd spirit¦108061\nd* who has been given¦108064 to us.

\s1 Death through Adam but life through Yeshua
\rem /s1 Adam and Christ Contrasted; Death Through Adam, Life Through Christ
\p
\v 12 \x + \xo 5:12: \xt Gen 3:6.\x*Sin came into the world¦108182 through¦108197 one man, and death came as a result of sin, so death spread to everyone because¦108198 everyone has disobeyed God.
\v 13 Sin was in the world¦108209 before \add Moses'\add* law, but¦108211 it wasn't being charged against them, because the law had not yet \add been given\add*.
\v 14 But death¦108223 reigned¦108221 from \add the time of\add* Adam until¦108226 \add the time of\add* Moses, even over those who didn't sinned¦108232 in the way that Adam did—Adam\f + \fr 5:14 \ft Adam is called ‘the son of God’ in Luke 3:38.\f* who was a pattern¦108242 of the \add messiah\add* who would \add eventually\add* come.
\p
\v 15 But the gift is not like the disobedience, because if the disobedience of one man introduced death for many, God's grace and the gift that comes from that grace is much more. That gift is the one man \nd Yeshua¦108279 Messiah¦108280\nd* who has been given to very many \add people\add*.
\v 16 It only took one man who disobeyed \add to lead to\add* condemnation¦108301, and one act of disobedience \add to lead to\add* judgement, but the gift is to bring guiltlessness despite \em many\em* acts of disobedience.
\v 17 Because if the disobedience of one man led to death¦108319 reigning \add over us\add* through that one man, how much more will the ones receiving¦108339 an abundance¦108328 of grace¦108331 and the gift¦108334 of righteousness¦108338 be reigning in life¦108341 through the one man \nd Yeshua¦108347 Messiah¦108348\nd*. 
\p
\v 18 So just as one act of disobedience \add led\add* all people to condemnation¦108360, so also one action \add brought\add* all people to guiltlessness \add and hence to\add* life¦108371.
\v 19 The disobedience¦108376 of one man brought caused many people to be made sinners¦108380, so also the obedience¦108390 of one man caused many people to be made guiltless.
\p
\v 20 The law was inserted so that acts of disobedience would be plentiful, but¦108406 where¦108405 sin¦108409 has been plentiful, grace¦108412 has overflowed¦108410
\v 21 so that just as sin¦108417 reigned in death¦108420, so also grace¦108424 now reigns through righteousness¦108428, \add leading to\add* eternal¦108431 life¦108430 through our¦108438 \nd master¦108437 Yeshua¦108434 Messiah¦108435\nd*.

\v 5 If we have joined together¦108507 in the likeness¦108510 of his¦108513 death¦108512, then we will also be \add joined\add* in the resurrection¦108517,

\v 7 because the personality that's died¦108543 has been declared free from sin¦108547.
\v 8 So if we died¦108551 with \nd Messiah¦108553\nd*, we also believe¦108554 that we will live with him¦108558,
\v 9 knowing¦108559 that now that \nd Messiah¦108561\nd* has come back to life from the dead¦108564, he won't die again—death¦108567 has no more power over him¦108568.
\v 10 When he died, he died to sin¦108575 once and for all, but now that he lives, he lives to \add please\add* \nd God¦108583\nd*.
\v 11 So to you¦108586 should be considering yourselves¦108588 dead¦108590 to sin¦108594, and at the same time, alive to \nd God¦108598\nd* in \nd Messiah¦108600 Yeshua¦108601\nd*.
\p
\v 12 So therefore don't¦108605 let sin¦108609 be reigning¦108607 in your¦108613 mortal¦108612 bodies in such a way that you're submitting¦108617 to its lusts¦108621.
\v 13 Don't be using any parts of your bodies to sin¦108632 as if they're weapons of disobedience, but instead present¦108625 yourselves¦108635 to God as if you came back to life from the dead¦108641, and use all your body parts for God as if they're weapons of righteousness¦108649

\v 5 People who live according to their physical desires, think about physical things, but those who live according to the spirit, think about spiritual things.
\v 6 The worldly mindset \add leads to\add* death¦109420, but¦109422 the \nd spiritual¦109425\nd* mindset \add leads to\add* life¦109426 and¦109427 peace¦109428.
\v 7 The worldly mindset¦109431 is making God your enemy because it's not being¦109443 subjected¦109443 to God's law, in fact it's not even able to,
\v 8 and those who are worldly aren't able to bring¦109453 pleasure¦109453 to \nd God¦109452\nd*.
\p
\v 9 And all of you aren't worldly, but in the spirit, if indeed¦109465 God's spirit is living¦109468 in you, but anyone¦109473 who doesn't have the spirit of \nd Messiah¦109475\nd*, doesn't belong to him.
\v 10 But if \nd Messiah¦109484\nd* is in you¦109486, while your body¦109489 is dead¦109490 because of sin¦109492, your \nd spirit¦109495\nd* has life¦109496 because it's \add been declared\add* guiltless.
\v 11 \x + \xo 8:11: \xt 1Cor 3:16.\x*\add Yes,\add* if the spirit of the one who brought Yeshua back to life is living in you, then the one who brought \nd Messiah¦109518\nd* Yeshua back to life will also give life to your¦109526 mortal¦109524 bodies¦109525 by means of his¦109532 spirit living inside you all.
\p
\v 12 So then brothers¦109540 and¦109540 sisters¦109540, we don't¦109543 owe anything to our sinful natures, nor do we need worldly living¦109549.
\v 13 If you all live according¦109552 to the sinful nature, you'll die, but if you put bodily practices¦109561 to death¦109564 with \add the help of the\add* \nd spirit¦109559\nd*, you'll live,
\v 14 because all those who're led by God's \nd spirit¦109568\nd* \add become\add* God's children.
\v 15 \x + \xo 8:15-17: \xt Gal 4:5-7.\x*You didn't receive a spirit of slavery¦109581 to fear again¦109582, but \add rather\add* it was the spirit of adoption¦109588 as children that you all received, and \add with his help\add* we call out, ‘Father, father.’
\v 16 \add God's\add* spirit himself agrees together with our¦109601 spirit that we are God's children¦109604,
\v 17 and if we're \add his\add* children¦109608, then we're also heirs so we'll receive an inheritance from \nd God¦109613\nd*. That makes us fellow-heirs¦109614 along with \nd Messiah¦109616\nd*—if we're suffering¦109619 with him then we'll also be honoured along with him.
\s1 Even creation itself is waiting
\rem /s1 The Future Glory
\p
\v 18 I'm sure that any sufferings¦109631 \add we experience\add* in the present¦109633 \add age\add* are nothing in comparison with the coming splendour that's going¦109637 to be revealed¦109639 to us
\v 19 because \add all of\add* creation¦109646 is eagerly¦109644 expecting¦109644 and waiting¦109653 for God's children to be revealed.
\v 20 \x + \xo 8:20: \xt Gen 3:17-19.\x*\add Yes,\add* all of creation¦109658 has been subjected to lack of purpose, not willingly¦109661 but because¦109663 it was decided by the one who subjected it, but \add it remains with\add* the hope
\v 21 that it too will be freed from the slavery¦109679 of corruption¦109681 and then \add released\add* into the freedom of the splendour of God's children¦109688,
\v 22 because we're aware that all of creation¦109697 is groaning¦109698 and¦109699 suffering\f + \fr 8:22 \ft The word picture here is one of childbirth.\f* along with us right through to the present time¦109702.
\v 23 \x + \xo 8:23: \xt 2Cor 5:2-4.\x*And not only that, but we¦109716 ourselves who have the initial tastes of the \nd spirit¦109713\nd* \add life\add*, we also are groaning¦109721 and like children waiting¦109723 for our¦109728 bodies to be set free from slavery
\v 24 because we¦109732 were saved¦109732 having hope, but¦109734 if you can see it then it's not hope, because you don't¦109736 need to hope for something that you can \add already\add* see.
\v 25 So we hope for what we can't \add yet\add* see and \add so\add* we have to patiently keep waiting¦109755.
\p
\v 26 Similarly the spirit also helps \add us\add* with our¦109766 weaknesses¦109765, because¦109768 we don't¦109774 \add even\add* know what to pray for, but the spirit intercedes¦109780 with groanings¦109783 that we can't put into words.
\v 27 The one who searches¦109787 our hearts¦109789 knows the mindset¦109793 of the spirit because¦109796 the spirit intercedes for the believers as \nd God¦109798\nd* desires.

\v 28 We know that \nd God¦109808\nd* makes all things¦109809 work together¦109811 for good¦109815 for those who love him—those who are being¦109820 called¦109819 according¦109817 to \add his\add* purpose¦109818.
\v 29 Because¦109821 those he foreknew¦109823, he also predetermined¦109825 \add to be\add* similar¦109826 to his son's image¦109828, so that \add his son\add* would become the eldest of many siblings.
\v 30 The ones he'd predetermined¦109844 he also called, and the ones he'd called, he also declared guiltless, and the ones declared guiltless, he also honoured \add in heaven\add*.
\s1 Nothing can separate us from God's love

\v 31 So then, what can we¦109864 say about all this? If \nd God¦109869\nd* is for us, who is against¦109873 us?
\v 32 If he didn't spare¦109881 his own son but gave¦109886 him \add to be executed\add* for us, won't the two of them also give us everything else?
\v 33 Who will bring charges against¦109901 those chosen¦109902 by God? God is the one declaring \add us\add* guiltless.
\v 34 So who's the one condemning¦109909 \add us\add*? \nd Messiah¦109913 Yeshua¦109914\nd* (the one who died¦109916 but¦109918 came back to life and who's now \add sitting\add* beside \nd God¦109929\nd*) is also pleading¦109932 \em for\em* us.
\v 35 Who will separate¦109938 us from Messiah's love¦109942? Tribulation¦109950 or distress¦109952 or persecution¦109954 or famine¦109956 or poverty or danger¦109960 or execution?
\v 36 \x + \xo 8:36: \xt Psa 44:22.\x*As it's been written¦109964:

\v 37 But in all that, we¦109981 are more than conquerors¦109981 through¦109982 the one who loved¦109984 us.
\v 38 \add Yes,\add* I've been persuaded¦109986 that neither¦109989 death¦109990 or life¦109992, angels or rulers¦109996, present¦110003 or future events, powers¦110007,

\v 8 That isn't \add talking about\add* worldly children—these¦110167 are God's children, but the children of the promise¦110175 are being¦110176 counted¦110176 as descendants¦110178.

\v 1 We who are powerful should be bearing¦112762 the weaknesses¦112759 of the powerless rather than \add just\add* seeking to bring¦112766 pleasure¦112766 to ourselves¦112765.

\v 4 Because everything that was written in the past, was written for teaching¦112805 us so that through endurance¦112811 and through the encouragement from the scriptures¦112817, we would have hope.
\v 5 May the \nd God¦112825\nd* of endurance¦112827 and¦112828 encouragement help you¦112833 all to think¦112836 likewise, just like \nd Yeshua¦112841 Messiah¦112840\nd* did,

\v 13 May the \nd God¦112967\nd* of hope that you believe¦112985 in fill¦112971 you all with happiness and peace¦112981 so that your hope in the power¦112994 of the holy \nd spirit¦112995\nd* will be \add grow to be\add* plentiful¦112988.
\s1 Paul as missionary to non-Jews
\rem /s1 Paul the Minister to the Gentiles; Paul's Reason for Writing So Boldly
\p
\v 14 My¦113000 brothers¦112999 and sisters¦112999, I've also been persuaded¦112997 about you myself¦113002, that having¦113013 been filled¦113013 with knowledge¦113016, you're also full of goodness¦113012 and able to rebuke each other.
\v 15 But I wrote¦113025 to you more boldly¦113022, partly to remind¦113034 you all because¦113036 of the grace¦113038 given¦113040 to me by \nd God¦113045\nd*
\v 16 so that I'd be a minister¦113051 to the non-Jews for \nd Messiah¦113052 Yeshua¦113053\nd*, sharing God's good¦113060 message¦113060 so that the offering¦113068 of the non-Jews would be acceptable¦113071 \add to him\add*, having¦113072 been purified by the holy \nd spirit¦113074\nd*. WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?
\v 17 Therefore¦113078 I'm boasting¦113080 in \nd Messiah¦113082 Yeshua¦113083\nd* about things¦113084 \add to do with\add* \nd God¦113087\nd*.
\v 18 I wouldn't dare to speak¦113095 about anything¦113093 that wasn't done through¦113100 me by \nd Messiah¦113099\nd*, that led to the obedience¦113105 of non-Jews¦113106 by \add my\add* message¦113107 and¦113108 \add by my\add* working
\v 19 powerful miracles and amazing things in the power of God's \nd spirit¦113119\nd*, so that from Yerusalem¦113125 all the way around¦113127 to Illyricum, I've obeyed the Messiah's good message¦113133.
\v 20 I was enthusiastic to to be preaching¦113140 the good¦113140 message¦113140 wherever¦113142 \nd Messiah¦113145\nd* wasn't known about so that I wouldn't be building¦113151 on other's foundations¦113150,
\v 21 \x + \xo 15:21: \xt Isa 52:15 (LXX).\x*but as it has been written¦113154:
\q1 ‘Anyone who hasn't been told about him,
\q2 they will be seeing¦113161,

\rem /s1 Paul's Travel Plans; Paul's Plan to Visit Rome
\v 23 but now I no longer¦113179 have a role in those regions¦113186. I've been wanting to come¦113192 there for many years¦113198 now—
\v 24 whenever I'm able to go to Spain next I'm hoping¦113210 to see¦113214 you on my way, and then after \add spending time\add* with you all, you'll be able to send me on to my destination.
\v 25 \x + \xo 15:25-26: \xt 1Cor 16:1-4.\x*But for now, I'm going¦113230 to Yerusalem¦113232 to serve the believers there.
\v 26 \add The believers in\add* Macedonia¦113243 and¦113244 Achaia took¦113238 pleasure¦113238 in making a contribution for the poor \add people\add* among the believers \add there\add* in Yerusalem¦113257.
\v 27 \x + \xo 15:27: \xt 1Cor 9:11.\x*They took pleasure¦113258 \add but\add* they're also in debt to them, because¦113268 if the non-Jews¦113274 have shared¦113272 in \add Jewish\add* spiritual¦113270 things, then they should also minister¦113280 to them with material¦113279 things.
\v 28 So then, having done that and¦113285 having guaranteed \add heavenly rewards\add* for them, I will go to Spain by way of your \add place\add*,
\v 29 and I know that when I come, I'll come \add bearing\add* Messiah's full blessing¦113307.
\p
\v 30 So brothers¦113316 and sisters¦113316, I'm urging you¦113315 by our¦113320 \nd master¦113319 Yeshua¦113321 Messiah¦113322\nd* and by the love¦113326 of the \nd spirit¦113328\nd*, to contend¦113329 along with me in praying to \nd God¦113338\nd* for me
\v 31 that I will escape from \add the schemes of\add* those in Yudea who refuse to believe. Also pray that my¦113352 ministry in Yerusalem¦113356 would be acceptable¦113358 to the believers there
\v 32 so that by God's will, I can happily come¦113371 to your place and be refreshed \add there\add* with you all.
\v 33 \add May\add* the \nd God¦113385\nd* of peace¦113387 be with all of you¦113390. May it¦113443 be so¦113443.
