\is1 Introduction
\ip This is \bk the second letter of Paul that we have that's written to Timothy\bk*. He wrote it from Rome when he was imprisoned there as a result of his preaching about Yeshua the messiah. Timothy was still teaching the believers in Ephesus, so here Paul requests him to come to see him before he gets sentenced to death.
\ip In this letter, Paul advised Timothy to be strong so that he can persevere in his preaching and doing God's work even in the middle of suffering and when others oppose him. He also warns Timothy about the coming evil of teachers of false doctrines because these can destroy the faith of the listeners.
\ip Most of all, Paul reminds Timothy about his life so that Paul's faith and endurance would be an example for Timothy to follow: his humility, his love, and his enduring suffering from those who persecuted him.

\v 1 \add This letter is from\add* Paul¦139498, an ambassador¦139499 of Yeshua the messiah according¦139506 to God's will and with the promise¦139507 of life¦139509 in Yeshua the messiah.
\v 2 \add It's written\add* to my dear child¦139516, Timothy¦139514,\x + \xo 1:2: \xt Acts 16:1.\x*. May you experience grace¦139517, mercy¦139518, and peace¦139519 from God the father¦139522 and our¦139530 master¦139529 Yeshua¦139526 the messiah¦139525.
\s1 Advice and encouragement
\p
\v 3 I've been serving¦139536 God with a clean conscience¦139542 since my¦139553 childhood and I'm thankful to him that night¦139554 and day¦139556 I haven't stopped praying for you¦139548—
\v 4 remembering¦139560 your¦139561 tears¦139563 and longing¦139557 to see¦139559 you again which will fill me with happiness.
\v 5 I recall your faith¦139574 without hypocrisy which I first¦139577 noticed in your grandmother¦139580 Lois and in your mother¦139585 Eunice\x + \xo 1:5: \xt Acts 16:1.\x* and which I'm sure is also in you.
\v 6 So that's why I'm reminding¦139597 you to rekindle¦139599 God's gift¦139602 which you received when I placed my¦139613 hands¦139614 on you \add and prayed for you\add*,
\v 7 because God didn't give us a fearful spirit¦139622, but gave¦139618 us power¦139625, love¦139627, and wisdom.
\p
\v 8 So because of that, don't be ashamed¦139632 of the our¦139637 master's¦139636 testimony¦139634, and nor of mine even though I'm a prisoner¦139641 for him¦139642, but¦139643 let the two of us suffer¦139644 together¦139644 for the sake of the good¦139646 message¦139646 with the help of God's power¦139648.
\v 9 It's God that saved¦139651 us and called¦139654 us to live a godly life. His selection of us had nothing to do with anything good we might have done, but rather he has his own purposes¦139665 and had given¦139669 us grace¦139667 via Yeshua the messiah¦139672 even before¦139674 time began.
\v 10 That grace has been revealed¦139678 now that our¦139685 saviour¦139685 Yeshua¦139688 the messiah¦139687 appeared¦139683 and obliterated death¦139693 while at the same time illuminating¦139694 life¦139696 and immortality through¦139699 the good¦139701 message¦139701
\v 11 that I was appointed¦139704\x + \xo 1:11: \xt 1Tim 2:7.\x* to proclaim¦139707, as well as being an ambassador¦139709 and teacher¦139711.
\p
\v 12 It for that cause¦139715 that I am suffering¦139718 \add here in prison\add*, but I'm not ashamed¦139721 because I know who it is that I trust and I'm convinced that he is powerful¦139729 enough to guard¦139734 my¦139733 deposit¦139732 \add of hope in him\add* until the end \add of this age\add*.
\v 13 The style of sound¦139741 messages¦139742 that you heard¦139746 from me, you need to retain in faith¦139748 in Yeshua¦139754 the messiah¦139753, and with your love¦139750 for him.
\v 14 Keep that good¦139756 deposit¦139758 with the help of the pure spirit¦139761 who lives in us.
\p
\v 15 You've already heard that those in Asia \add Minor\add* all turned¦139771 their backs on me, including Phygelus and¦139781 Hermogenes¦139782.
\v 16 May the master¦139786 show mercy¦139784 to Onesiphorus and his¦139798 family because¦139791 he often¦139792 cheered me up and he wasn't ashamed¦139800 of my¦139798 chains¦139797.
\v 17 When he came to Rome he actively searched for me and found¦139813 me.
\v 18 May the master show him his mercy¦139819 on the \add judgement\add* day¦139825, but anyway, you well know how much he helped us in Ephesus.
\c 2
\s1 Yeshua's followers obey and endure
\p
\v 1 So my¦139838 ‘son’, may the grace¦139842 from Yeshua the messiah¦139845 make you¦139835 strong
\v 2 along with everything you¦139849 heard¦139849 from me through¦139852 many witnesses¦139854. Entrust those things¦139848 to faithful¦139857 people¦139858 who will also be capable of teaching¦139864 others¦139863.
\p
\v 3 Suffer¦139868 together¦139868 \add with me\add* as a good¦139870 soldier¦139871 of Yeshua¦139873 the messiah¦139872.
\v 4 Soldiers stay unentangled from the affairs¦139881 of daily living¦139880 so that they will \add be dedicated to\add* pleasing¦139885 their commanding officer.
\v 5 Similarly \add the athlete\add* won't win the competition¦139889 if they don't follow the rules.
\v 6 It's fair for the farmer¦139899 working \add in the orchard\add* to be allowed to eat the fruit¦139904.
\v 7 You should easily understand¦139906 what I'm saying¦139909 because the master¦139915 will be giving¦139911 you¦139913 insight¦139916 into everything.
\p
\v 8 Always remember¦139919 the \add promised\add* descendant of King David, Yeshua¦139920 the messiah¦139921 who came back from the dead¦139924, which is what I preach
\v 9 and why I'm here in chains suffering¦139934 hardship¦139934 as a criminal¦139938. But God's message¦139941 hasn't been chained.
\v 10 So I will endure¦139949 everything so that the ones that \add God has\add* chosen will also be able to receive their¦139950 salvation¦139956 in Yeshua¦139961 the messiah¦139960 and live with him forever.
\v 11 There's a reliable saying¦139967 that goes, 
\q1 If we died¦139970 along with him,
\q2 we will live together with him.
\q1
\v 12 \x + \xo 2:12: \xt Mat 10:33; Luk 12:9.\x*If we endure¦139974 with him,
\q2 we will be able to reign¦139977 with him.
\q1 If we disown him,
\q2 he will also disown us.
\q1
\v 13 If we refuse to believe him,
\q2 he will remain¦139988 faithful¦139987 \add to us\add*,
\q1 because he isn't able to go against his nature.
\m
\v 14 Keep reminding¦139995 them of all that. Tell them before¦139998 God not to quibble¦140004\f + \fr 2:14 \ft There's a textual issue here and we follow the standard SR (with ‘expert override’) rather than the developmental version.\f* about \add the intracies of\add* words as it's not helpful and can lead the listeners to ruin.
\s1 Being God's honourable slave
\p
\v 15 Work hard so that God will see you as someone he¦140023 approves¦140015 of—not ashamed of the \add good message¦140024\add* but straight-talking¦140022 the truth¦140026.
\v 16 Avoid chatter about unimportant or crude topics because it will eventually led to godlessness.
\v 17 Those kinds of talk are like rot that spreads¦140043, as happened when Hymenaeus and Philetus
\v 18 deviated¦140054 from the truth¦140053 by claiming that the resurrection¦140057 has already¦140058 happened and¦140060 have drawn some away from the faith¦140064.
\v 19 However God's solid¦140071 foundation¦140073 has stood¦140077 with this inscription on it: ‘The master knew his¦140087 own ones,’\x + \xo 2:19: \xt Num 16:5.\x* and ‘Let everyone¦140092 who claims to follow the master avoid disobedience.’
\p
\v 20 An expensive home doesn't just have gold and silver¦140110 bowls, but there¦140105 are wooden¦140113 and pottery bowls as well. Some will contain valuable things, but others¦140122 contain dishonourable¦140124 things \add that we prefer not to display\add*.
\v 21 So those people who rid themselves of dishonourable \add thoughts and actions\add* will become a container for honorable things¦140131, being reserved to do the special work that the master¦140140 has prepared¦140145 for them.
\v 22 And run far from youthful¦140148 lusts¦140149—chase instead after obedience, faith¦140155, love¦140156, and peace¦140157 like all the others who follow the master¦140164 with a pure heart¦140167.
\v 23 Refuse to enter foolish¦140170 and¦140171 uneducated¦140172 debates¦140173 because they'll just end in an argument.
\v 24 It's not fitting¦140183 one of the master's¦140181 slaves¦140179 to be argumentative, but¦140185 rather to be polite to everyone and to be teaching¦140190 the truth yet be tolerant of other people's bad behaviour. 
\v 25 We should politely point out the wrongs of those opposing¦140197 us and perhaps¦140199 God might bring them to repentance¦140205 and the knowledge¦140207 of the truth¦140208.
\v 26 After being caught¦140218 in the devil's¦140216 trap just as he wanted, maybe they'll escape and come to their¦140215 senses.
\c 3
\s1 Loss of standards in the end times
\p
\v 1 It's important to know that dangerous¦140235 times¦140234 will be coming in the last days¦140232 \add of this era\add*.
\v 2 People will become selfish¦140240, greedy for money¦140241, braggers¦140242, proud¦140243, slanderous¦140244, refusing to listen to sense from their¦140245 parents¦140245, ungrateful¦140248, ungodly,
\v 3 unloving¦140250, unwilling to reconcile, diabolical¦140252, angry, wild, and without morals.
\v 4 They will be betrayers¦140257, reckless¦140258 and conceited¦140259, loving pleasure¦140263 instead of loving God,
\v 5 appearing¦140268 to be godly on the surface yet denying that God is real, and¦140275 turning¦140277 from the truth.
\v 6 Some of these¦140279 will quietly enter houses¦140287 and¦140288 captivate¦140289 gullible women¦140292. Despite being¦140296 known for their sins¦140294, they're led by various¦140300 lusts¦140297—
\v 7 always¦140301 ‘learning’ yet never¦140304 actually confronting \add the reality of\add* the truth¦140307.
\v 8 This is just like how Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses,\x + \xo 3:8: \xt Possibly the Egyptian magicians of Exo 7:11.\x* and similarly these¦140321 people¦140325, having¦140326 depraved¦140326 minds and who are unqualified¦140329 concerning¦140330 the faith¦140332, oppose the truth¦140324.
\v 9 But they¦140335 won't be advancing \add in the faith\add* because their¦140342 foolishness will eventually become evident¦140343 to everyone, just as happened with \add Jannes and Jambres\add*.
\s1 Living your faith even at a cost
\p
\v 10 However \add Timothy\add*, you¦140351 followed¦140354 me in your teaching¦140357, your conduct¦140359, your purpose¦140361 and your faith¦140363, in patience¦140365, love¦140367, endurance¦140369,
\v 11 and even through persecution and suffering¦140373 like I endured in Antioch¦140379, Iconium, and Lystra\x + \xo 3:11: a \xt Acts 13:14-52; \xo b \xt Acts 14:1-7; \xo c \xt Acts 14:8-20.\x*—yet the master¦140393 rescued¦140391 me in each case.
\v 12 Anyway, everyone who wants to seriously follow Yeshua the messiah¦140403 should expect to be persecuted¦140405.
\p
\v 13 Meanwhile evil¦140406 people¦140408 and scammers will get worse and worse—deceiving¦140415 others and then being¦140417 deceived themselves.
\v 14 Hold on to the things¦140422 that you learnt and were convinced¦140425 was true, because you know you can trust those who taught them to you.
\v 15 You've known¦140438 the sacred¦140436 scriptures since you were a young child, and the wisdom contained in them is able to lead you to salvation¦140444 through¦140445 faith¦140446 in Yeshua¦140450 the messiah¦140449.
\v 16 All scripture¦140452 is inspired by God and useful for teaching, for scolding and correction¦140462, and for teaching discipline¦140464 and obedience
\v 17 so that the person¦140474 following God can be trained in doing every¦140476 kind of good¦140478 deed.
\c 4
\p
\v 1-2 I am proclaiming these truths before God and before Yeshua the messiah¦140489 who will judge both the living¦140495 and the dead¦140497. Proclaim his appearance¦140501 \add on earth\add*\f + \fr 4:1 \ft It's not clear if Paul is referring to Yeshua's previous coming to the earth, or to the expected, future coming. (See also 4:8)\f* and his kingdom¦140505, stand by the message whether it's convenient or seems out of place, rebuke and scold \add* those who need it\add*, but \add also\add* encourage with complete patience and teaching.
\v 3 A time¦140525 will come when people will no longer be tolerating¦140532 scriptural teaching, but will prefer their own doctrines so they'll find teachers¦140542 to teach what they want to hear,
\v 4 so not only will they avoid hearing¦140552 the truth¦140550, they'll be following myths¦140558 instead.
\v 5 However \add Timothy\add*, you stay sensible about everything, endure¦140565 hardship¦140565, tell people the good¦140573 message¦140573, and do all your¦140573 duties well.
\p
\v 6 As for me, I've already¦140580 done all I can and¦140582 the time¦140584 of my¦140588 departure¦140587 is approaching¦140589.
\v 7 I've fought¦140595 the fight¦140594 for goodness. I've finished¦140598 the race. I've kept¦140601 the faith¦140600.
\v 8 I know that a crown¦140608 has been reserved for me due to my¦140632 obedience, and the master¦140613 serving as the impartial judge¦140620 will award it to me, and not just to me, but will also award them to others who appreciated his¦140632 coming.\f + \fr 4:8 \ft Again (see 4:1), it's not totally clear if Paul is referring to Yeshua's previous coming to the earth, or to the expected, future coming.\f*
\s1 Final bits and pieces
\p
\v 9 Try to come¦140634 to me as soon as possible
\v 10 because Demas was attracted back to worldly things and so he¦140644 left me and went to Thessalonica¦140650. Crescens has gone to Galatia, and Titus went to Dalmatia¦140657.\x + \xo 4:10: a \xt Col 4:14; Phm 24; \xo b \xt 2Cor 8:23; Gal 2:3; Tit 1:4.\x*
\v 11 Only Luke stayed with me. Fetch Mark on your way and bring¦140665 him¦140665 to me also because he's always very helpful.\x + \xo 4:11: a \xt Col 4:14; Phm 24; \xo b \xt Acts 12:12,25; 13:13; 15:37-39; Col 4:10; Phm 24.\x*
\v 12 I sent¦140677 Tychicus to Ephesus.\x + \xo 4:12: \xt Acts 20:4; Eph 6:21-22; Col 4:7-8.\x*
\v 13 When you come, bring¦140689 the coat that I left with Carpas in Troas,\x + \xo 4:13: \xt Acts 20:6.\x* along with the scrolls¦140692 and¦140690 most of the parchments¦140695.\f + \fr 4:13 \ft We get no clues here about what scrolls they were (possibly some Hebrew scriptures), nor what was on the parchments—they may even have been still blank for writing on.\f*
\p
\v 14 Alexander¦140696 the coppersmith¦140698 did a lot of harm to me\x + \xo 4:14: a \xt 1Tim 1:20; \xo b \xt Psa 62:12; Rom 2:6.\x* but the master¦140707 will ‘reward’ him for what he's done.
\v 15 You also should watch out for him, because he¦140719 was very strongly opposed to our¦140721 teaching.
\p
\v 16 At my¦140726 first¦140725 defense¦140727 \add in the courts here in Rome\add*, no one stood with me. Everyone deserted me but¦140732 that shouldn't be held against them.
\v 17 But the master¦140741 stood¦140743 by me and strengthened¦140745 me to ensure that the good message was proclaimed¦140751 and all the pagans¦140758 heard it, and I was rescued¦140760 out of the lion's mouth¦140762 so to speak.
\v 18 The master¦140768 will rescue¦140765 me from every¦140770 evil¦140772 plot and he will bring me into his¦140778 heavenly¦140780 kingdom¦140777. He should be praised for ever. May¦140790 it¦140790 be so¦140790.
\s1 Signing off
\p
\v 19 Greet¦140791 Priscilla and Aquila for me, and Onesiphorus' household¦140798.\x + \xo 4:19: a \xt Acts 18:2; \xo b \xt 2Tim 1:16-17.\x*
\v 20 Erastus¦140799 stayed in Corinth, and I left Trophimus in Miletus because he was sick.\x + \xo 4:20: a \xt Acts 19:22; Rom 16:23; \xo b \xt Acts 20:4; 21:29.\x*
\v 21 Make sure you come¦140812 before¦140810 the winter¦140811. Eubulus greets¦140813 you, as do Pudens, Linus, Claudia, and all the believers.
\p
\v 22 May you always know inside that the master¦140827 is with you, and may all of you there experience God's grace¦140835.
