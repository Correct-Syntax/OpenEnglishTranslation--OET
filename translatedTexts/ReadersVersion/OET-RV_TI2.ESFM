\is1 Introduction
\ip This is \bk the second letter of Paul that we have that's written to Timothy\bk*. He wrote it from Rome when he was imprisoned there as a result of his preaching about Yeshua the messiah. Timothy was still teaching the believers in Ephesus, so here Paul requests him to come to see him before he gets sentenced to death.
\ip In this letter, Paul advised Timothy to be strong so that he can persevere in his preaching and doing God's work even in the middle of suffering and when others oppose him. He also warns Timothy about the coming evil of teachers of false doctrines because these can destroy the faith of the listeners.
\ip Most of all, Paul reminds Timothy about his life so that Paul's faith and endurance would be an example for Timothy to follow: his humility, his love, and his enduring suffering from those who persecuted him.

\v 1 \add This letter is from\add* Paul¦139499, an ambassador¦139500 of Yeshua the messiah according¦139507 to God's will and with the promise¦139508 of life¦139510 in Yeshua the messiah.
\v 2 \add It's written\add* to my dear child¦139517, Timothy¦139515,\x + \xo 1:2: \xt Acts 16:1.\x*. May you experience grace¦139518, mercy¦139519, and peace¦139520 from God¦139522 the father¦139523 and our¦139531 master¦139530 Yeshua¦139527 the messiah¦139526.
\s1 Advice and encouragement
\p
\v 3 I've been serving¦139537 God¦139535 with a clean conscience¦139543 since my¦139554 childhood and I'm thankful to him that night¦139555 and day¦139557 I haven't stopped praying for you¦139549—
\v 4 remembering¦139561 your¦139562 tears¦139564 and longing¦139558 to see¦139560 you again which will fill me with happiness.
\v 5 I recall your faith¦139575 without hypocrisy which I first¦139578 noticed in your grandmother¦139581 Lois and in your mother¦139586 Eunice\x + \xo 1:5: \xt Acts 16:1.\x* and which I'm sure is also in you.
\v 6 So that's why I'm reminding¦139598 you to rekindle¦139600 God's gift¦139603 which you received when I placed my¦139616 hands¦139615 on you \add and prayed for you\add*,
\v 7 because God¦139622 didn't give us a fearful spirit¦139623, but gave¦139619 us power¦139626, love¦139628, and wisdom.
\p
\v 8 So because¦139646 of that, don't¦139631 be ashamed¦139633 of the our¦139638 master's¦139637 testimony¦139635, and nor of mine even though I'm a prisoner¦139642 for him¦139643, but¦139644 let the two of us suffer¦139645 together¦139645 for the sake of the good¦139647 message¦139647 with the help of God's power¦139649.
\v 9 It's God that saved¦139652 us and called¦139655 us to live a godly life. His selection of us had nothing to do with anything good we might have done, but rather he has his own purposes¦139666 and had given¦139670 us grace¦139668 via Yeshua¦139674 the messiah¦139673 even before¦139675 time began.
\v 10 That grace has been revealed¦139679 now that our¦139686 saviour¦139686 Yeshua¦139689 the messiah¦139688 appeared¦139684 and obliterated death¦139694 while at the same time illuminating¦139695 life¦139697 and immortality through¦139700 the good¦139702 message¦139702
\v 11 that I was appointed¦139705\x + \xo 1:11: \xt 1Tim 2:7.\x* to proclaim¦139708, as well as being an ambassador¦139710 and teacher¦139712.
\p
\v 12 It for that cause¦139716 that I am suffering¦139719 \add here in prison\add*, but I'm not ashamed¦139722 because¦139724 I know who it is that I trust and I'm convinced that he is powerful¦139730 enough to guard¦139735 my¦139734 deposit¦139733 \add of hope in him\add* until the end \add of this age\add*.
\v 13 The style of sound¦139742 messages¦139743 that you heard¦139747 from me, you need to retain in faith¦139749 in Yeshua¦139755 the messiah¦139754, and with your love¦139751 for him.
\v 14 Keep that good¦139757 deposit¦139759 with the help of the pure¦139763 spirit¦139762 who lives in us.
\p
\v 15 You've already heard that those in Asia \add Minor\add* all turned¦139772 their backs on me, including Phygelus and¦139782 Hermogenes¦139783.
\v 16 May the master¦139787 show mercy¦139785 to Onesiphorus and his family because¦139792 he often¦139793 cheered me up and he wasn't ashamed¦139801 of my¦139799 chains¦139798.
\v 17 When he came to Rome he actively searched for me and found¦139814 me.
\v 18 May the master show him his mercy¦139820 on the \add judgement\add* day¦139826, but anyway, you well know how much he helped us in Ephesus¦139830.
\c 2
\s1 Yeshua's followers obey and endure
\p
\v 1 So my¦139839 ‘son’, may the grace¦139843 from Yeshua¦139847 the messiah¦139846 make you¦139836 strong
\v 2 along with everything you¦139850 heard¦139850 from me through¦139853 many witnesses¦139855. Entrust those things¦139849 to faithful¦139858 people¦139859 who will also be capable of teaching¦139865 others¦139864.
\p
\v 3 Suffer¦139869 together¦139869 \add with me\add* as a good¦139871 soldier¦139872 of Yeshua¦139874 the messiah¦139873.
\v 4 Soldiers stay unentangled from the affairs¦139882 of daily living¦139881 so that they will \add be dedicated to\add* pleasing¦139886 their commanding officer.
\v 5 Similarly \add the athlete\add* won't win the competition¦139890 if they don't¦139892 follow the rules.
\v 6 It's fair for the farmer¦139900 working \add in the orchard\add* to be allowed to eat the fruit¦139905.
\v 7 You should easily understand¦139907 what I'm saying¦139910 because¦139913 the master¦139916 will be giving¦139912 you¦139914 insight¦139917 into everything.
\p
\v 8 Always remember¦139920 the \add promised\add* descendant of King David¦139928, Yeshua¦139921 the messiah¦139922 who came back from the dead¦139925, which is what I preach
\v 9 and why I'm here in chains suffering¦139935 hardship¦139935 as a criminal¦139939. But God's message¦139942 hasn't been chained.
\v 10 So I will endure¦139950 everything so that the ones that \add God has\add* chosen will also be able to receive their salvation¦139957 in Yeshua¦139962 the messiah¦139961 and live with him forever.
\v 11 There's a reliable saying¦139968 that goes, 
\q1 If we died¦139971 along with him,
\q2 we will live together with him.
\q1
\v 12 \x + \xo 2:12: \xt Mat 10:33; Luk 12:9.\x*If we endure¦139975 with him,
\q2 we will be able to reign¦139977 with him.
\q1 If we disown him,
\q2 he will also disown us.
\q1
\v 13 If we refuse to believe him,
\q2 he will remain¦139989 faithful¦139988 \add to us\add*,
\q1 because¦139991 he isn't able to go against his nature.
\m
\v 14 Keep reminding¦139996 them of all that. Tell them before¦139999 God¦140001 not to quibble¦140004\f + \fr 2:14 \ft There's a textual issue here and we follow the standard SR (with ‘expert override’) rather than the developmental version.\f* about¦140004 \add the intracies of\add* words as it's not helpful and can lead the listeners to ruin.
\s1 Being God's honourable slave
\p
\v 15 Work hard so that God¦140020 will see you as someone he¦140024 approves¦140016 of—not ashamed of the \add good message¦140025\add* but straight-talking¦140023 the truth¦140027.
\v 16 Avoid chatter about unimportant or crude topics because¦140035 it will eventually led to godlessness.
\v 17 Those kinds of talk are like rot that spreads¦140044, as happened when Hymenaeus and Philetus
\v 18 deviated¦140055 from the truth¦140054 by claiming that the resurrection¦140058 has already¦140059 happened and¦140061 have drawn some away from the faith¦140065.
\v 19 However God's solid¦140072 foundation¦140074 has stood¦140078 with this inscription on it: ‘The master knew his¦140088 own ones,’\x + \xo 2:19: \xt Num 16:5.\x* and ‘Let everyone¦140093 who claims to follow the master avoid disobedience.’
\p
\v 20 An expensive home doesn't just have gold and silver¦140111 bowls, but there¦140106 are wooden¦140114 and pottery bowls as well. Some will contain valuable things, but others¦140123 contain dishonourable¦140125 things \add that we prefer not to display\add*.
\v 21 So those people who rid themselves of dishonourable \add thoughts and actions\add* will become a container for honorable things¦140132, being reserved to do the special work that the master¦140141 has prepared¦140146 for them.
\v 22 And run far from youthful¦140149 lusts¦140150—chase instead after obedience, faith¦140156, love¦140157, and peace¦140158 like all the others who follow the master¦140165 with a pure heart¦140168.
\v 23 Refuse to enter foolish¦140171 and¦140172 uneducated¦140173 debates¦140174 because they'll just end in an argument.
\v 24 It's not fitting¦140184 one of the master's¦140182 slaves¦140180 to be argumentative, but¦140186 rather to be polite to everyone and to be teaching¦140191 the truth yet be tolerant of other people's bad behaviour. 
\v 25 We should politely point out the wrongs of those opposing¦140198 us and perhaps¦140200 God¦140205 might bring them to repentance¦140206 and the knowledge¦140208 of the truth¦140209.
\v 26 After being caught¦140219 in the devil's¦140217 trap just as he wanted, maybe they'll escape and come to their senses.
\c 3
\s1 Loss of standards in the end times
\p
\v 1 It's important to know that dangerous¦140236 times¦140235 will be coming in the last days¦140233 \add of this era\add*.
\v 2 People will become selfish¦140241, greedy for money¦140242, braggers¦140243, proud¦140244, slanderous¦140245, refusing to listen to sense from their¦140246 parents¦140246, ungrateful¦140249, ungodly,
\v 3 unloving¦140251, unwilling to reconcile, diabolical¦140253, angry, wild, and without morals.
\v 4 They will be betrayers¦140258, reckless¦140259 and conceited¦140260, loving pleasure¦140264 instead of loving God¦140267,
\v 5 appearing¦140269 to be godly on the surface yet denying that God is real, and¦140276 turning¦140278 from the truth.
\v 6 Some of these¦140280 will quietly enter houses¦140288 and¦140289 captivate¦140290 gullible women¦140293. Despite being¦140297 known for their sins¦140295, they're led by various¦140301 lusts¦140298—
\v 7 always¦140302 ‘learning¦140303’ yet never¦140305 actually confronting \add the reality of\add* the truth¦140308.
\v 8 This is just like how Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses,\x + \xo 3:8: \xt Possibly the Egyptian magicians of Exo 7:11.\x* and similarly these¦140322 people¦140326, having¦140327 depraved¦140327 minds and who are unqualified¦140330 concerning¦140331 the faith¦140333, oppose the truth¦140325.
\v 9 But they¦140336 won't be advancing \add in the faith\add* because¦140340 their¦140343 foolishness will eventually become evident¦140344 to everyone, just as happened with \add Jannes and Jambres\add*.
\s1 Living your faith even at a cost
\p
\v 10 However \add Timothy\add*, you¦140352 followed¦140355 me in your teaching¦140358, your conduct¦140360, your purpose¦140362 and your faith¦140364, in patience¦140366, love¦140368, endurance¦140370,
\v 11 and even through persecution and suffering¦140374 like I endured in Antioch¦140380, Iconium, and Lystra\x + \xo 3:11: a \xt Acts 13:14-52; \xo b \xt Acts 14:1-7; \xo c \xt Acts 14:8-20.\x*—yet the master¦140394 rescued¦140392 me in each case.
\v 12 Anyway, everyone who wants to seriously follow Yeshua¦140405 the messiah¦140404 should expect to be persecuted¦140406.
\p
\v 13 Meanwhile evil¦140407 people¦140409 and scammers will get worse and worse—deceiving¦140416 others and then being¦140418 deceived themselves.
\v 14 Hold on to the things¦140423 that you learnt and were convinced¦140426 was true, because you know you can trust those who taught them to you.
\v 15 You've known¦140439 the sacred¦140437 scriptures since you were a young child, and the wisdom contained in them is able to lead you to salvation¦140445 through¦140446 faith¦140447 in Yeshua¦140451 the messiah¦140450.
\v 16 All scripture¦140453 is inspired by God and useful for teaching, for scolding and correction¦140463, and for teaching discipline¦140465 and obedience
\v 17 so that the person¦140475 following God¦140474 can be trained in doing every¦140477 kind of good¦140479 deed.
\c 4
\p
\v 1-2 I am proclaiming these truths before God¦140486 and before Yeshua the messiah¦140490 who will judge both the living¦140496 and the dead¦140498. Proclaim his appearance¦140502 \add on earth\add*\f + \fr 4:1 \ft It's not clear if Paul is referring to Yeshua's previous coming to the earth, or to the expected, future coming. (See also 4:8)\f* and his kingdom¦140506, stand by the message whether it's convenient or seems out of place, rebuke and scold \add* those who need it\add*, but \add also\add* encourage with complete patience and teaching.
\v 3 A time¦140526 will come when people will no longer be tolerating¦140533 scriptural teaching, but will prefer their own doctrines so they'll find teachers¦140543 to teach what they want to hear,
\v 4 so not only will they avoid hearing¦140553 the truth¦140551, they'll be following myths¦140559 instead.
\v 5 However \add Timothy\add*, you stay sensible about everything, endure hardship¦140566, tell people the good¦140574 message¦140574, and do all your¦140577 duties well.
\p
\v 6 As for me, I've already¦140581 done all I can and¦140583 the time¦140585 of my¦140589 departure¦140588 is approaching¦140590.
\v 7 I've fought¦140596 the fight¦140595 for goodness. I've finished¦140599 the race. I've kept¦140602 the faith¦140601.
\v 8 I know that a crown¦140609 has been reserved for me due to my obedience, and the master¦140614 serving as the impartial judge¦140621 will award it to me, and not just to me, but will also award them to others who appreciated his¦140633 coming.\f + \fr 4:8 \ft Again (see 4:1), it's not totally clear if Paul is referring to Yeshua's previous coming to the earth, or to the expected, future coming.\f*
\s1 Final bits and pieces
\p
\v 9 Try to come¦140635 to me as soon as possible
\v 10 because Demas was attracted back to worldly things and so he¦140645 left me and went to Thessalonica¦140651. Crescens has gone to Galatia¦140655, and Titus went to Dalmatia¦140658.\x + \xo 4:10: a \xt Col 4:14; Phm 24; \xo b \xt 2Cor 8:23; Gal 2:3; Tit 1:4.\x*
\v 11 Only Luke stayed with me. Fetch Mark on your way and bring¦140666 him¦140666 to me also because¦140671 he's always very helpful.\x + \xo 4:11: a \xt Col 4:14; Phm 24; \xo b \xt Acts 12:12,25; 13:13; 15:37-39; Col 4:10; Phm 24.\x*
\v 12 I sent¦140678 Tychicus to Ephesus¦140680.\x + \xo 4:12: \xt Acts 20:4; Eph 6:21-22; Col 4:7-8.\x*
\v 13 When you come, bring¦140690 the coat that I left with Carpas in Troas,\x + \xo 4:13: \xt Acts 20:6.\x* along with the scrolls and¦140691 most of the parchments.\f + \fr 4:13 \ft We get no clues here about what scrolls they were (possibly some Hebrew scriptures), nor what was on the parchments—they may even have been still blank for writing on.\f*
\p
\v 14 Alexander¦140697 the coppersmith¦140699 did a lot of harm to me\x + \xo 4:14: a \xt 1Tim 1:20; \xo b \xt Psa 62:12; Rom 2:6.\x* but the master¦140708 will ‘reward’ him for what he's done.
\v 15 You also should watch out for him, because¦140718 he¦140720 was very strongly opposed to our¦140722 teaching.
\p
\v 16 At my¦140727 first¦140726 defense¦140728 \add in the courts here in Rome\add*, no one stood with me. Everyone deserted me but¦140733 that shouldn't be held against them.
\v 17 But the master¦140742 stood¦140744 by me and strengthened¦140746 me to ensure that the good message was proclaimed¦140752 and all the pagans¦140759 heard it, and I was rescued¦140761 out of the lion's mouth¦140763 so to speak.
\v 18 The master¦140769 will rescue¦140766 me from every¦140771 evil¦140773 plot and he will bring me into his¦140779 heavenly¦140781 kingdom¦140778. He should be praised for ever. May¦140791 it¦140791 be so¦140791.
\s1 Signing off
\p
\v 19 Greet¦140792 Priscilla and Aquila for me, and Onesiphorus' household¦140799.\x + \xo 4:19: a \xt Acts 18:2; \xo b \xt 2Tim 1:16-17.\x*
\v 20 Erastus¦140800 stayed in Corinth, and I left Trophimus in Miletus because he was sick.\x + \xo 4:20: a \xt Acts 19:22; Rom 16:23; \xo b \xt Acts 20:4; 21:29.\x*
\v 21 Make sure you come¦140813 before¦140811 the winter¦140812. Eubulus greets¦140814 you, as do Pudens, Linus, Claudia, and all the believers¦140825.
\p
\v 22 May you always know inside that the master¦140828 is with you, and may all of you there experience God's grace¦140836.
