\p
\v 1 Long ago, \nd God¦141906\nd* spoke¦141907 to \add our\add* ancestors¦141909 through the prophets¦141913 in many different circumstances and in many different ways,
\v 2 but in these¦141919 last days¦141918 he spoke¦141920 to us through \add his\add* son who he appointed¦141925 to inherit everything. It was also through him that he made the different eras—
\v 3 \add through the son\add* who radiates¦141937 \add the father's\add* splendour and represents¦141941 his reality¦141943. \add The son\add* bears everything by the message¦141951 of his power¦141953, and after having¦141963 made \add a way to be\add* purified¦141958 from our sins¦141961, he sat¦141964 down in heaven next to God in the seat of the second-in-command.
\s1 The son is greater than the angels
\rem /s1 The Greatness of God's Son; Christ Is Greater Than the Angels
\p
\v 4 By having¦141974 become¦141974 so much better¦141973 than \add God's\add* messengers¦141976, he inherited¦141981 a greater reputation than them,
\rem /s1 The Son Is Superior to Angels
\v 5 because¦142002 which¦141983 of the messengers¦141988 was told \add even\add* once \add by God\add*:\x + \xo 1:5: a \xt Psa 2:7; \xo b \xt 2Sam 7:14; 1Ch 17:13.\x*
\q1 ‘You are my¦141990 son;
\q1 I gave birth to you today¦141994.’
\m And again¦141998:
\q1 ‘I will be a father¦142003 to him,
\q1 And he will be a son to me.’
\m
\v 6 Then when \add \nd God¦142026\nd*\add* brings¦142014 his firstborn¦142016 \add son\add* into the world¦142019 he said:\x + \xo 1:6: \xt Deu 32:43 (LXX).\x*
\q1 ‘Let all of God's messengers¦142025 bow down to him.’
\m
\v 7 On one hand¦142029 he said to \add his\add* messengers:\x + \xo 1:7: \xt Psa 104:4 (LXX).\x*
\q1 ‘The \add one\add* making his messengers winds,
\q2 and \add making\add* his ministers¦142041 a fiery flame¦142044.’
\m
\v 8 And on the other¦142046 hand¦142046 to \add his\add* son he said:\x + \xo 1:8-9: \xt Psa 45:6-7.\x*
\q1 ‘\nd God¦142053\nd*, your¦142051 throne¦142050 \add will last\add* to the end of the ages;
\q1 The ruler of his kingdom¦142067 is a ruler of justice.
\q1
\v 9 You loved¦142070 righteousness¦142071 and hated¦142073 lawlessness¦142075,
\q1 because¦142076 of this, God, your God, honoured you
\q2 with gladness beyond¦142088 \add what\add* your companions¦142090 \add received\add*.’
\m
\v 10 He also said \add to his son\add*:\x + \xo 1:10-12: \xt Psa 102:25-27 (LXX).\x*
\q1 ‘\nd Master¦142096\nd*, at the beginning¦142095 you established¦142099 the earth¦142098,
\q1 and you made the heavens¦142107 with your¦142104 hands¦142103.
\q1
\v 11 They will perish¦142109 but¦142111 you¦142110 will continue¦142112;
\q1 They will wear out like clothes do.
\q1
\v 12 You will roll them up like a \add discarded\add* dressing gown;
\q2 they'll be changed like \add we\add* change our clothes.
\q1 But you \add remain\add* the same¦142132,
\q1 and you won't get old and fragile.’
\m
\v 13 To which¦142141 of \add his\add* messengers¦142144 did God say even once:\x + \xo 1:13: \xt Psa 110:1.\x*
\q1 ‘Sit \add in the seat of honour\add* on my right¦142149,
\q1 until¦142151 I can \add defeat\add* your¦142156 enemies¦142155
\q2 and use them as a stool for my feet¦142159’?
\m
\v 14 \add See, those messengers are just\add* ministering¦142164 spirits¦142165 sent¦142169 out to serve those people who will inherit¦142173 salvation¦142174.

\rem /s1 A Warning against Drifting Away; Warning to Pay Attention; The Great Salvation
\p
\v 1 Because¦142175 of that, it's much more appropriate¦142177 for us to listen carefully to the \add message\add* so we¦142186 don't drift¦142186 away.
\v 2 Because if the message¦142193 that was brought by the messengers¦142191 is confirmed¦142195 and \add so\add* every¦142197 transgression¦142198 and \add act of\add* disobedience¦142200 received¦142201 the appropriate penalty¦142203,
\v 3 how will \em we\em* escape¦142206 \add punishment\add* if we neglect¦142209 such a great¦142208 \add offer of\add* salvation. This salvation was first heard when spoken¦142214 about by the \nd master¦142217\nd* and then others who heard confirmed¦142223 it to us
\v 4 and \nd God¦142228\nd* testified¦142225 it by means of sign and wonders¦142232 and various¦142234 miracles¦142235 and by gifts of the holy \nd spirit¦142237\nd* whenever he wanted.
\s1 Salvation through Yeshua
\rem /s1 Jesus Made Like His Brothers; Exaltation through Abasement; Jesus, the Man; The One Who Leads Us to Salvation
\p
\v 5 It's not \add his\add* messengers¦142247 that \add God\add* put in charge of the future world¦142252 that we're talking¦142257 about,
\v 6 but someone¦142261 testified¦142258 somewhere¦142260 saying¦142262:\x + \xo 2:6-8: \xt Psa 8:4-6.\x*
\q1 ‘What is humankind that you think about him,
\q1 or humanity's son that you notice¦142274 him?
\q1
\v 7 You made him a little¦142278 less than \add your\add* messengers¦142282.
\q1 You crowned¦142286 him with splendour and honour¦142285.
\q1
\v 8 You put everything under his authority.’
\m By putting everything under his authority, nothing¦142312 is left that he doesn't control, although \add right\add* now we don't¦142319 see everything being under his authority yet.
\v 9 But although he was made a little¦142327 lower than \add God's\add* messengers¦142330, we see \nd Yeshua¦142333\nd* have suffered¦142336 death, \add now\add* crowned¦142342 with splendour and honour¦142341, so that by God's grace¦142345, he experienced death for everyone¦142348.
\v 10 It was appropriate for him, the one who everything was made for and who made everything, having¦142367 brought¦142367 many children to be with God and being the originator¦142369 of their¦142372 salvation¦142371, to become perfect¦142375 through¦142373 what he suffered¦142374.
\p
\v 11 Both the person who is making people holy and the ones being made holy are \add part of\add* one \add family\add* because¦142386 he's not ashamed¦142390 to call them brothers¦142391 and sisters¦142391
\v 12 saying¦142394:\x + \xo 2:12: \xt Psa 22:22.\x*
\q1 ‘I will announce your¦142398 name¦142397 to my¦142401 brothers¦142400,
\q1 I will sing praise songs to you from the middle of the assembly¦142404.’
\m
\v 13 And also:\x + \xo 2:13: \xt Isa 8:17 (LXX)\x*
\q1 ‘I will trust¦142411 \add myself\add* to him¦142413.’
\m And:\x + \xo 2:13: \xt Isa 8:18.\x*
\q1 ‘Look, it's me with the little¦142420 children¦142420 that \nd God¦142426\nd* gave¦142424 me.’
\p
\v 14 So because¦142427 the ‘little¦142430 children¦142430’ are \add all made of\add* flesh¦142435 and blood¦142432, he also \add became a man\add* to be just like them, so that through¦142444 his death, he could nullify¦142447 the power¦142450 of death (which \add comes from\add* the devil¦142457)
\v 15 and¦142458 set free all those who in a lifetime ‘slavery¦142471’ \add controlled\add* by the fear¦142463 of death¦142464.
\v 16 You can be certain that it's not \add God's\add* messengers¦142475 that he's helped, but¦142477 rather Abraham's descendants.\x + \xo 2:16: \xt Isa 41:8-9.\x*
\v 17 That's why he had to be just like his brothers¦142486 and sisters¦142486, so that he could become¦142490 \add the\add* merciful¦142489 and faithful¦142492 chief¦142493 priest¦142493 \add representing\add* \nd God¦142497\nd*, in order to pay the price for the people's¦142506 sins¦142503.
\v 18 Because he also suffered¦142510 when he was tempted \add to sin\add*, he's able to help¦142516 others who're tempted.

\s1 Yeshua is greater than Moses
\rem /s1 Jesus Is Greater Than Moses; Jesus Greater Than Moses; Moses a Servant, Christ a Son; Jesus, the faithful high priest
\p
\v 1 Therefore, godly brothers¦142518 and sisters¦142518, who \add share in\add* the heavenly¦142521 calling¦142520, consider \nd Yeshua¦142533\nd*, who we acknowledge as our¦142531 missionary and high priest¦142527,
\v 2 how he was faithful to \add God\add* who appointed him, just as Moses was faithful in God's house¦142546.\x + \xo 3:2: \xt Num 12:7.\x*
\v 3 \add Yeshua\add* was considered¦142555 worthy¦142555 of more honour than Moses, just like the builder of a house is honoured more than the house itself¦142564,
\v 4 because every house¦142571 is made by someone¦142574, but¦142576 the one who made everything is \nd God¦142582\nd*.
\v 5 On one hand¦142586, Moses was faithful¦142587 in all of his¦142592 house¦142591, thus serving as a testimony¦142596 for what was yet to be told,
\v 6 and on the other¦142600 hand¦142600, \nd Messiah¦142599\nd* was \add the\add* son over his¦142606 house, which is us if we retain¦142626 our confidence¦142617 and the expectation of our hope.

\p
\v 7 Therefore¦142627 the holy \nd spirit¦142631\nd* says:\x + \xo 3:7-11: \xt Psa 95:7-11 (LXX).\x*
\q1 ‘Today¦142634 if you¦142640 hear¦142640 his¦142639 voice¦142637,
\q1
\v 8 don't¦142641 harden¦142642 your¦142645 hearts¦142644 as \add you did\add* in the rebellion¦142650,
\q1 in the time of testing in the wilderness¦142658
\q1
\v 9 where¦142659 your¦142665 ancestors¦142663 tested¦142660 \add me\add* through trials¦142667,
\q1 although they¦142671 saw¦142671 my¦142674 actions
\v 10 over forty¦142675 years¦142676.
\m That's why I was angry¦142678 with that generation¦142680 and I said:
\q1 ‘They're always straying¦142687 in their¦142689 hearts¦142690 and they don't¦142695 \add really\add* know my¦142699 ways.’
\m
\v 11 As I decided in my severe¦142704 anger¦142704:
\q1 ‘They will never be entering into my peace.’
\p
\v 12 Brothers¦142713 and sisters, watch¦142712 out in case any of you has an evil¦142720 heart¦142719 with unbelief¦142721 \add which leads you\add* to withdraw¦142724 from the living¦142727 \nd God¦142726\nd*.
\v 13 Instead urge yourselves¦142731 \add on\add* throughout¦142732 each day (while it's still called¦142739 ‘today¦142738’) so that some of you won't become hardened¦142742 by the sin's seduction¦142747
\v 14 because we are now partakers¦142752 of the \nd messiah¦142756\nd* if we can retain¦142767 until¦142764 the end¦142765 the assurance¦142762 that we had at the beginning¦142760.
\v 15 As it's been said¦142770:\x + \xo 3:15: \xt Psa 95:7-8 (LXX).\x*
\q1 ‘Today¦142771 if you all hear¦142776 his¦142775 voice¦142774,
\q1 don't¦142777 harden¦142778 your¦142781 hearts¦142780 as you did when you rebelled¦142785.’
\m
\v 16 Did some people heard¦142788 and yet rebel¦142789? Didn't Moses lead all of the people out of Egypt¦142796?\x + \xo 3:16-18: \xt Num 14:1-35.\x*
\v 17 Who was he angry¦142802 with for forty¦142803 years¦142804? Wasn't it the people who disobeyed God and who died there in the wilderness¦142815?
\v 18 And who did God promise that they wouldn't enter his¦142824 rest, if it wasn't the people who disbelieved¦142829?
\v 19 So we¦142831 can \add now\add* see that they¦142834 weren't able to enter \add the promised land\add* because¦142837 of their unbelief¦142838.

\s1 Entering God's rest/peace
\rem /s1 Promised Rest for God's People; The Rest That God Promised; A Sabbath-Rest for the People of God
\p
\v 1 That's why we might be afraid¦142839: because although we had a promise¦142843 to enter his¦142848 rest, some of you¦142852 might fail to achieve it,
\v 2 because we've already had the good message preached¦142858 \add to us\add* just like them, but the message they heard¦142877 didn't benefit¦142863 them because they weren't united¦142870 in faith¦142875 with the \add others\add* who listened.
\v 3 So those of us who believed¦142886 are entering that rest, as he said¦142888:\x + \xo 4:3: \xt Psa 95:11.\x*
\q1 ‘As I promised in my severe¦142893 anger¦142893,
\q1 They will never enter into my rest.’
\m And yet he's had it \add ready\add* since the creation of the world¦142906.
\v 4 For somewhere¦142910 he's spoken¦142908 about the seventh \add day saying\add*:\x + \xo 4:4: \xt Gen 2:2.\x*
\q1 ‘And on the seventh day \nd God¦142918\nd* rested¦142916 from all his¦142928 works¦142927.’
\m
\v 5 And also:\x + \xo 4:5: \xt Psa 95:11.\x*
\q1 ‘They will never enter my¦142938 rest.’
\m
\v 6 Therefore¦142940 because it's being¦142941 retained¦142941 for some people to \add still\add* come into it, and those who previously¦142948 had the good message¦142949 preached¦142949 to them didn't come in because of \add their\add* disbelief¦142954,
\v 7 \add God\add* designated¦142957 a certain¦142956 day saying¦142963:\x + \xo 4:7: \xt Psa 95:7-8 (LXX).\x*
\q1 ‘Today¦142971 if you all hear his¦142975 voice¦142974,
\q1 Don't harden¦142978 your¦142981 hearts¦142980.’
\p
\v 8 Because if Yoshua had given them rest,\x + \xo 4:8: \xt Deu 31:7; Josh 22:4.\x* \add God\add* wouldn't¦142989 be speaking¦142992 afterwards¦142993 about¦142990 another¦142991 day¦142996.
\v 9 So then, a time of rest is being¦142999 retained¦142999 for God's people¦143002,
\v 10 because anyone having¦143007 come¦143007 into their rest, also rests from their works, just as \nd God¦143024\nd* rested¦143014 from his¦143011 own works.\x + \xo 4:10: \xt Gen 2:2.\x*
\v 11 Therefore¦143026 we¦143025 should be earnest¦143025 about entering that rest, in case someone¦143037 else falls \add by following our\add* example¦143038 of disbelief¦143042,
\v 12 because God's message¦143047 is living¦143043 and active¦143051 and sharper¦143053 than any high-quality sword¦143056, even penetrating¦143059 to divide the soul¦143062 and spirit¦143065—\add like\add* separating the bone from sinews—and able to judge¦143071 a person's inner thoughts¦143072 and intentions¦143075.
\v 13 There isn't anything in all of creation¦143080 that's hidden¦143081 from him, but everything is naked¦143086 and exposed¦143088 to his¦143091 sight \add as\add* he's the one we have to give an account¦143096 to.

\v 14 So then, having \nd Yeshua¦143106\nd* the son of \nd God¦143110\nd* who came from and returned to the heavens¦143105 as our high priest¦143099, we need to hold firmly to what we say we believe,
\v 15 because we don't¦143114 have a high priest¦143117 who's not able to sympathise¦143120 with our¦143123 weakness¦143122, but rather who's been tempted¦143124 just like we are yet he didn't sin¦143132.
\v 16 Therefore¦143134 we can boldly approach¦143133 the throne¦143138 of grace to receive¦143142 mercy¦143144 and find grace to help us when we need it.

\v 2 He's able to be patient with those who don't¦143176 understand and stray¦143178 \add from the truth\add* because¦143179 he also is subject to weakness¦143183
\v 3 and because¦143185 of that, he has to make offerings¦143198 for his own sins¦143202 as well as for the people¦143192.\x + \xo 5:3: \xt Lev 9:7.\x*

\v 4 No one takes that honour¦143209 upon themself, but¦143210 they're called¦143212 by \nd God¦143215\nd* like just Aaron was.\x + \xo 5:4: \xt Exo 28:1.\x*

\s1 Melchizedek, the special priest
\rem /s1 Melchizedek Is Compared to Abraham; The Priest Melchizedek; The Priestly Order of Melchizedek; Melchizedek the Priest
\p
\v 1 This Melchizedek was the king¦143728 of \add the city of\add* Salem and a priest¦143731 of \nd God¦143733\nd*, the highest¦143735 one.\x + \xo 7:1-2: \xt Gen 14:17-20.\x* He met Abraham¦143740 who was returning¦143741 from slaughtering¦143744 \add several\add* kings¦143746 and Melchizedek blessed¦143748 him¦143749,
\v 2 and Abraham¦143759 gave him a tenth¦143752 of all the captured goods. \add The name Melchizedek\add* means ‘king of righteousness¦143764’ and then king of Salem also means ‘king of peace¦143775’.
\v 3 \add There's no record of his\add* father¦143776 or mother¦143777, no genealogical¦143778 background, and no \add record of his\add* being born or dying, but he's likened¦143786 to God's son in that he continually¦143796 remains¦143792 as a priest¦143793.
\p
\v 4 Notice how great¦143799 this Melchizedek was, \add because\add* the patriarch¦143811 Abraham¦143804 gave¦143805 him a tenth¦143803 of the best of the captured goods.
\v 5 On one hand¦143814, the tithing¦143825 commandment¦143822 from \add Moses'\add* law makes the people¦143827 give a tenth to Levi's descendants who inherit the priestly¦143820 office¦143820, even though they're their¦143835 brothers¦143834 as \add fellow\add* descendants of Abraham¦143841.\x + \xo 7:5: \xt Num 18:21.\x*
\v 6 On the other¦143843 hand¦143843, Abraham tithed¦143848 to Melchizedek who can't be traced¦143845 as one of them, and he blessed¦143856 Abraham who had received \add God's\add* promises¦143855.
\v 7 There's no doubt that it's the lessor¦143864 \add person\add* that gets blessed¦143868 by \add someone\add* greater.
\v 8 So in the first case, the tenth is received¦143875 by people¦143874 who die, but in the second case by someone who it's \add only\add* testified that he lives.
\v 9 You could even say¦143884 that even Levi¦143890 (whose descendants receive¦143893 the tenths) gave a tenth \add to Melchizedek\add* through¦143886 Abraham¦143887
\v 10 because Levi's \add sperm\add* was still¦143895 part of his father's¦143901 body when Melchizedek met Abraham.

\rem /s1 Jesus Like Melchizedek; Another Priest, Like Melchizedek
\p
\v 11 Indeed if perfection¦143911 came from the priesthood from Levi's tribe¦143914 which was legislated¦143924 \add to help\add* the people¦143918, why would there¦143910 have still¦143926 been a need for another¦143932 to rise up as a priest¦143934 in the order of Melchizedek and¦143935 not \add just\add* from the order of Aaron?
\v 12 Because if the priesthood¦143945 is changed, then \add that\add* law would also need to be changed.
\v 13 The one that we're talking about here is from another¦143960 tribe, and no one from that tribe has ever served¦143966 \add as a priest\add* at the altar¦143969.
\p
\v 14 So it's quite¦143970 evident¦143970 that our¦143978 \nd master¦143977\nd* came from Judah's tribe but Moses never mentioned priests¦143984 coming from that tribe,
\rem /s1 Christ Is like Melchizedek
\rem /s1 Another Priest, like Melchizedek
\v 15 and it's even more clear if another¦144003 priest¦144002 like Melchizedek¦143999 rose up
\v 16 who didn't live by the physical law \add (of death)\add* but¦144013 according to the power¦144015 of indestructable¦144017 life¦144016!
\v 17 Because it's been testified¦144019:\x + \xo 7:17: \xt Psa 110:4.\x*
\q1 ‘You are priest¦144024 to this age,
\q1 according¦144028 to the order¦144030 of Melchizedek.’
\m
\v 18 In the first case, the commandment¦144037 is annulled¦144032 because¦144038 it's weak and unprofitable¦144043
\v 19 (because¦144046 the law made nothing¦144045 perfect¦144047), and in the second case we have the introduction¦144050 of a better¦144052 hope by means of which¦144055 we can approach \nd God¦144059\nd*.
\p
\v 20 And it wasn't done without an oath, because¦144070 although \add men\add* become¦144075 priests¦144074 without an oath,
\v 21 but \add Yeshua became a priest\add* by an oath from the one that said:\x + \xo 7:21: \xt Psa 110:4.\x*
\q1 ‘The \nd master¦144086\nd* made an oath
\q2 and won't rescind it.
\q1 You are priest for this age.’
\m
\v 22 Because of that oath, \nd Yeshua¦144109\nd* became the guarantor¦144108 of a better¦144105 agreement¦144106.
\p
\v 23 in the first case, there have been many of those priests¦144116 because¦144118 death¦144120 doesn't allow them to continue¦144122 on,
\v 24 but in the second case, because¦144125 \add Yeshua\add* stays alive for \add all\add* the age, he can hold the office of priest¦144135 permanently¦144132
\v 25 and thus he's able to save those who approach¦144145 \nd God¦144149\nd* through¦144146 him—save them to the full extent¦144142 because¦144155 he always¦144150 lives to intercede of their behalf.
\p
\v 26 Such a high priest¦144162 exactly meets our needs: one who is godly¦144163, innocent¦144164, pure, set apart from sinners¦144170, and¦144171 honoured above the heavens¦144174.
\v 27 Unlike the \add other\add* high priests¦144184, it's not necessary¦144181 for him to first make a sacrifice¦144190 for his own sins before doing it for the sins of the people¦144195,\x + \xo 7:27: \xt Lev 9:7.\x* because¦144197 he offered¦144191 himself¦144201—once for everyone¦144179.
\v 28 The law appoints those with weaknesses¦144213 as high priests¦144211, but¦144216 the message¦144215 from the oath which¦144219 followed after¦144220 the law, appointed \add the\add* son who has been perfected¦144227 for the age.

\p
\v 1 So \add here's the main\add* point¦144228 in what we're saying: we have a high priest¦144236 who sat¦144238 down in the honoured seat beside the majesty's¦144244 throne¦144242 in the heavens¦144247\x + \xo 8:1: \xt Psa 110:1.\x*
\v 2 and ministers¦144250 in the holy places¦144249 and in the true tent \add of worship\add* which¦144257 the \nd master¦144260\nd* erected, not people.
\v 3 Every high priest¦144267 is appointed¦144275 to be offering both gifts¦144271 and sacrifices¦144274, and so it's necessary¦144277 for this one to also have something¦144279 to offer.
\v 4 If he was \add here\add* on earth¦144290, he wouldn't even be a priest¦144294 \add because there¦144286 are others\add* offering¦144299 gifts¦144304 according¦144300 to \add Moses'\add* law.
\v 5 They serve a copy or shadow¦144308 of the heavenly¦144311 realms¦144311 just as Moses was warned¦144313 when he was about to start making¦144324 the tent \add of worship\add*:\x + \xo 8:5: \xt Exo 25:40.\x*
\q1 ‘Make everything according¦144327 to the pattern¦144329 that I showed you on the mountain¦144335.’
\m
\v 6 But on the contrary, \add Yeshua\add* has obtained¦144340 a more special¦144339 ministry¦144342 because he's the mediator¦144349 of a better agreement which¦144350 has been legislated¦144354 with better promises¦144353.
\p
\v 7 If the first¦144358 agreement had been faultless, then there wouldn't¦144363 have been any need to find a second¦144365 one to replace it,
\v 8 but \add God\add* blamed \add the people\add* and said:\x + \xo 8:8-12: \xt Jer 31:31-34 (LXX).\x*
\q1 “Listen, the \nd master¦144377\nd* declares that the time is coming¦144375 when I will make a new agreement with Israel and Yudah,
\q1
\v 9 not like the agreement that I master with their¦144400 ancestors¦144399
\q2 when they held my hand¦144407 for me to lead them out of Egypt¦144413,
\q1 because¦144414 they didn't stay inside my agreement
\q2 and \add so\add* I didn't take any notice of them, says the master.’
\q1
\v 10 So this is the agreement that I make with Israel after¦144437 those¦144440 times, says the \nd master¦144442\nd*,
\q1 putting my laws into their minds and writing them onto their hearts¦144452,
\q1 and I will be their \nd God¦144464\nd* and they¦144466 will be my people¦144471.
\q1
\v 11 Then they¦144475 certainly won't teach¦144475 each citizen¦144480 and¦144483 their¦144504 neigbours,
\q1 saying¦144488 ‘Know the \nd master¦144493\nd*,’
\q1 because¦144494 all of them from the smallest to the greatest¦144503 will all know me.
\q1
\v 12 Because¦144505 I'll be merciful¦144506 to them when they disobey,
\q1 and¦144511 certainly I won't remember their¦144510 sins¦144513 any longer.”
\m
\v 13 In calling that ‘new’, he's made the first¦144529 \add agreement\add* out-of-date, and what's out-of-date and getting old is about to disappear¦144536.

\v 1 The first¦144542 \add agreement\add* had sacred¦144546 rites and¦144548 a holy \add place¦144549 here\add* on earth¦144550,

\v 6 And then with all of that having¦144643 been prepared¦144643, the priests¦144654 entered¦144652 past everything¦144650 in the first¦144647 room of the tent to carry out their sacred¦144656 services¦144656.\x + \xo 9:6: \xt Num 18:2-6.\x*
\v 7 However, only the high priest¦144667 enters the second¦144661 room, and then only once a year¦144664.

\v 12 he went once-for-all into the holy places¦144780—not by the blood of goats¦144765 and calves¦144767 but through¦144768 his own blood—obtaining eternal¦144781 redemption¦144783 \add for us\add*.

\v 16 Where there's an agreement \add like a will\add*, it's necessary¦144871 for the death¦144870 of the one who made it,

\v 22 and¦144973 almost¦144964 everything was \add declared\add* ‘clean¦144969’ according¦144970 to the law, because there couldn't be forgiveness¦144982 without blood¦144966.\x + \xo 9:22: \xt Lev 17:11.\x*
\rem /s1 Christ's Sacrifice Takes Away Sins; Jesus, the final sacrifice
\p
\v 23 So then it was necessary¦144983 for these copies¦144987 of things from the heavens¦144991 to be purified, but in contrast, the heavenly things will be purified with better¦144998 sacrifices¦144999 than that,
\v 24 because¦145027 \nd Messiah¦145011\nd* didn't enter human-made holy places¦145009 that were only representatives¦145012 of the true ones, but he entered into heaven¦145019 where he now appears on our behalf in God's presence¦145023.
\v 25 He didn't offer¦145033 himself¦145035 like the high priest¦145038 does every¦145043 year¦145044 with different blood¦145046,
\v 26 otherwise¦145048 he would have needed to suffer¦145052 over and over since the creation of the world¦145055. Instead he appeared just once throughout all the ages because¦145064 sin¦145067 has been annulled¦145065 by his¦145071 sacrifice¦145070.
\v 27 Just as it's been determined that people¦145078 will die¦145080 once and¦145082 then there'll be judgement,
\v 28 so too the \nd messiah¦145088\nd* was offered once \add as a sacrifice\add* as an offering for the sins¦145095 of many people,\x + \xo 9:28: \xt Isa 53:12.\x* but will be seen¦145100 a second¦145097 time¦145097 (nothing to do with sin¦145099) by those who're eagerly¦145103 waiting¦145103 for him¦145102.
\c 10
\s1 The messiah's sacrifice is once-for-all
\rem /s1 Christ's Sacrifice Once for All
\p
\v 1 The law is a shadow¦145109 of the good¦145116 things coming¦145115, not the \add exact\add* image¦145121 of them. Every year¦145125 they¦145131 offer¦145131 the same¦145127 sacrifices¦145128—over and over but never¦145136 getting nearer to perfection¦145141,
\v 2 otherwise they could have stopped offering¦145147 them because¦145148 once they were fully ‘clean¦145158’, they wouldn't¦145144 have needed anymore¦145152 \add sacrifices to appease\add* the conscience¦145153 of \add their\add* sins¦145154.
\v 3 But as it is, every¦145165 year¦145166 there's¦145162 a reminder about \add their\add* sins¦145164
\v 4 because¦145169 it's \add simply\add* not possible for the blood¦145169 of goats¦145173 and¦145172 bulls¦145170 to take away sins¦145177.
\p
\v 5 That's why when \add Yeshua\add* came into the world¦145182, he said:\x + \xo 10:5-7: \xt Psa 40:6-8 (LXX).\x*
\q1 “You don't¦145187 want sacrifice and offering¦145186,
\q1 but you prepared¦145191 a body¦145189 for me.
\q1
\v 6 You took¦145199 no pleasure¦145199 in whole burnt¦145193 offerings¦145193 and¦145195 \add sacrifices¦145195\add* for sin¦145197.
\q1
\v 7 Then I said, ‘Listen, it's been written¦145208 about me in the scroll of the scriptures. I have come, \nd God¦145215\nd*, to do whatever you want.’ ”
\m
\v 8 Previously he had said, ‘You don't want sacrifices and offerings and burnt¦145229 offerings and offerings for sin¦145232, and you didn't take pleasure¦145236 in them,’ even though they're offered according¦145239 to the law.
\v 9 Then he said¦145244, ‘Listen, I'm coming¦145246 to do whatever you want.’ So he was terminating the first¦145256 \add agreement\add* in order¦145257 to be able to establish¦145260 the second¦145259 one.
\v 10 By that agreement, we¦145265 are made holy once-and-for-all through¦145267 the offering¦145269 of \nd Yeshua¦145274\nd* Messiah's body¦145272.
\p
\v 11 In fact, every priest¦145283 has stood¦145284 there every day¦145287 ministering¦145288 and¦145289 often¦145292 offering¦145293 the same¦145291 sacrifices¦145294,\x + \xo 10:11: \xt Exo 29:38.\x* \add all of\add* which¦145295 have never¦145296 been able to remove sins¦145299,
\v 12 but this one offered¦145307 one sacrifice¦145308 for sins¦145306 for all time, then sat¦145312 down on God's right¦145315\x + \xo 10:12-13: \xt Psa 110:1.\x*
\v 13 waiting even now until¦145322 his¦145326 enemies¦145325 are overcome
\v 14 Yes, with one sacrifice, he's able to make people holy for all time.
\p
\v 15 The holy \nd spirit¦145347\nd* also testifies¦145342 to us, having said¦145353:
\q1
\v 16 \x + \xo 10:16: \xt Jer 31:33.\x*‘The \nd master¦145368\nd* says: This is the agreement that I will make with them:
\q1 I will put my¦145371 laws into their hearts¦145373 and also I will write them into their minds.’
\m
\v 17 And,\x + \xo 10:17: \xt Jer 31:34.\x* ‘I won't remember their disobedience and their lawlessness¦145391 any more.’
\v 18 Once there's been forgiveness¦145402, then there's no longer¦145404 \add a need for\add* an offering¦145405 for sin¦145407.
\s1 Don't give up on your faith
\rem /s1 A Call to Persevere; Let Us Come Near to God
\p
\v 19 Therefore¦145410 brothers¦145411 and¦145411 sisters¦145411, \add we\add* have confidence¦145412 to enter the holy place¦145417 by \nd Yeshua's¦145421\nd* blood¦145420—
\v 20 a new and life-giving path¦145425 that he initiated for us \add to go\add* through¦145429 the curtain¦145431, which¦145422 is his¦145436 flesh¦145435.
\v 21 \add Since\add* we have an incredible priest¦145438 \add presiding\add* over God's house¦145442,
\v 22 we can approach¦145445 \add God\add* with sincere hearts in full assurance¦145453 \add due to our\add* faith¦145454, having our hearts sprinkled¦145455 \add to clean us\add* from our guilty consciences¦145460 and with our bodies having been washed¦145463 in clean water¦145467.\x + \xo 10:22: \xt Lev 8:30; Eze 36:25.\x*
\v 23 We can hold onto the confession¦145471 of our¦145472 unwavering¦145475 hope because¦145477 the one who made the promise¦145479 is faithful¦145476,
\v 24 and we¦145481 can be considering how to provoke¦145486 each other to \add show\add* love¦145488 and to \add do\add* good¦145490 things—
\v 25 not giving up meeting together¦145497 as some have, but¦145504 \add rather\add* encouraging each other even more as you¦145511 all see the day¦145514 \add of judgement\add* coming closer.
\p
\v 26 If we keep on sinning¦145517 after¦145520 learning about the truth¦145527, then there's no sacrifice¦145534 left for our¦145519 sins¦145530,
\v 27 but¦145536 the certain¦145537 expectation¦145538 of fearful¦145535 judgement and¦145540 of a fiery anger that will consume¦145543 the god-haters.\x + \xo 10:27: \xt Isa 26:11 (LXX).\x*
\v 28 Anyone who rejected¦145547 Moses' law would receive the death sentence without¦145551 mercy by \add the strength of\add* two¦145554 or three¦145556 witnesses¦145557,\x + \xo 10:28: \xt Deu 17:6; 19:15.\x*
\v 29 so how much more severe punishment¦145565 do you¦145560 all expect might be considered appropriate for someone who trampled¦145571 God's son underfoot and who has considered the blood¦145574 of the agreement as cheap\x + \xo 10:29: \xt Exo 24:8.\x* and who has insulted¦145587 the \nd spirit¦145584\nd* of grace¦145586?
\v 30 Yes, we¦145588 know who said¦145591,\x + \xo 10:30: a \xt Deu 32:35; \xo b \xt Deu 32:36.\x* ‘Vengeance is mine—I'm the one who'll repay¦145595 \add them\add*,’ and¦145598 again¦145599, ‘The \nd master¦145602\nd* will be judging¦145601 his¦145605 people¦145604.’
\v 31 It's a scary thing to fall into the hands¦145610 of the living¦145612 \nd God¦145611\nd*.
\p
\v 32 Remember those earlier¦145616 days¦145618 when you first learnt \add about Messiah\add* and how you endured¦145625 a lot of suffering¦145626—
\v 33 sometimes being publicly¦145633 displayed with derision¦145629 and persecution, and at other times helping others who were being treated like that.
\v 34 You all sympathised¦145647 with those who were imprisoned and cheerfully accepted¦145657 the confiscation of your¦145654 possessions because you knew that you have a better¦145666 possession that will endure on.
\v 35 So then, don't toss away your¦145678 boldness¦145676, because it'll lead to a sizeable reward¦145683.
\v 36 Rather you need to endure¦145684 so that when you've done what \nd God¦145694\nd* wants, you'll all receive¦145696 back what was promised¦145699
\v 37 because:\x + \xo 10:37-38: \xt Hab 2:3-4 (LXX).\x*
\q1 ‘In still¦145700 a little¦145702 while the one coming will come,
\q1 and won't be delaying¦145711.’
\m
\v 38 And:
\q1 ‘My¦145715 righteous¦145714 one will be living¦145718 by faith¦145717.
\q1 If he retreats, my¦145715 soul¦145727 won't be pleased¦145724 with him.’
\m
\v 39 But we¦145731 aren't from \add those\add* retreating back to destruction¦145737, but¦145739 from \add those\add* with faith¦145740 that preserves the soul¦145743.

\v 1 Now faith¦145746 is the assurance¦145748 that the things we hope for \add will come to pass\add* and the conviction¦145751 that \add even\add* what we can't see \add is real\add*,
\v 2 because¦145758 those are what our predecessors were commended for.

\rem /s1 The Examples of Abel, Enoch, and Noah
\p
\v 4 By faith Abel offered¦145785 a more satisfactory sacrifice¦145781 to God than Kain,\x + \xo 11:4: \xt Gen 4:3-10.\x* and as a result, he was declared to be righteous¦145792 when God testified¦145793 about his gifts¦145796, and through \add his faith\add*, he still¦145807 speaks¦145809 despite being \add long\add* dead.

\v 6 and without¦145838 faith¦145840 it's impossible¦145841 to please¦145842 him. Because it's necessary¦145845 for anyone who approaches¦145847 \nd God¦145849\nd* to believe¦145843 that he exists, and that he rewards¦145857 those who search for him.
