\is1 Introduction
\is2 Author
\ip This account about the works and teachings of Jesus was written by Mark, the son of a Jewish family who lived in Jerusalem. His mother was named Mary (Acts 12:12).
\ip Many people think he was John Mark, a cousin of Barnabas (Col. 4:10) who accompanied Paul on his first long-distance trip to spread the good news about Jesus the Messiah (Acts 12:25, 13:13). We also know that Mark accompanied Peter (1 Peter 5:13), and some consider that it might have been Peter who narrated to Mark what Jesus had done and taught.
\ip This account seems to have been written for non-Jews, especially perhaps those familiar with Roman customs. So he didn’t use much ink as Matthew or Luke explaining prophecies from the Jewish scriptures but he does, however, take time to explain Jewish customs to help non-Jewish readers.
\ip Mark explains here that Jesus came to serve both God and the people, and he often refers to him as the “Son of Man”. We can see that especially in 10:45: “...” Mark wants his readers to know that Jesus did incredible things, but especially focuses on his teaching. He confirms the power and authority of Jesus by telling about the miracles that he did, his healing of the sick, and his exorcism of demons.
\ip The ending of this narrative is often disputed, and scholars are still debating about whether or not the longer ending (16:9-20) is original. The \em OET\em* includes the disputed longer ending, but displays it in a smaller font to indicate its debatable status.

\v 1 Here begins the good news about Jesus the Messiah—the son of god:
\s1 The ministry of John the <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">dunker</span> immerser (The return of “Elijah”)
\r (Mat. 3:1-12; Luk. 3:1-18; Jhn. 1:19-28)
\p
\v 2 \x + \xo 1:2: \xt Mal 3:1.\x*The prophet Isaiah wrote:
\q1 “See, I’m sending my messenger to you,
\q1 the one who be be preparing your path.
\q1
\v 3 \x + \xo 1:3: \xt Isa 40:3 (LXX).\x*The voice out in the wilderness shouting,
\q2 ‘Get the path ready for the master;
\q2 Make it smooth for him to travel on.’ ”
\p
\v 4 John turned up in the wilderness announcing that people should get immersed in water in order to show that their sins have been forgiven.
\v 5 And many from the Judean region and from the city of Jerusalem went out to hear him, and they confessed their sins and asked John to immerse them in Jordan river.
\p
\v 6 \x + \xo 1:6: \xt 2Ki 1:8.\x*John was dressed in simple clothes made from camel hair with a leather belt around his waist, and he lived on locusts and wild honey.
\v 7 And he also announced that, “There’s a greater man coming soon—in fact I’m not even good enough to bend down and untie his sandals.
\v 8 I immersed you in water, but he will immerse you all in God’s pure spirit.”
\s1 Jesus gets immersed and then tempted
\r (Mat. 3:13–4:11; Luk. 3:21-22; 4:1-13)
\p
\v 9 Then one day Jesus came from Nazareth in the Galilee region, and he was immersed in the Jordan river by John.
\v 10 As Jesus came up out of the water, he saw the sky being opened up, and God’s spirit coming down on him like a dove.
\v 11 \x + \xo 1:11: \xt Gen 22:2; Psa 2:7; Isa 42:1; Mat 3:17; 12:18; Mrk 9:7; Luk 3:22.\x*And a voice came from the sky saying, “You are my son who I love and am pleased with.”
\p
\v 12 And then the spirit sent him into the wilderness
\v 13 where he was tested by Satan for forty days. He was out there with the wild animals, but angels waited on him there.
\s1 The selection of the first followers / apprentices
\r (Mat. 4:12-22; Luk. 4:14-15; 5:1-11)
\p
\v 14 After John had been arrested, Jesus went back to Galilee, announcing the good news from God
\v 15 \x + \xo 1:15: \xt Mat 3:2.\x*saying, “The promised time is here, and the kingdom of God is now near, so be turning from your sins and believing this good news.”
\p
\v 16 And as he went around the lake of Galilee, Jesus saw Simon and his brother Andrew throwing a net into the lake because they were fishermen.
\v 17 And he said to them, “Come with me and I will be making you fishermen of people.”
\v 18 And so they left their fishing and went off with Jesus.
\p
\v 19 Then a bit further on he saw James Zebedee and his brother John with him in a boat getting their nets ready.
\v 20 Jesus called them and they too went off with him, leaving their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired workers.
\s1 Jesus drives out a demon
\r (Luk. 4:31-37)
\p
\v 21 They went on into Capernaum where he went into the synagogue and began teaching as soon as the Sabbath started.
\v 22 \x + \xo 1:22: \xt Mat 7:28-29.\x*The congregation was amazed at his teaching, because he taught with authority, not like the regular teachers there.
\p
\v 23 Then a demon-possessed man in the synagogue suddenly yelled out,
\v 24 “What are we to you, Jesus of Nazareth? You’ve come to destroy us. I know that you’re God’s holy one.”
\p
\v 25 But Jesus scolded it, “Keep quiet!”, and, “Come out of him!”
\p
\v 26 Then the demon threw the man into a convulsion, cried out loudly, and left him.
\v 27 Everyone was astounded, and asked each other, “What just happened? We haven’t heard this before: he has authority to command demons, and they obey him!”
\p
\v 28 And the news about Jesus spread all over the entire region of Galilee.
\s1 Jesus heals many others
\r (Mat. 8:14-17; Luk. 4:38-41)
\p
\v 29 After leaving the synagogue, Jesus went into the home of Simon and Andrew, along with James and John.
\v 30 Inside, Simon’s mother-in-law was lying down with a fever, and the others spoke to Jesus about her.
\v 31 He went up to her, took hold of her hand, and helped her up. Then the fever subsided and she got them something to eat.
\p
\v 32 That evening when the sun set, the people brought all those who were sick or demon-possessed to Jesus.
\v 33 It seemed like the entire town had gathered there outside the front door.
\v 34 Jesus healed many who were sick from a range of diseases, and he threw out many demons—not allowing them to speak because they knew that he was the Messiah.
\s1 Jesus prays before going preaching
\r (Luk. 4:42-44)
\p
\v 35 In the small hours of the night, Jesus got up and went out to a solitary place and prayed there.
\v 36 But Simon and the others came looking for him,
\v 37 and when they found him they said, “Everyone’s looking for you!”
\p
\v 38 And Jesus answered, “Well, we’ll be going into the other villages around here, so that I can also tell them. That’s what I came here for.” 
\v 39 \x + \xo 1:39: \xt Mat 4:23; 9:35.\x*Then he went preaching in all their synagogues in Galilee and driving out demons.
\s1 Jesus heals a man with leprosy
\r (Mat. 8:1-4; Luk. 5:12-16)
\p
\v 40 A man with leprosy came to Jesus asking him, “I know that you could treat me if you wanted to.”
\p
\v 41 Jesus felt compassion for him, reached out his hand and touched him, and said, “Yes, I will. Get well.”
\v 42 Then immediately the leprosy was gone, and he was well again.
\v 43 So Jesus sent him away, but warned him:
\v 44 \x + \xo 1:44: \xt Lev 14:1-32.\x*“Don’t talk to anyone—just go to the priest and show him that you’re well, and as a testimony of that, make the offering that Moses commanded.”
\p
\v 45 But after the man left, he started telling lots of people and spreading the news—so much so that Jesus could no longer come into the town, but had to stay out in quieter places and people kept coming to him.
\c 2
\s1 Jesus heals a paralysed man
\r (Mat. 9:1-8; Luk. 5:17-26)
\p
\v 1 When Jesus came back to Capernaum after a few days, people soon heard that he was back in the house.
\v 2 And so many people turned up there that there wasn’t any room left—not even in the doorway. Inside, Jesus was explaining the Scriptures to them.
\v 3 Four men arrived, carrying a paralysed man to Jesus,
\v 4 but because of the crowd, they were unable to get close. So they climbed up onto the flat roof, made a hole through it, and lowered the paralysed man lying on a pallet.
\v 5 Jesus, observing their faith, said to the man, “Son, your sins are forgiven!”
\p
\v 6 But some of the synagogue teachers were sitting there, thinking to themselves,
\v 7 “Why’s he talking like that? He’s seriously insulting God. There’s only one who can forgive sins, and that’s God himself.”
\p
\v 8 Then Jesus, knowing in his spirit that they are thinking like that, said to them, “Why are you thinking that to yourselves?
\v 9 Which is easier: to tell the paralysed man that his sins have been forgiven, or to tell him to pick up his bedding and walk?”
\v 10 But so you all can see that the son of man has authority on the earth to be forgiving sins, he turned and said to the paralysed man,
\v 11 “Listen. Get up, take your bedding, and go home!”
\p
\v 12 So he stood up, and picked up his bedding, and went out of the house where everyone saw him and marvelled and praised God saying, “We’ve never seen anything like this happening before!”
\s1 The calling of Levi (Matthew)
\r (Mat. 9:9-13; Luk. 5:27-32)
\p
\v 13 Jesus went out beside the lake where crowds of people kept coming to him, and he taught them.
\v 14 And as he was passing by the tax office, he saw Levi Alphaeus sitting there and said to him, “Come along with me.” So Levi stood up and followed Jesus.
\p
\v 15 Jesus ended up having a meal at Levi’s place, and many other tax collectors and undesirables were sitting there also, along with Jesus’ followers, because by then many were following him around.
\v 16 And the teachers from the sect of the Pharisees noticed that Jesus was eating beside undesirables and tax collectors. So they asked his followers, “How come he eats with tax collectors and other low-life?” 
\p
\v 17 And overhearing them, Jesus said, “Healthy people don’t need a doctor—it’s the sick ones that do. I didn’t come here to call those considered to have no needs, but to call sinners.”
\s1 The question of fasting
\r (Mat. 9:14-17; Luk. 5:33-39)
\p
\v 18 Now the followers of John the Immerser and members of the Pharisees regularly fasted. So a small group came to Jesus and asked, “How come John’s followers and the Pharisees fast regularly, yet your followers don’t?”
\p
\v 19 And Jesus answered, “Can the friends of the groom fast when they’re celebrating along with him? No, as long as he’s still there, they won’t be fasting.
\v 20 But in the future, when the groom will be taken away from them, and \em then\em* they’ll be fasting.
\p
\v 21 “No one sews a patch of new, unshrunken cloth onto an old garment, because the new patch will tear away from that old fabric and it will end up as a worse tear.
\v 22 No one puts new wine into old wineskins, because the wine will burst the \add already stretched\add* wineskins, and both the wine and the wineskins will be destroyed. New wine must be put into \em new\em* wineskins.”
\s1 Working on the Rest Day
\r (Mat. 12:1-8; Luk. 6:1-5)
\p
\v 23 \x + \xo 2:23: \xt Deu 23:25.\x*And it so happened that Jesus and his followers passed through some fields of grain on some days of rest. As they went through, they plucked off some heads of grain.
\v 24 And some members of the Pharisees said, “It’s breaking the law to do that on a rest day!”
\p
\v 25 And Jesus replied, “You’ve read yourselves what David did when him and his men were hungry.
\v 26 \x + \xo 2:26: \xt Lev 24:9.\x*They went into God’s tent and ate the holy bread representing the presence of God. Only the priests were allowed to eat that, and yet David even gave some to his men!”
\v 27 And he told the Pharisees, “The days of rest were created for people, not people for the rest days.
\v 28 So I, the son of man, have authority also over the day of rest.”
\c 3
\s1 The man with the curled-up hand
\r (Mat. 12:9-14; Luk. 6:6-11)
\p
\v 1 And again another time, Jesus went to the synagogue and there was a man there with a curled-up hand.
\v 2 The synagogue leaders were watching him closely to see if he would heal the man on the rest day, and then if he did, they would have a case against him.
\v 3 Then Jesus said to the man with the flawed hand, “Stand up there in the middle.”
\v 4 And he asked the leaders, “Is it allowable to do good on the rest day, or only to do evil? To save life, or to kill.” But they didn’t reply.
\p
\v 5 After angrily looking around at them, grieving inside at their complete lack of compassion, he said to the man, “Open up your hand!”
\v 6 The man stretched out his fingers, and his hand was totally normal. But the Pharisees quickly left and meeting with King Herod’s supporters, they conspired to kill Jesus.
\s1 Big crowds press on Jesus
\p
\v 7 After that, Jesus withdrew towards the lake with his followers, and a huge crowd of people from the regions of both Galilee and down in Judea,
\v 8 along with others from Jerusalem, Idumea, across the Jordan River, and from up near Tyre and Sidon. They came because they had heard about the amazing things he had done.
\v 9 \x + \xo 3:9-10: \xt Mrk 4:1; Luk 5:1-3.\x*So Jesus asked his apprentices to organise a small boat for him to be there for him so he wouldn’t be cramped by the press of the crowd.
\v 10 Virtually anyone who had any physical issues was pressing towards him to touch him, because he had already healed so many.
\v 11 And the demons, whenever they saw Jesus, they fell down to the ground in front of him and yelled out, “You are God’s son!”
\v 12 But he regularly warned them not to reveal who he was.
\s1 Jesus appoints his twelve representatives
\r (Mat. 10:1-4; Luk. 6:12-16)
\p
\v 13 As Jesus started climbing up a hill, he called out the followers that he had selected, and they went off with him.
\v 14 He appointed twelve of them as his representatives so that they could stick with him and be sent off to be proclaiming his message
\v 15 and to also have authority to exorcise demons.
\p
\v 16 These are the twelve that he appointed: Simon (but he appended the name “Peter”), 
\v 17 Jacob and his brother John who were Zebedee’s sons (and he nicknamed them the “sons of thunder”),
\v 18 Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, Jacob Alphaeus, Thaddeus, Simon from Canaan,
\v 19 and Judas Iscariot who later betrayed him.
\s1 The two opposing spiritual powers
\r (Mat. 12:22-32; Luk. 11:14-23; 12:10)
\p
\v 20 Jesus was approaching a house, but the crowd swarmed them again so they had no opportunity to eat.
\v 21 The ones with him heard all the noise and came to get him, because they were wondering if he was crazy.
\p
\v 22 \x + \xo 3:22: \xt Mat 9:34; 10:25.\x*And the synagogue teachers had come up from Jerusalem and were complaining, “He’s possessed by the prince of demons. He can command them because he rules them!”
\p
\v 23 But Jesus addressed them: “How could Satan command himself?
\v 24 If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom could never prosper.
\v 25 If a household is divided against itself, that family will never prosper.
\v 26 So if Satan attacked himself and was split, he couldn’t possibly be powerful, but his time would be over.
\p
\v 27 On the contrary, no one can enter the house of a strong man to clean out his possessions unless he first ties up that strong man—after that he can work on the goods.
\p
\v 28 Honestly, I assure you that any sin of a person can be forgiven, no matter how much they curse God.
\v 29 \x + \xo 3:29: \xt Luk 12:10.\x*But whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit can never be forgiven, but is eternally responsible for their sin.   .”
\v 30 (He said this because they were saying that he was demon-possessed.)
\s1 Jesus’ mother and brothers arrive
\r (Mat. 12:46-50; Luk. 8:19-21)
\p
\v 31 Now Jesus’ mother and brothers came and were standing outside and asked someone to tell him that they were there.
\v 32 Some in the crowd sitting around him told Jesus that his mother and brothers were waiting outside for him.
\p
\v 33 But Jesus answered, “Who is my mother and who are my brothers?”
\v 34 And having looked around the people sitting here, he said, “Actually, you all are my mother and my brothers.
\v 35 For whoever obeys God, that person is my brother and my sister and my mother.”
\c 4
\s1 The allegory about planting seed
\r (Mat. 13:1-9; Luk. 8:4-8)
\p
\v 1 \x + \xo 4:1: \xt Luk 5:1-3.\x*Again Jesus started teaching by the edge of the lake. A huge crowd gathered around him, but he had boarded the boat floating in the water, and all the people were there on the land.
\v 2 And he taught them many different things in allegories, including this one:
\v 3 “Listen. Once there was a farmer who went to spread some seed.
\v 4 As he spread it, some landed on the path, and the birds came and feed on it.
\v 5 Some landed on a rocky part without a lot of soil, and it quickly sprouted in the warm, shallow soil,
\v 6 but when the sun came up, it dried out because the roots weren’t deep, and so it just withered up.
\v 7 Some of the seed landed in a thistle patch, and the thistles grew and choked it out, so the plants never bore a crop.
\v 8 But some seed landing in fertile soil and it bore a harvest--some thirty times as much, some sixty, and some a hundred times.”
\p
\v 9 Then Jesus added, “Whoever wants to understand, let them consider it.”
\s1 The peggamit of Jesus te panunggilingan
\r (Mat. 13:10-17; Luk. 8:9-10)
\p
\v 10 And when the crowd had left, the twelve apprentices asked him about the allegories.
\v 11 And he told them, “You’ve been given understanding about the kingdom of God, but for others, they’ll get it in allegories.
