\v 1 Here begins the good news about Jesus the Messiah—the son of god:
\s1 The ministry of John the dunker (The return of “Elijah”)
\r (Mat. 3:1-12; Luk. 3:1-18; Jhn. 1:19-28)
\p
\v 2 The prophet Isaiah wrote:
\q1 “See, I’m sending my messenger to you,
\q1 the one who be be preparing your path.
\q1
\v 3 The voice out in the desert shouting,
\q2 ‘Get the path ready for the master;
\q2 Make it smooth for him to travel on.’ ”
\p
\v 4 John turned up in the desert announcing that people should get immersed in water in order to show that their sins have been forgiven.
\v 5 And many from the Judean region and from the city of Jerusalem went out to hear him, and they confessed their sins and asked John to immerse them in Jordan river.
\v 6 John was dressed in simple clothes made from camel hair with a leather belt around his waist, and he lived on locusts and wild honey.
\v 7 And he also announced that, “There’s a greater man coming soon—in fact I’m not even good enough to bend down and untie his sandals.
\v 8 I immersed you in water, but he will immerse you all in God’s pure spirit.”
\s1 Jesus gets immersed and then tempted
\r (Mat. 3:13–4:11; Luk. 3:21-22; 4:1-13)
\p
\v 9 Then one day Jesus came from Nazareth in the Galilee region, and he was immersed in the Jordan river by John.
\v 10 As Jesus came up out of the water, he saw the sky being opened up, and God’s spirit coming down on him like a dove.
\v 11 And a voice came from the sky saying, “You are my son who I love and am pleased with.”
\p
\v 12 And then the spirit sent him into the desert
\v 13 where he was tested by Satan for forty days. He was out there with the wild animals, but angels waited on him there.
\s1 The selection of the first followers/apprentices
\r (Mat. 4:12-22; Luk. 4:14-15; 5:1-11)
\p
\v 14 After John had been arrested, Jesus went back to Galilee, announcing the good news from God
\v 15 saying, “The promised time is here, and the kingdom of God is now near, so be turning from your sins and believing this good news.”
\p
\v 16 And as he went around the lake of Galilee, Jesus saw Simon and his brother Andrew throwing a net into the lake because they were fishermen.
\v 17 And he said to them, “Come with me and I will be making you fishermen of people.”
\v 18 And so they left their fishing and went off with Jesus.
\p
\v 19 Then a bit further on he saw James Zebedee and his brother John with him in a boat getting their nets ready.
\v 20 Jesus called them and they too went off with him, leaving their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired workers.
\s1 Jesus drives out a demon
\r (Luk. 4:31-37)
\p
\v 21 They went on into Capernaum where he went into the synagogue and began teaching as soon as the Sabbath started.
\v 22 The congregation was amazed at his teaching, because he taught with authority, not like the regular teachers there.
\v 23 Then a demon-possessed man in the synagogue suddenly yelled out,
\v 24 “What are we to you, Jesus of Nazareth? You’ve come to destroy us. I know that you’re God’s holy one.”
\p
\v 25 But Jesus scolded it, “Keep quiet!”, and, “Come out of him!”
\v 26 Then the demon threw the man into a convulsion, cried out loudly, and left him.
\v 27 Everyone was astounded, and asked each other, “What just happened? We haven’t heard this before: he has authority to command demons, and they obey him!”
\v 28 And the news about Jesus spread all over the entire region of Galilee.
\s1 Jesus heals many others
\r (Mat. 8:14-17; Luk. 4:38-41)
\p
\v 29 After leaving the synagogue, Jesus went into the home of Simon and Andrew, along with James and John.
\v 30 Inside, Simon’s mother-in-law was lying down with a fever, and the others spoke to Jesus about her.
\v 31 He went up to her, took hold of her hand, and helped her up. Then the fever subsided and she got them something to eat.
\p
\v 32 That evening when the sun set, the people brought all those who were sick or demon-possessed to Jesus.
\v 33 It seemed like the entire town had gathered there outside the front door.
\v 34 Jesus healed many who were sick from a range of diseases, and he threw out many demons—not allowing them to speak because they knew that he was the Messiah.
\s1 Jesus prays before going preaching
\r (Luk. 4:42-44)
\p
\v 35 In the small hours of the night, Jesus got up and went out to a solitary place and prayed there.
\v 36 But Simon and the others came looking for him,
\v 37 and when they found him they said, “Everyone’s looking for you!”
\v 38 And Jesus answered, “Well, we’ll be going into the other villages around here, so that I can also tell them. That’s what I came here for.” 
\v 39 Then he went preaching in all their synagogues in Galilee and driving out demons.
\s1 Jesus heals a man with leprosy
\r (Mat. 8:1-4; Luk. 5:12-16)
\p
\v 40 A man with leprosy came to Jesus asking him, “I know that you could treat me if you wanted to.”
\v 41 Jesus felt compassion for him, reached out his hand and touched him, and said, “Yes, I will. Get well.”
\v 42 Then immediately the leprosy was gone, and he was well again.
\v 43 So Jesus sent him away, but warned him:
\v 44 “Don’t talk to anyone—just go to the priest and show him that you’re well, and as a testimony of that, make the offering that Moses commanded.”
\v 45 But after the man left, he started telling lots of people and spreading the news—so much so that Jesus could no longer come into the town, but had to stay out in quieter places and people kept coming to him.
\c 2
\s1 Jesus heals a paralysed man
\r (Mat. 9:1-8; Luk. 5:17-26)
\p
\v 1 When Jesus came back to Capernaum after a few days, people soon heard that he was back in the house.
\v 2 And so many people turned up there that there wasn’t any room left—not even in the doorway. Inside, Jesus was explaining the Scriptures to them.
\v 3 Four men arrived, carrying a paralysed man to Jesus,
\v 4 but because of the crowd, they were unable to get close. So they climbed up onto the flat roof, made a hole through it, and lowered the paralysed man lying on a pallet.
\v 5 Jesus, observing their faith, said to the man, “Son, your sins are forgiven!”
\v 6 But some of the synagogue teachers were sitting there, thinking to themselves,
\v 7 “Why’s he talking like that? He’s seriously insulting God. There’s only one who can forgive sins, and that’s God himself.”
\v 8 Then Jesus, knowing in his spirit that they are thinking like that, said to them, “Why are you thinking that to yourselves?
\v 9 Which is easier: to tell the paralysed man that his sins have been forgiven, or to tell him to pick up his bedding and walk?”
\v 10 But so you all can see that the son of man has authority on the earth to be forgiving sins, he turned and said to the paralysed man,
\v 11 “Listen. Get up, take your bedding, and go home!”
\v 12 So he stood up, and picked up his bedding, and went out of the house where everyone saw him and marvelled and praised God saying, “We’ve never seen anything like this happening before!”
\s1 The calling of Levi (Matthew)
\r (Mat. 9:9-13; Luk. 5:27-32)
\p
\v 13 Jesus went out beside the lake where crowds of people kept coming to him, and he taught them.
\v 14 And as he was passing by the tax office, he saw Levi Alphaeus sitting there and said to him, “Come along with me.” So Levi stood up and followed Jesus.
\p
\v 15 Jesus ended up having a meal at Levi’s place, and many other tax collectors and undesirables were sitting there also, along with Jesus’ followers, because by then many were following him around.
\v 16 And the teachers from the sect of the Pharisees noticed that Jesus was eating beside undesirables and tax collectors. So they asked his followers, “How come he eats with tax collectors and other low-life?” 
\v 17 And overhearing them, Jesus said, “Healthy people don’t need a doctor—it’s the sick ones that do. I didn’t come here to call those considered to have no needs, but to call sinners.”
\s1 The question of fasting
\r (Mat. 9:14-17; Luk. 5:33-39)
\p
\v 18 Now the followers of John the Immerser and members of the Pharisees regularly fasted. So a small group came to Jesus and asked, “How come John’s followers and the Pharisees fast regularly, yet your followers don’t?”
\v 19 And Jesus answered, “Can the friends of the groom fast when they’re celebrating along with him? No, as long as he’s still there, they won’t be fasting.
\v 20 But in the future, when the groom will be taken away from them, and \em then\em* they’ll be fasting.
\p
\v 21 “No one sews a patch of new, unshrunken cloth onto an old garment, because the new patch will tear away from that old fabric and it will end up as a worse tear.
\v 22 No one puts new wine into old wineskins, because the wine will burst the \add already stretched\add* wineskins, and both the wine and the wineskins will be destroyed. New wine must be put into \em new\em* wineskins.”
\s1 Working on the Rest Day
\r (Mat. 12:1-8; Luk. 6:1-5)
\p
\v 23 And it so happened that Jesus and his followers passed through some fields of grain on some days of rest. As they went through, they plucked off some heads of grain.
\v 24 And some members of the Pharisees said, “It’s breaking the law to do that on a rest day!”
\v 25 And Jesus replied, “You’ve read yourselves what David did when him and his men were hungry.
\v 26 They went into God’s tent and ate the holy bread representing the presence of God. Only the priests were allowed to eat that, and yet David even gave some to his men!”
\v 27 And he told the Pharisees, “The days of rest were created for people, not people for the rest days.
\v 28 So the son of man has authority also over the day of rest.”
