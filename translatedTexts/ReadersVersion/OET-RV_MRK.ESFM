\mt2 The account of Yeshua's ministry by
\mt1 Mark
\is1 Introduction
\is2 Author
\ip This account about the works and teachings of Yeshua was written by Mark, the son of a Jewish family who lived in Jerusalem. His mother was named Maria (Acts 12:12).
\ip Many people think he was John Mark, a cousin of Barnabas (Col. 4:10) who accompanied Paul on his first long-distance trip to spread the good news about Yeshua the messiah (Acts 12:25, 13:13). We also know that Mark accompanied Peter (1 Peter 5:13), and some consider that it might have been Peter who narrated to Mark what Yeshua had done and taught.
\is2 This account
\ip This account seems to have been written for non-Jews, especially perhaps those familiar with Roman customs. So he didn't use as much ink as Matthew or Luke explaining prophecies from the Jewish scriptures but he does however, take time to explain Jewish customs to help non-Jewish readers.
\ip Mark explains here that Yeshua came to serve both God and the people, and he often refers to him as ‘humankind's child’ (traditionally translated very literally from the Greek as the ‘Son of Man’). We can see that especially in 10:45: “Even humankind's child didn't come to be served, but to serve others and to give his life as a ransom to set many people free.” Mark wants his readers to know that Yeshua did incredible things, but especially focuses on his teaching. He confirms the power and authority of Yeshua by telling about the miracles that he did, his healing of the sick, and his exorcism of demons.
\ip The ending of this account is often disputed, and scholars are still \jmp debating|link-href="https://textandcanon.org/a-case-for-the-longer-ending-of-mark"\jmp* about whether or not the longer ending (16:9-20) is original. The \em OET\em* includes the disputed longer ending, but displays it in a lighter colour to indicate its debatable status.

\v 1 Here begins¦21751 the good¦21753 news about Yeshua¦21754 the messiah¦21756—the son of God¦21759:
\s1 The ministry of John the immerser (The return of ‘Elijah’)
\r (Mat. 3:1-12; Luk. 3:1-18; Jhn. 1:19-28)
\p
\v 2 \x + \xo 1:2: \xt Mal 3:1.\x*The prophet¦21771 Isaiah wrote:
\q1 “See, I am sending¦21774 my¦21778 messenger¦21777 to you,
\q1 the one who will be preparing¦21783 your¦21781 path¦21785.
\q1
\v 3 \x + \xo 1:3: \xt Isa 40:3 (LXX).\x*The voice¦21789 out in the wilderness¦21793 shouting¦21790,
\q2 ‘Get the path¦21796 ready for the master¦21797;
\q2 Make it smooth for him¦21803 to travel on.’ ”
\p
\v 4 John¦21880 turned up in the wilderness¦21885 announcing¦21888 that people should get immersed¦21882 in water in order to show that their sins¦21893 have been forgiven¦21892.
\v 5 And many from the Judean region¦21901 and from the city of Jerusalem went out to hear him, and they confessed¦21917 their¦21920 sins¦21919 and asked John to immerse¦21907 them in the Jordan¦21913 river¦21914.
\p
\v 6 \x + \xo 1:6: \xt 2Ki 1:8.\x*John¦21925 was dressed¦21926 in simple clothes made from camel¦21929 hair¦21927 with a leather¦21932 belt¦21931 around¦21933 his¦21936 waist¦21935, and he¦21934 lived on locusts¦21941 and wild honey¦21943.
\v 7 And he also announced¦21946, “There's a greater man coming¦21956 soon—in fact I'm not even good enough to bend¦21970 down and untie¦21971 his¦21978 sandals¦21976.
\v 8 I immersed¦21981 you in water¦21984, but he will immerse you all in God's pure¦21994 spirit¦21993.”
\s1 Yeshua gets immersed and then tempted
\r (Mat. 3:13–4:11; Luk. 3:21-22; 4:1-13)
\p
\v 9 \fig Yeshua was immersed by John.|src="41_Mk_01_06_RG.jpg" size="col" loc="1:9" copy="© Sweet Publishing" ref="1:9"\fig*Then one day Yeshua¦22006 came from Nazareth¦22008 in the Galilee¦22010 region, and he got immersed¦22012 in the Jordan¦22018 river by John¦22020.
\v 10 As Yeshua came up out of the water¦22029, he saw¦22030 the sky being¦22031 opened up, and God's spirit¦22037 coming¦22045 down on him like a dove¦22044.
\v 11 \x + \xo 1:11: \xt Gen 22:2; Psa 2:7; Isa 42:1; Mat 3:17; 12:18; Mrk 9:7; Luk 3:22.\x*And a voice¦22053 came¦22054 from the sky saying, “You are my¦22064 son who I love and am pleased¦22070 with.”
\p
\v 12 And then the spirit¦22076 sent him¦22079 into the wilderness¦22084
\v 13 where he was tested by Satan¦22098 for forty¦22092 days¦22093. He was out there with the wild animals, but messengers¦22106 waited on him there.
\s1 The selection of the first followers / apprentices
\r (Mat. 4:12-22; Luk. 4:14-15; 5:1-11)
\p
\v 14 After John¦22116 had been arrested, Yeshua¦22119 went back up to Galilee¦22122 announcing¦22123 the good¦22125 news from God¦22129
\v 15 \x + \xo 1:15: \xt Mat 3:2.\x*saying¦22131, “The promised time¦22137 is here, and God's kingdom¦22142 is now near. Turn from your sins and believe¦22149 this good¦22152 news.”
\p
\v 16 As he went around the lake of Galilee¦22161, Yeshua saw¦22162 two fishermen¦22184, Simon¦22164 and his brother¦22168 Andrew¦22166 throwing¦22172 a net¦22172 into the lake.
\v 17 And he said¦22186 to them, “Come with me and¦22193 I will make you¦22195 into fishermen¦22198 of people¦22199.”
\v 18 And so they¦22208 left their¦22205 fishing work and went off with Yeshua.
\p
\v 19 Then a bit further on he saw¦22216 two of Zebedee's¦22220 sons, Jacob¦22217 and his¦22225 brother¦22224 John¦22222, in a boat¦22230 getting their nets¦22233 ready.
\v 20 Yeshua called¦22237 them and they¦22256 too went¦22256 off with him¦22259, leaving their¦22244 father¦22243 Zebedee¦22245 in the boat¦22249 with the hired¦22252 workers.
\s1 Yeshua drives out a demon
\r (Luk. 4:31-37)
\p
\v 21 They went on into Capernaum¦22265 where he went into the meeting¦22278 hall¦22278 and began teaching¦22279 as soon as the rest day started.
\v 22 \x + \xo 1:22: \xt Mat 7:28-29.\x*The congregation was amazed¦22282 at his¦22286 teaching, because¦22288 he taught¦22285 with authority¦22292, not like the regular teachers¦22298 there.
\p
\v 23 Then a demon-possessed¦22311 man¦22308 in the meeting¦22305 hall¦22305 suddenly yelled¦22314 out,
\v 24 “What are we to you, Yeshua¦22322 of Nazareth¦22323? You've come to destroy¦22326 us. I know that you're¦22331 God's holy one.”
\p
\v 25 But Yeshua¦22342 scolded it, saying¦22344, “Keep quiet¦22346!”, and, “Come out of him!”
\p
\v 26 Then the demon¦22362 threw the man into a convulsion¦22357, cried out loudly¦22372, and left¦22375 him.
\v 27 Everyone was astounded¦22380 and asked each other, “What just happened? We haven't heard anything like this before—he has authority¦22408 to command¦22419 demons¦22418, and they obey¦22421 him!”
\p
\v 28 And the news¦22427 about Yeshua spread all over the entire¦22432 region¦22434 of Galilee¦22437.
\s1 Yeshua heals many others
\r (Mat. 8:14-17; Luk. 4:38-41)
\p
\v 29 After leaving the meeting¦22445 hall¦22445, Yeshua went into the home of Simon¦22454 and Andrew¦22456, along with Jacob¦22458 and John¦22460.
\v 30 Inside, Simon's mother-in-law¦22465 was lying¦22467 down with a fever¦22468, and the others spoke to Yeshua about¦22474 her.
\v 31 When he went up to her, and took hold of her hand¦22484 and helped her up, the fever¦22497 left her and she prepared something for them to eat.
\p
\v 32 That evening¦22504 when the sun¦22511 set, the people brought all those who were sick¦22518 or demon-possessed¦22524 to Yeshua.
\v 33 It seemed like the entire¦22527 town had gathered¦22531 there outside the front door¦22537.
\v 34 Yeshua healed¦22561 many who were sick¦22563 from a range¦22565 of diseases¦22566, and he commanded many demons to leave—not allowing¦22576 them to speak¦22580 because¦22581 they knew that he was the messiah¦22585.
\s1 Yeshua prays before going preaching
\r (Luk. 4:42-44)
\p
\v 35 In the small hours of the morning, Yeshua got¦22593 up¦22593 and went¦22596 out to a quiet¦22599 place¦22600 and prayed¦22604 there¦22601.
\v 36 But Simon¦22613 and the others came looking¦22608 for him,
\v 37 and when they found¦22620 him they said, “Everyone's looking¦22629 for¦22629 you!”
\p
\v 38 And Yeshua answered, “Well, we'll be going¦22637 into the other villages¦22645 around here, so that I can also tell them. That's what I came¦22662 here for.”
\v 39 \x + \xo 1:39: \xt Mat 4:23; 9:35.\x*Then he went preaching¦22667 in all their¦22675 meeting¦22673 halls¦22673 in Galilee¦22679 and driving¦22683 out demons¦22682.
\s1 Yeshua heals a man with leprosy
\r (Mat. 8:1-4; Luk. 5:12-16)
\p
\v 40 A man with leprosy came to Yeshua asking him, “I know that you could heal me if you wanted to.”
\p
\v 41 Yeshua felt compassion¦22711 for him, reached out his¦22716 hand¦22715 and touched¦22717 him, and said, “Yes, I will. Get well.”
\v 42 Then immediately¦22729 the leprosy¦22737 disappeared and he was well again.
\v 43 So Yeshua sent¦22746 him away, but warned him:
\v 44 \x + \xo 1:44: \xt Lev 14:1-32.\x*“Don't talk to anyone—just go to the priest¦22764 and show him¦22751 that you're well, and as a testimony¦22779 of that, make the offering¦22766 that Moses commanded¦22776.”
\p
\v 45 But after the man left, he started telling lots of people and spreading¦22789 the news—so much so that Yeshua could no longer¦22793 come into the town but had to stay out in quieter places¦22809, and people kept coming¦22812 to him.
\c 2
\s1 Yeshua heals a paralysed man
\r (Mat. 9:1-8; Luk. 5:17-26)
\p
\v 1 When Yeshua came back to Capernaum¦22824 after a few days¦22826, people soon heard¦22828 that he was back in the house¦22832.
\v 2 And so many people turned up there that there wasn't any room left—not even in the doorway. Inside, Yeshua was explaining the Scriptures to them.
\v 3 Four¦22870 men arrived, carrying¦22867 a paralysed¦22865 man to Yeshua,
\v 4 but because¦22878 of the crowd¦22882, they were unable to get close. So they climbed up onto the flat roof¦22886, made a hole through it¦22892, and lowered¦22893 the paralysed¦22904 man lying¦22905 on a pallet¦22895.
\v 5 Yeshua¦22911, observing their¦22914 faith¦22913, said to the man, “Son¦22919, your¦22924 sins¦22927 are forgiven¦22921!”
\p
\v 6 But some of the religious¦22933 teachers¦22933 were sitting¦22935 there¦22934, thinking¦22937 to themselves¦22940,
\v 7 “Why's he talking¦22947 like that? He's seriously insulting¦22949 God. There's only one who can forgive¦22952 sins¦22955, and that's God himself.”
\p
\v 8 Then Yeshua¦22966, knowing¦22964 in his¦22970 spirit¦22969 that they¦22975 are thinking like that, said to them, “Why are you¦22989 thinking that to yourselves¦22988?
\v 9 Which¦22990 is easier¦22993: to tell the paralysed¦22996 man that his sins¦23003 have been forgiven¦22999, or to tell him to pick up his bedding¦23013 and walk¦23017?”
\v 10 But¦23040 so you all can see that humankind's child \em does\em* have authority¦23034 here on the earth¦23045 to forgive¦23046 sins¦23047, he turned and said to the paralysed¦23050 man,
\v 11 “Listen. Get up, take¦23057 your¦23061 bedding¦23059, and¦23062 go home¦23066!”
\p
\v 12 So the man stood up, and picked up his bedding¦23082, and went out of the house where everyone saw¦23106 him and marvelled¦23090 and praised¦23096 God¦23098 saying¦23100, “We've¦23106 never¦23105 seen anything happen like this before¦23085!”
\s1 The calling of Levi (Matthew)
\r (Mat. 9:9-13; Luk. 5:27-32)
\p
\v 13 Yeshua went out beside¦23117 the lake¦23120 where crowds¦23124 of people kept coming¦23125 to him and he taught¦23130 them.
\v 14 And as he was passing¦23133 by the tax¦23145 office¦23145, he saw¦23134 Levi Alphaeus sitting¦23141 there and said to him, “Come along with me.” So Levi stood up and followed¦23154 Yeshua.
\p
\v 15 Yeshua ended up having a meal at Levi's place, and many other tax¦23173 collectors¦23173 and undesirables¦23175 were sitting¦23162 there also, along with Yeshua's¦23179 followers¦23182, because¦23185 by then many were following¦23189 him around.
\v 16 And the teachers¦23194 from the Pharisee¦23199 party¦23199 noticed that Yeshua was eating beside undesirables¦23212 and tax collectors. So they asked his¦23221 followers¦23220, “How come he eats with tax collectors and other low-life?”
\p
\v 17 And overhearing them, Yeshua¦23243 said, “Healthy people don't¦23247 need a doctor¦23252—it's the sick¦23255 ones that do. I didn't come here to help those who think they have no needs, but to call sinners¦23264.”
\s1 The question of fasting
\r (Mat. 9:14-17; Luk. 5:33-39)
\p
\v 18 Now the followers of John-the-Immerser and members of the Pharisees regularly fasted. So a small group came to Yeshua and asked, “How come John's followers and the Pharisee¦23277 party fast regularly, yet your followers don't¦23300?”
\p
\v 19 And Yeshua¦23306 answered, “Can the friends of the groom fast when they're celebrating along with him? No, as long as he's still there, they won't be fasting.
\v 20 But in the future, the groom will be taken¦23340 away from them, and¦23345 \em then\em* they'll be fasting¦23347.
\p
\v 21 “No one sews a patch of new, unshrunken¦23361 cloth¦23360 onto an old garment¦23366, because the new patch will tear away from that old fabric and it¦23378 will end up as a worse¦23387 tear.
\v 22 And no one puts new wine into old wineskins, because the wine will burst¦23410 the \add already stretched\add* wineskins, and then both the wine and the wineskins will be destroyed¦23424. New wine must be put into \em new\em* wineskins.”
\s1 Working on the Rest Day
\r (Mat. 12:1-8; Luk. 6:1-5)
\p
\v 23 \x + \xo 2:23: \xt Deu 23:25.\x*And it so happened that Yeshua and his¦23459 followers¦23458 passed through some fields¦23453 of grain on some days¦23445 of rest. As they went through, they plucked¦23464 off some heads¦23467 of grain.
\v 24 And some members of the Pharisee¦23471 party¦23471 said, “It's breaking the law to harvest grain on a rest day!”
\p
\v 25 And Yeshua replied, “You've read yourselves what David¦23503 did when him¦23514 and his men were hungry.
\v 26 \x + \xo 2:26: \xt Lev 24:9.\x*They went into God's tent and ate¦23535 the holy bread¦23531 representing the presence¦23533 of God. Only the priests¦23553 were allowed to eat¦23547 that, and yet David even gave¦23555 some to his men!”
\v 27 And he told the Pharisees, “The days of rest were created for people, not people for the rest days.
\v 28 So I, humankind's child, have authority also over the day¦23591 of rest.”
\c 3
\s1 The man with the curled-up hand
\r (Mat. 12:9-14; Luk. 6:6-11)
\p
\v 1 And again¦23596 another time, Yeshua went to the meeting¦23599 hall¦23599 and there was a man¦23605 there with a curled-up hand¦23613.
\v 2 The religious leaders there were watching¦23615 him closely¦23615 to see if he would heal the man on the rest day, and then if he did, they would have a case against¦23629 him.
\v 3 Then Yeshua said to the man¦23633 with the flawed hand¦23639, “Stand up there in the middle.”
\v 4 And he asked the leaders, “Is it allowable to do good¦23667 on the rest day, or only to do evil¦23671? To save¦23674 life¦23673, or to kill¦23678?” But they didn't reply.
\p
\v 5 After angrily looking around¦23683 at them, grieving¦23688 at their¦23695 complete lack of compassion, he said to the man, “Open up your¦23702 hand!”
\v 6 The man stretched out his fingers, and his hand became totally normal. But the Pharisees quickly left, and meeting with King Herod's¦23726 supporters¦23726, they conspired to kill¦23737 Yeshua.
\s1 Big crowds press on Yeshua
\p
\v 7 After that, Yeshua¦23741 withdrew¦23747 towards the lake¦23751 with his¦23746 followers¦23745, and a huge crowd¦23755 of people¦23755 from the regions of both Galilee¦23759 and down in Judea¦23766,
\v 8 along with others from Jerusalem¦23770, Idumea¦23774, from across the Jordan¦23779 River, and from up near Tyre¦23783 and Sidon¦23787. They came¦23798 because they had heard about the amazing things he had done.
\v 9 \x + \xo 3:9-10: \xt Mrk 4:1; Luk 5:1-3.\x*So Yeshua asked his¦23806 apprentices¦23805 to organise a small¦23808 boat¦23808 to be there for him so he wouldn't be cramped by the press of the crowd¦23814.
\v 10 Virtually anyone who had any physical issues was pressing¦23825 towards him to touch¦23832 him, because he¦23822 had already healed¦23822 so many.
\v 11 And the demons¦23843, whenever¦23844 they saw Yeshua, they fell down to the ground in front of him and yelled out, “You are God's son!”
\v 12 But he regularly warned them not to reveal who he was.
\s1 Yeshua appoints his twelve representatives
\r (Mat. 10:1-4; Luk. 6:12-16)
\p
\v 13 As Yeshua started climbing up a hill, he called the followers that he had selected, and they went¦23899 off with him.
\v 14 He appointed twelve¦23906 of them as his representatives so that they¦23914 could stick with him¦23917 and¦23922 be sent off to be proclaiming¦23927 his message
\v 15 and¦23930 to also have authority¦23934 to exorcise demons¦23941.
\p
\v 16 These are the twelve¦23950 that he appointed: Simon¦23955 (but he appended the name¦23953 “Peter”),
\v 17 Jacob¦23971 and his brother¦23968 John¦23966 who were Zebedee's¦23963 sons (and he nicknamed them the “sons of thunder¦23985”),
\v 18 Andrew¦23991, Philip, Bartholomew¦23999, Matthew¦24001, Thomas, Jacob¦24007 Alphaeus, Thaddeus¦24014, Simon¦24017 from Canaan,
\v 19 and¦24025 Judas Iscariot who later betrayed him¦24037.
\s1 The two opposing spiritual powers
\r (Mat. 12:22-32; Luk. 11:14-23; 12:10)
\p
\v 20 Then Yeshua was approaching a house¦24043, but the crowd¦24048 swarmed them again¦24046 so they had no opportunity to eat¦24057.
\v 21 The ones with him heard¦24060 all the noise and came¦24071 to get him, because¦24076 they were wondering if he¦24062 was crazy.
\p
\v 22 \x + \xo 3:22: \xt Mat 9:34; 10:25.\x*The religious¦24085 teachers¦24085 had come¦24089 up from Jerusalem¦24088 and were complaining, “He's possessed by the prince of demons. He can command them because he rules them!”
\p
\v 23 But Yeshua addressed them: “How could Satan¦24125 command himself?
\v 24 If a kingdom is divided¦24134 against¦24132 itself¦24133, that kingdom could never prosper.
\v 25 If a household is divided¦24147 against¦24145 itself¦24146, that family will never prosper.
\v 26 So if Satan¦24162 attacked himself¦24168 and was split, he¦24175 couldn't possibly be powerful, but his time would be over.
\p
\v 27 On the contrary, no one can enter the house of a strong man to clean out his¦24204 possessions unless he first¦24208 ties up that strong man—after that he can work on the goods¦24203.
\p
\v 28 Honestly, I assure you¦24223 that any sin of a person can be forgiven¦24226, no matter how much they¦24244 curse God.
\v 29 \x + \xo 3:29: \xt Luk 12:10.\x*But whoever¦24245 speaks against¦24251 the Holy Spirit can never be forgiven¦24258, but¦24262 is eternally¦24261 responsible for their sin¦24269.”
\v 30 (He said this because¦24271 they¦24272 were saying¦24272 that he was demon-possessed¦24274.)
\s1 Yeshua's mother and brothers arrive
\r (Mat. 12:46-50; Luk. 8:19-21)
\p
\v 31 Now Yeshua's mother¦24289 and brothers¦24293 came and were standing¦24297 outside¦24296 and asked someone to tell him that they were there.
\v 32 Some in the crowd¦24314 sitting¦24308 around¦24310 him told Yeshua that his mother¦24323 and brothers¦24327 were waiting outside¦24333 for him.
\p
\v 33 But Yeshua answered¦24342, “Who is my mother¦24352 and¦24354 who are my brothers¦24357?”
\v 34 And having¦24360 looked¦24360 around at the people sitting¦24367 here, he said, “Actually, you all are my mother¦24375 and my brothers¦24379.
\v 35 For whoever¦24382 obeys God¦24392, that person is my brother¦24395 and my sister¦24398 and my mother¦24401.”

\s1 The parable about planting seed
\r (Mat. 13:1-9; Luk. 8:4-8)
\p
\v 1 \x + \xo 4:1: \xt Luk 5:1-3.\x*Again Yeshua started teaching¦24407 by the edge of the lake¦24411. A huge crowd gathered¦24413 around him, but he had boarded¦24429 the boat¦24428 floating in the water, and all the people were there on the land.
\v 2 And he taught¦24459 them many different things¦24464 in parables¦24463, including this one:
\v 3 “Listen. Once there was a farmer who went to spread some seed.
\v 4 As he spread it, some landed on the path, and the birds¦24500 came and feed on it.
\v 5 Some landed on a rocky¦24515 part without a lot of soil, and it¦24521 quickly sprouted in the warm, shallow soil,
\v 6 but when the sun¦24546 came up, it dried out because¦24550 the roots weren't deep, and so it just withered¦24555 up.
\v 7 Some of the seed landed in a thistle patch, and the thistles grew and choked¦24571 it out, so the plants never bore a crop.
\v 8 But some seed landing in fertile soil and it bore a harvest—some of it multiplying thirty¦24605 times, some sixty¦24611, and some a hundred¦24617 times.”
\p
\v 9 Then Yeshua added, “Whoever wants to understand, let them consider it.”
\s1 Why Yeshua speaks in parables
\r (Mat. 13:10-17; Luk. 8:9-10)
\p
\v 10 And when the crowd had left, the twelve¦24653 apprentices asked him about¦24648 the parables¦24659.
\v 11 And he told them, “You've been given¦24671 understanding about God's kingdom¦24673, but for others, they'll get it in parables¦24682
\q1
\v 12 \x + \xo 4:12: \xt Isa 6:9-10 (LXX).\x*so that when they look they might see but not perceive¦24693,
\q1 and when they listen, they might hear¦24695 but not understand¦24700,
\q1 otherwise they might turn¦24703 \add from their sins\add* and be forgiven¦24705.”
\s1 Explaining about the ground where the seed fell
\r (Mat. 13:18-23; Luk. 8:11-15)
\p
\v 13 Then Yeshua said to them, “If you didn't understand this parable¦24717, how will you understand any others?
\v 14 The one spreading seed is spreading the Good News.
\v 15 And there are some along¦24737 the path where¦24741 the Good News is being¦24742 spread, who hear, but Satan¦24754 turns up immediately¦24750 and snatches the message from them.
\v 16 And similarly, there's some the falls onto rocky¦24782 places¦24782 where the people who hear¦24788 the Good News happily accept it¦24796,
\v 17 but don't¦24798 make strong roots, just temporary¦24804 \add changes\add*. So when they get mocked or attacked about accepting the Good News, they quickly stumble¦24818.
\v 18 Others are the ones where the seed was spread among¦24827 the thistles. They heard¦24839 the Good News,
\v 19 but contemporary topics, or the lure of money, or the appetite for other¦24863 things¦24863 choke their good intentions and the message¦24868 becomes¦24872 unfruitful¦24870 in them.
\v 20 But lastly, the seed that landed on the good¦24885 soil represents the people who hear¦24890 the Good News, accept¦24894 it and are fruitful¦24896 thirty¦24901, sixty¦24905, or even a hundred¦24909 times over.”
\s1 The light will shine on everything
\r (Luk. 8:16-18)
\p
\v 21 \x + \xo 4:21: \xt Mat 5:15; Luk 11:33.\x*And Yeshua told them, “Obviously no one goes and gets a lamp, and then puts it under a basket¦24925 or under the bed, but rather places it somewhere higher on a stand.
\v 22 \x + \xo 4:22: \xt Mat 10:26; Luk 12:2.\x*You see, nothing is hidden¦24948 that won't eventually be disclosed, and¦24955 there's¦24946 no secret¦24957 that won't eventually be revealed¦24954.
\v 23 Anyone who wants to understand, let them listen carefully.”
\p
\v 24 \x + \xo 4:24: \xt Mat 7:2; Luk 6:38.\x*And he¦24972 continued, “Take care what you listen to. Because how much you judge others, so too will judgement be handed out to you, and even more.
\v 25 \x + \xo 4:25: \xt Mat 13:12; 25:29; Luk 19:26.\x*Whoever has \add faith\add* will be given¦24995 \add a reward\add*, but if you have none, even the little you have will be taken¦25005 away.”
\s1 The parable concerning the seed
\p
\v 26 And then, “God's kingdom¦25014 is like a person throwing¦25022 some seed onto the ground.
\v 27 Whether the person sleeps¦25033 at night or stays up night and day¦25041, the seed will sprout¦25045 and grow either way, and they don't¦25051 know how it does it.
\v 28 The earth¦25058 is \add designed\add* to multiply the seed: first¦25060 a sprout appears, then a bigger plant, and then the full head of grain.
\v 29 \x + \xo 4:29: \xt Joel 3:13.\x*And when it's ripe, then the harvester is sent in because¦25089 it's ready for harvest¦25092.”
\s1 The small seed produces a large result
\r (Mat. 13:31-32,34; Luk. 13:18-19)
\p
\v 30 Again he said, “What could we like God's kingdom¦25101 to? Or what parable¦25110 could we explain it with?
\v 31 It's like planting a mustard¦25121 seed in the ground—a very small¦25136 seed.
\v 32 But when it's planted¦25164 and grows up, it forms a large bush with many branches¦25170 so that birds¦25180 can rest in its shade.”
\p
\v 33 And so as much as they¦25195 could handle it, Yeshua shared the Good News with them via many similar word pictures.
\v 34 He never spoke without¦25199 these illustrations, but he explained¦25212 all of them to his close followers¦25210.
\s1 Yeshua halts the storm on the lake
\r (Mat. 8:23-27; Luk. 8:22-25)
\p
\v 35 It was already becoming¦25223 evening¦25222 on that day¦25221, so Yeshua said \add to his apprentices\add*, “Let's all go across¦25227 to the other shore.”
\v 36 So they left the crowd¦25233 behind and got into the boat¦25241 with him.
\v 37 \add Out in the lake\add* a big storm¦25259 came up with strong winds, and the waves¦25269 started breaking¦25272 across the boat and filling it.
\v 38 But Yeshua slept on in the back, sleeping¦25295 on a cushion¦25293. They woke him and cried, “Teacher¦25304, don't¦25305 you care that we're all about to drown?”
\p
\v 39 Now awake, Yeshua scolded the wind and waves, “Quieten down! Stop that!” Then the wind died¦25327 down and the water became¦25331 very calm.
\v 40 And \add turning back to them\add* he¦25335 asked, “Why were you all so afraid? Don't you have any faith¦25347 yet?”
\p
\v 41 But now they were very afraid¦25349 \add again\add* and asked each other, “Who could this man be that both the wind¦25365 and waves obey¦25375 him¦25374?”
\c 5
\s1 Yeshua send the demons into the pigs
\r (Mat. 8:28-34; Luk. 8:26-39)
\p
\v 1 So they¦25377 got \add safely\add* to the region¦25390 of Gerasenes¦25392 on the other side of the lake¦25385.
\v 2 As Yeshua climbed out of the boat¦25404, a demon-possessed¦25417 man¦25414 came out of the tombs¦25413 to meet him.
\v 3 He lived in those tombs¦25426, and¦25427 no one could tie him¦25438 up, not even with chains¦25430,
\v 4 because¦25442 he had often¦25445 been tied up in the past with shackles and chains but had always pulled the chains apart¦25458 and smashed the shackles, and no one was able to subdue him.
\v 5 All through¦25484 the day¦25489 and night¦25486, whether in the tombs¦25494 or up in the hills, he was yelling out and hurting himself¦25507 with stones¦25509.
\p
\v 6 So when he had seen¦25511 Yeshua¦25514 in the distance, he ran¦25517 and \add as a sign of honour\add* fell to the ground in front of him.
\v 7 Then he called out very loudly¦25526, “What will happen between us, Yeshua¦25534, the son of the highest¦25539 God? I beg you in God's name not to torment¦25547 me.”
\v 8 Because¦25550 Yeshua had already started saying¦25549, “Come out of the man¦25563 you¦25555 ungodly spirit¦25556!”
\p
\v 9 Yeshua asked, “What's¦25568 your¦25571 name?”
\p The man answered, “My name is ‘Thousands’ because¦25586 there's many of us,”
\v 10 and he begged Yeshua not to send¦25599 them out of the country¦25604.
\p
\v 11 It just so happened that there¦25607 was a large herd of pigs being¦25619 fed on the hill nearby
\v 12 and¦25624 they¦25625 begged Yeshua again saying¦25635, “Send us to the pigs so that we¦25646 can enter them.”
\v 13 Yeshua agreed to that, so the ungodly spirits¦25663 came out of the man, went into the pigs, and the entire herd of some two thousand¦25685 pigs rushed¦25673 down the steep¦25678 bank into the sea and were drowned¦25687.
\p
\v 14 The ones who had been feeding¦25694 them rushed off and spread the news around in the city¦25707 and the surrounding area. So the people hurried out to see¦25715 what had happened.
\v 15 When they arrived where Yeshua¦25725 was, they saw the man who had been demon-possessed¦25731 fully-clothed and sitting¦25732 there in full control of his senses. They knew it was the man called ‘Thousands’ and they became frightened.
\v 16 Those who had seen¦25749 it all happen described¦25745 it all to the people—what had happened both to the demon-possessed¦25755 man and to the pigs.
\p
\v 17 So then the people began¦25761 asking Yeshua to go¦25766 away from their¦25771 region¦25770.
\p
\v 18 As Yeshua was climbing back into the boat¦25778, the man who had been demon-possessed¦25784 wanted to go with him.
\p
\v 19 But Yeshua wouldn't let him and told him to head back home¦25806 to his own people¦25810, and explain to them what the Master¦25820 had done for him and how he had been merciful to him.
\p
\v 20 So he went¦25831 away and shared with the people of the Ten Cities region what Yeshua¦25844 had done for him, and they were all amazed¦25847.
\s1 A woman is healed as Yeshua goes to help a dying girl
\r (Mat. 9:18-26; Luk. 8:40-56)
\p
\v 21 When Yeshua¦25852 had crossed¦25849 in the boat¦25855 to the other side of the lake, a large crowd¦25865 of people came out to the lake edge to see him¦25869.
\v 22 A religious leader¦25881 named Jairus came out, and when he found Yeshua he fell down at his¦25895 feet¦25894
\v 23 and pleaded, “My¦25907 young daughter¦25906 is critical and just hanging on for you¦25914 to come¦25911 and touch her¦25924 so that she¦25927 can be healed¦25927 and live¦25929.”
\p
\v 24 So Yeshua went¦25933 off with Jairus. The large crowd¦25940 followed¦25937 also and¦25942 many were getting pressed¦25943 against Yeshua.
\p
\v 25 Then a woman¦25946 came who had been losing blood¦25951 for twelve¦25953 years¦25954
\v 26 and who had endured much under¦25959 various doctors¦25961 despite spending everything she had. After all that, she'd ended up even worse¦25977,
\v 27 but when she heard¦25980 about what Yeshua had been doing, she worked her way through the crowd¦25988 to the back of Yeshua and touched¦25992 his¦25995 clothes,
\v 28 because she¦25999 had told herself, “If I could even just touch¦26006 his¦26014 clothes, I would be healed¦26016.”
\p
\v 29 And immediately¦26018 the bleeding stopped and she knew¦26027 that she had been healed¦26031.
\v 30 Immediately also, Yeshua¦26042 knew that power¦26049 had gone out of him, and he turned¦26054 back towards the crowd¦26057 and said, “Who touched¦26062 my¦26061 clothes¦26064?”
\p
\v 31 But his¦26072 followers¦26071 said, “You can see all the people that were pressing¦26078 on you so why would you ask who touched¦26085 you?”
\p
\v 32 But Yeshua was still looking¦26087 around¦26087 to see¦26088 who had done it.
\v 33 And the woman¦26096, scared and shaking because of what was happening, came¦26109 and fell down in front of Yeshua and told him the whole story.
\v 34 Yeshua said¦26128, “Daughter¦26131, your¦26135 faith¦26134 has healed¦26136 you. Go in peace¦26140 and full health¦26143.”
\p
\v 35 While he was still¦26163 speaking¦26150, messengers came from Jairus' house to tell him, “Your¦26160 daughter¦26159 has died¦26161. Why bother the teacher¦26166 any more?”
\p
\v 36 But Yeshua¦26169 overheard¦26171 them telling this to the leader¦26180 and told him, “Don't be afraid—keep believing¦26184.”
\v 37 And Yeshua didn't allow¦26187 anyone to accompany¦26198 him¦26193 other than Peter, and Jacob¦26210 and his brother¦26209, John¦26207.
\v 38 As they¦26213 approached Jairus' house¦26218, Yeshua saw a big commotion¦26225 with lots of crying and yelling going on.
\v 39 As he entered, he said, “Why are you all crying in distress¦26239? The child¦26244 hasn't died¦26246—she's just sleeping¦26248!”
\p
\v 40 But they just ridiculed¦26252 Yeshua. So he sent them all outside, just taking¦26266 the father¦26268 and mother¦26276 of the child, along with three with him. He went in where¦26287 the girl was
\v 41 and taking her hand¦26297, he said, “Young woman, I tell you: get up!”
\v 42 Immediately she got up and walked around. And everyone marvelled¦26333 at the amazing thing that had happened. (She was twelve¦26331 years¦26330 old.)
\v 43 Yeshua repeatedly told them to keep this to themselves, and¦26347 added that they should give her¦26351 something¦26351 to eat¦26352.
\c 6
\s1 Yeshua's community can't believe he's from God
\r (Mat. 13:53-58; Luk. 4:16-30)
\p
\v 1 So Yeshua left¦26354 there¦26355 and went back with his followers¦26367 to his hometown¦26361.
\v 2 It was now the Rest Day and when he started teaching¦26376 in the meeting¦26379 hall¦26379, many who heard him were astonished¦26386, saying¦26391, “Where did he learn all this? How could he have such wisdom¦26400 and be able to do these¦26394 miracles¦26409?
\v 3 Isn't this the carpenter¦26423, the son of Maria¦26428, and the brother¦26431 of Jacob¦26433 and Joseph and Judas and Simon¦26441? Don't his sisters¦26448 live around here?” And they¦26455 were offended¦26455 by his teaching.
\p
\v 4 \x + \xo 6:4: \xt Jn 4:44.\x*Yeshua¦26463 told them, “A¦26467 prophet¦26467 is only dishonouring¦26468 in his own home town¦26474, and among¦26478 his own relatives¦26481, and in his own home.”
\p
\v 5 And he wasn't able to do even one miracle¦26497 there¦26492, except¦26499 for placing his hands¦26505 on a few sick¦26502 people and healing them.
\v 6 He was amazed at how they wouldn't believe him as he went around the villages¦26520 teaching¦26523.
\s1 Yeshua sends his apprentices out in pairs
\r (Mat. 10:5-15; Luk. 9:1-6)
\p
\v 7 Then he called his twelve¦26528 apprentices and started sending¦26533 them out in pairs and giving¦26540 them authority¦26544 over demons¦26548.
\v 8 He insisted that they¦26555 can carry a walking stick but not to take food, a backpack, or money¦26577.
\v 9 They could wear one pair of sandals¦26580, but¦26578 not take changes of clothes.
\v 10 And he¦26589 told them, “Whenever you are invited into a home, stay at that one place until¦26602 you leave that town.
\v 11 \x + \xo 6:11: \xt Acts 13:51.\x*But if any places don't want you or don't want to hear¦26617 what you have to say, just leave that place¦26611. As you go, shake¦26622 the dust off your¦26629 sandals so they can see \add that you pass the responsibility of what happened to them\add*.
\p
\v 12 So the apprentices went off and started telling people to repent¦26655.
\v 13 \x + \xo 6:13: \xt Jam 5:14.\x*And they drove out many demons¦26658, and anointed¦26664 many sick¦26669 people with olive¦26666 oil and healed them.
\s1 The execution of John-the-Immerser
\r (Mat. 14:1-12; Luk. 9:7-9)
\p
\v 14 \x + \xo 6:14-15: \xt Mat 16:14; Mrk 8:28; Luk 9:19.\x*Yeshua was now becoming well known and King Herod¦26678 \add Antipas\add* heard¦26674 about him. He thought that maybe John-the-Immerser had come back to life and that's why he was able to do miracles¦26705.
\p
\v 15 But others thought it was \add the promised return of\add* Elijah, and¦26716 yet others thought he¦26724 must be another prophet¦26719 like the ones \add in the Scriptures\add*.
\p
\v 16 But hearing about Yeshua, Herod¦26729 was telling people, “That John¦26737 who I had beheaded¦26736, he must have come back to life!”
\v 17 \x + \xo 6:17-18: \xt Luk 3:19-20.\x*Because¦26751 Herod¦26753 himself¦26749 had had John¦26757 arrested and put in prison¦26768 because he had married¦26781 Herodias, his¦26777 brother¦26776 Philip's wife¦26773.
\v 18 John¦26786 had been telling him that it was wrong for him to marry his brother's¦26800 wife¦26797,
\v 19 and so Herodias resented¦26806 him enough to want to kill¦26813 him, but Herod hadn't be able to
\v 20 because¦26820 he respected John as a righteous¦26828 and holy teacher and so he kept him alive. He often enjoyed hearing¦26845 from John and thought a lot about what he said.
\p
\v 21 However, an opportunity¦26850 came at Herod's¦26852 birthday¦26855 celebration¦26855, when he threw a feast for his¦26856 top officials and generals and for the leaders¦26868 in Galilee¦26870.
\v 22 The daughter¦26876 of Herodias came in and danced¦26882 for them, and the king and his party guests all enjoyed it. So the king said to the young woman, “Just ask me for anything and I'll give it to you.”
\v 23 And he made an oath, “Even if you asked for half of my¦26934 kingdom¦26933, I'd give it to you!”
\p
\v 24 So she went out and asked her mother what she should ask for. Her¦26942 mother told her that she should ask for John's head.
\p
\v 25 So going back into the party, she¦26967 said seriously to the king¦26966, “I would like the head of John-the-Immerser on a plate!”
\p
\v 26 The king¦26991 was really upset with that, but because¦26994 he had made loud oaths¦26996 in front of all his guests, he couldn't say no.
\v 27 So he ordered an executioner¦27014 to go out and return with John's head. He went off and beheaded¦27028 him in the prison¦27032
\v 28 and brought¦27034 the head into the party on a plate and gave it to the girl, and she gave it to her¦27053 mother¦27052.
\v 29 When John's followers¦27058 heard¦27055 about this, they came¦27060 and fetched his¦27059 body and put it into a tomb¦27074.
\s1 Yeshua feeds 5,000 people
\r (Mat. 14:13-21; Luk. 9:10-17; Jn 6:1-14)
\p
\v 30 Now the apprentices who had been sent out returned back to Yeshua¦27081 and they reported¦27083 back everything they had done and what they had been teaching \add people\add*.
\v 31 Then he told them, “Let's just all of us head for a quiet¦27108 place¦27109 and take a break.” This was because there were so many people always coming¦27119 and going¦27122, and sometimes they didn't even have a chance to eat¦27126.
\v 32 So they¦27133 went¦27133 by boat¦27138 away to a quiet¦27142 place¦27143 by themselves¦27147.
\p
\v 33 But people from towns all around had seen them going¦27153 and recognised¦27159 who they were, so they ran¦27172 around the lake on foot¦27164 and got there¦27173 ahead¦27175 of them.
\v 34 \x + \xo 6:34: \xt Num 27:17; 1Ki 22:17; 2Ch 18:16; Eze 34:5; Mat 9:36.\x*So when Yeshua got out of the boat, he saw¦27188 a big crowd¦27193 and felt sorry for them because¦27202 they seemed like sheep¦27205 without a shepherd¦27208, so he started teaching¦27212 them many things¦27215.
\v 35 Then, when it was already getting late, his¦27227 apprentices¦27226 came up and said, “This place¦27236 is pretty isolated and it's already late.
\v 36 Send these people off now so they can go to the nearby settlements and villages¦27254 and buy themselves¦27257 something¦27260 to eat¦27262.”
\p
\v 37 But Yeshua answered¦27269 them, “You give them something to eat.”
\p They complained, “If we go, should we buy several months wages worth of bread so we can give all of them something to eat?”
\p
\v 38 But he¦27301 asked, “Go and find out how much bread you¦27310 have.”
\p When they'd found out they said, “Five buns and two¦27323 fish.”
\p
\v 39 Yeshua told all the people to line up in rows and sit¦27330 down on the green¦27341 grass¦27342.
\v 40 So they sat¦27345 down in rows of fifty¦27355 to a hundred¦27351.
\v 41 Then holding the five buns and two fish, he looking up to the sky¦27368 and blessed¦27369 \add God\add*, and then broke¦27373 up the buns and gave pieces to his¦27381 apprentices¦27380 so they could do likewise to the people, and he also divided¦27392 up the two fish,
\v 42 and all the people ate¦27395 and were satisfied¦27398.
\v 43 Then they¦27400 collected the left-over pieces of bread, filling¦27406 twelve¦27403 baskets¦27405, as well as the left-over pieces of fish.
\v 44 And the headcount of men¦27423 who ate that evening was five¦27421 thousand¦27421.
\s1 Yeshua walks on the lake surface
\r (Mat. 14:22-33; Jn 6:15-21)
\p
\v 45 Straight after that, Yeshua sent his¦27431 apprentices¦27430 off in the boat¦27435 to go across¦27442 to Bethsaida while he sent the crowd¦27452 home.
\v 46 Then he said goodbye¦27454 to everyone, and climbed the hill to pray.
\v 47 Later in the night, the boat¦27467 was out in the middle of the lake¦27473, and only Yeshua remained back there on the land.
\v 48 He saw them struggling to row against the wind¦27496, and sometime after 3am he came out to them, walking¦27511 on the lake¦27516 surface as if to walk¦27511 past them.
\v 49 But they had seen¦27525 someone walking¦27531 on the lake¦27530 and thought it was a ghost¦27534, and they yelled¦27539 out
\v 50 because they had all seen it and were terrified.
\p But Yeshua immediately¦27550 spoke¦27552 to them and said, “Hey, take heart, it's me, don't¦27564 be afraid!”
\v 51 Then he climbed up into the boat¦27574 and the wind¦27580 died¦27578 down. And they were all totally astounded
\v 52 because they¦27593 hadn't understood¦27593 the implications of him feeding all the people because their¦27600 minds were closed.
\s1 Yeshua heals many people around Gennesaret
\r (Mat. 14:34-36)
\p
\v 53 After completing their crossing¦27606, they¦27613 anchored¦27618 at Gennesaret.
\v 54 And when they got out of the boat¦27624, again people recognised¦27627 Yeshua
\v 55 and ran¦27636 around¦27636 that region, so next minute people began¦27645 bringing all of those who were sick¦27654, carrying¦27656 them on pallets¦27649 to wherever¦27660 they heard that Yeshua was.
\v 56 And whenever Yeshua entered¦27679 villages¦27682 or cities¦27685 or fields¦27688 or marketplaces¦27697, they laid the sick down there and were imploring¦27703 him that they might even just touch¦27712 the edge of his¦27711 robe, and anyone who did so was healed¦27720.
\c 7
\s1 Yeshua suggests obeying God, not tradition
\r (Mat. 15:1-9)
\p
\v 1 Some from the Pharisee¦27726 party¦27726 and¦27727 some of the law teachers¦27730 had come¦27731 from Jerusalem¦27733 to observe Yeshua
\v 2 and¦27734 noticed that some of his¦27741 followers¦27740 were eating¦27750 their food without following their religious customs, i.e., without washing their hands¦27745.
\v 3 (The Pharisees and¦27759, in fact, all the Jewish religious leaders do not eat without first ceremonially washing their hands¦27769 as taught by their elders¦27779 over the generations.
\v 4 They won't eat at the market¦27782 if they can't do this first, and have many other¦27793 regulations about ceremonial washing¦27803 of cups and jugs and copper¦27808 kettles¦27808.)
\p
\v 5 And the Pharisees and¦27818 religious¦27820 teachers¦27820 asked Yeshua, “How come your¦27828 followers¦27827 don't¦27829 follow our Jewish traditions¦27833, but¦27836 eat without the ceremonial washing of hands¦27842?”
\p
\v 6 \x + \xo 7:6-7: \xt Isa 29:13 (LXX).\x*And he answered¦27848, “Isaiah got it exactly right¦27852 when he expressed God's thoughts about you hypocrites¦27860 and wrote:
\q1 ‘These people¦27868 honour¦27874 me with their lips¦27871,
\q2 but their real desires are far away from mine.
\q1
\v 7 Their worship¦27887 of me is worthless,
\q2 teaching¦27889 man-made rules as if they¦27887 are from God.’
\p
\v 8 You've ignored God's commands¦27908 instead accepting human¦27916 traditions¦27914.
\p
\v 9 And Yeshua continued, “You all simply dismiss God's commands¦27934 in favour of your¦27940 own customs.
\v 10 \x + \xo 7:10: a \xt Exo 20:12; Deu 5:16; \xo b \xt Exo 21:17; Lev 20:9.\x*Moses teaches us,
\q1 ‘Honour your¦27950 parents,’
\p and
\q1 ‘Anyone dishonestly slandering their parents deserves the death¦27962 penalty.’
\m
\v 11 But when you all encourage people to say¦27971, ‘Whatever I had that may have helped you guys has been given to God’,
\v 12 you¦27993 are actively discouraging them from helping their parents—
\v 13 overriding God's voice for your¦28014 very convenient teaching that you disseminate instead. And that's not the only example!”
\s1 Evil comes from inside a person
\r (Mat. 15:10-20)
\p
\v 14 Yeshua called¦28029 out to the crowd¦28033, “Everyone listen to me carefully:
\v 15 Nothing that enters¦28051 your mouth makes you guilty in God's eyes. It's what comes \em out\em* of you that demonstrates your culpability.”
\p
\v 16 ≈
\v 17 When Yeshua came¦28085 back inside, his¦28099 apprentices¦28098 asked him what he meant.
\v 18 But he scolded them, “Can't you understand¦28115 something so simple! Can't you see that anything from the outside¦28120 that enters¦28121 your body doesn't make you guilty in God's sight,
\v 19 because¦28131 it doesn't enter¦28135 your mind¦28140 but merely goes into your stomach and ends up in the toilet.” (By saying this he clearly showed that is was ok for Jews to eat any food.)
\p
\v 20 He continued, “It's what comes out of you that makes you guilty in God's eyes.
\v 21-22 That's because evil¦28185 thoughts, sexual¦28188 immorality¦28188, theft¦28190, murder¦28193, adultery¦28195, greed, wickedness, deceit, arrogance, lust, slander, pride, and foolishness all come from \em inside¦28175\em* people's¦28181 hearts¦28179 \add and minds\add*.
\v 23 So it's the evil¦28214 that's inside¦28215 a person¦28222 and¦28218 comes out that makes them guilty in God's eyes.”
\s1 The bold faith of a non-Jewish woman
\r (Mat. 15:21-28)
\p
\v 24 Yeshua left that place and went¦28228 \add up north\add* into the regions¦28231 of Tyre¦28233 and Sidon¦28235. He tried to enter a house¦28240 without being noticed¦28250 but didn't succeed,
\v 25 and straight away a woman¦28259 who had heard¦28257 about¦28260 him turned up. She knelt in front of him because she had a little¦28265 daughter¦28265 who was demon-possessed¦28271.
\v 26 The woman¦28285 was Greek from Phoenicia in Syria and¦28295 she¦28296 begged Yeshua to command the demon¦28300 to leave her¦28307 daughter¦28306.
\v 27 But he replied, “Let the \add Jewish\add* children be treated first¦28317, because¦28322 it's not good to take the children's food and throw¦28335 it to the dogs.”
\p
\v 28 And she responded, “Yes, master¦28344, but the puppies under the table¦28355 \em do\em* get to eat the little crumbs¦28361 that the children¦28364 drop.”
\p
\v 29 And he answered, “Go home now. As a result of how you just spoke, the demon¦28376 has already left your¦28380 daughter¦28379.”
\p
\v 30 And when she¦28390 got home¦28387, the demon¦28409 had indeed gone and her little¦28397 girl was lying quietly on her bed.
\s1 Yeshua heals a deaf man who couldn't speak
\p
\v 31 Yeshua left the Tyre¦28417 region, passed through¦28419 Sidon¦28421, and came¦28418 down the \add eastern\add* side of the Lake of Galilee¦28428 to the Decapolis region.
\v 32 The people there brought a man¦28443 to him who couldn't hear or speak, and asked Yeshua to heal him.
\v 33 So Yeshua took the man back away from the crowd¦28463, put his¦28472 fingers¦28471 in the man's ears¦28476, then he spat and touched¦28481 the man's mouth.
\v 34 Looking up to the sky¦28490, he sighed and said, “Open up!”
\p
\v 35 Then the man could hear, and his¦28505 tongue¦28517 was released¦28513 and he began to speak¦28520 properly.
\v 36 The Yeshua advised that they shouldn't tell anyone, but the more he¦28523 said that, the more they seemed to spread it¦28541 around.
\v 37 The crowds were totally amazed¦28545, saying¦28546, “He can do anything—he makes the deaf able to hear¦28556, and enables the ones who couldn't speak¦28560.”
\c 8
\s1 Yeshua feeds 4,000 people
\r (Mat. 15:32-39)
\p
\v 1 Another time there was a large crowd¦28569 again¦28567 with nothing to eat. Yeshua called¦28577 his¦28582 apprentices¦28581 and told them,
\v 2 “I feel sorry for all these people because¦28594 they've already¦28595 been with us for three¦28599 days¦28596 and¦28608 don't¦28609 have anything¦28611 to eat¦28612.
\v 3 I can't send them home¦28621 because they're too weak to walk, and some have a long way to go.”
\p
\v 4 His¦28647 apprentices¦28646 queried, “Where could anyone¦28658 find enough food out here in the wilderness¦28664?”
\p
\v 5 He asked, “How much bread have you¦28676 all got?”
\p “Seven¦28683 buns,” they¦28679 answered.
\p
\v 6 So Yeshua instructed the crowd to sit down on the ground¦28692. Then he took the seven¦28696 buns, gave thanks¦28699 and broke¦28700 them and gave pieces to his¦28706 apprentices¦28705 to then distribute to the crowd.
\v 7 They also had a few small¦28717 cooked fish, so he¦28725 blessed¦28722 them too and¦28719 got them to distribute them as well.
\v 8 After all the people had eaten and were full, they collected seven¦28752 basketfulls¦28753 of leftovers.
\v 9 There were some four¦28761 thousand¦28761 people there that day, and¦28761 Yeshua sent¦28763 them home after they'd eaten¦28759.
\v 10 And he and his¦28779 apprentices¦28778 climbed into the boat¦28775 and headed for the Dalmanutha¦28791 region.
\s1 The religious leaders want to see a miracle
\r (Mat. 16:1-4)
\p
\v 11 \x + \xo 8:11: \xt Mat 12:38; Luk 11:16.\x*Some men from the Pharisee¦28799 party¦28799 came¦28796 out to Yeshua amd started arguing with him. They were checking him out and wanted to see a miracle.
\v 12 \x + \xo 8:12: \xt Mat 12:39; Luk 11:29.\x*Yeshua grieved inside and asked, “Why do you people need to see a miracle before you'll believe me? Actually, no miracle will be done for this generation.”
\p
\v 13 So Yeshua left in the boat again¦28853 and crossed to the other side of the lake.
\s1 The apprentices miss the significance of what's happening
\r (Mat. 16:5-12)
\p
\v 14 But Yeshua's apprentices forgot¦28864 to take¦28868 any food other than one bun that someone in the boat¦28884 had.
\v 15 \x + \xo 8:15: \xt Luk 12:1.\x*He told them, “Watch out for the yeast of the Pharisees and¦28898 of King Herod¦28904.”
\p
\v 16 They asked each other what it meant—was it because¦28912 they forgot food?
\p
\v 17 But Yeshua¦28921 knew what they were saying¦28922 and asked, “Why are you all discussing about not having food? Can't you figure it¦28919 out? Or are your¦28951 minds completely closed?
\v 18 \x + \xo 8:18: \xt Jer 5:21; Eze 12:2; Mrk 4:12.\x*You all have eyes¦28952 but can't seem to see and have ears¦28961 but can't seem to listen. Have you already forgotten what just happened?
\v 19 When I broke¦28981 up the five buns to feed five thousand¦28984 people, how many basketfulls¦28987 of leftovers did you collect?”
\p “Twelve¦28995,” they answered.
\p
\v 20 “And when we fed four¦29004 thousand¦29004 with seven¦29000 buns, how many full baskets¦29007 of leftovers then?”
\p “Seven¦29021,” they¦29019 answered.
\p
\v 21 Yeshua asked, “How can you all not understand¦29031 what's going on right in front of you!”
\s1 Yeshua heals a blind man near Bethsaida
\p
\v 22 As they entered Bethsaida, the people brought a blind¦29042 man¦29042 to Yeshua and asked him to touch¦29048 him.
\v 23 So Yeshua took the man's hand¦29054 and led him out of the village¦29064. Then he spat in his eyes¦29070, placed his hands¦29075 on him, and asked him, “What can you see?”
\p
\v 24 The man looked¦29090 around and answered, “I can see the people¦29097, but they just look like trees¦29101.”
\v 25 Yeshua touched the man's eyes¦29115 again¦29106 and then he could see clearly—he was now completely better.
\v 26 Then Yeshua told him not to go back into the village¦29165 but to go straight home¦29146.
\s1 Yeshua asks who they think he is
\r (Mat. 16:13-20; Luk. 9:18-21)
\p
\v 27 Then Yeshua¦29177 and his¦29181 followers moved around the various villages¦29184 of Caesaria Philippi. On the way, he asked them, “Who does everyone¦29206 think I am?”
\p
\v 28 \x + \xo 8:28: \xt Mrk 6:14-15; Luk 9:7-8.\x*They said, “Some say John-the-Immerser, some say Elijah, and¦29220 some say one of the prophets¦29231.”
\p
\v 29 \x + \xo 8:29: \xt Jn 6:68-69.\x*Then he asked, “And what do you all think?”
\p Peter said, “You are the promised one sent by God.”
\p
\v 30 Then Yeshua warned¦29263 them not to tell others about him¦29272.
\s1 Yeshua's radical challenge to his would-be followers
\r (Mat. 16:21-28; Luk. 9:22-27)
\p
\v 31 Then Yeshua began¦29276 teaching¦29277 his followers that humankind's child would need to suffer¦29286 a lot, to be rejected¦29288 by the religious leaders, and so to be put to death but to come back to life after¦29303 three¦29305 days¦29307.
\v 32 He taught this very clearly, but Peter took him aside¦29316 and told him off.
\v 33 Yeshua turned¦29327 back and looked at the others, then reprimanded Peter, “Stand back, Satan¦29343! you're¦29346 applying human¦29353 values instead of considering God's plan.”
\p
\v 34 \x + \xo 8:34: \xt Mat 10:38; Luk 14:27.\x*Calling out to them and to the crowd¦29357, he said¦29362, “Anyone who wants to follow me must first put aside their own desires and then follow me—even through very difficult times.
\v 35 \x + \xo 8:35: \xt Mat 10:39; Luk 17:33; Jn 12:25.\x*Anyone who worries about saving¦29413 their own life will lose it, but whoever gives their life due to following me and my teaching will save their life.
\v 36 Because¦29416 it¦29418 doesn't benefit¦29418 a person¦29420 if they gain everything in the world¦29426 but lose their soul¦29434.
\v 37 What can someone offer in order to buy a home for their soul¦29445?
\v 38 Yes, whoever¦29449 is ashamed of me and my¦29454 message¦29462 in front of this adulterous¦29468 and sinful¦29470 generation¦29465, humankind's child will likewise be ashamed of them when he comes clearly displaying God's greatness and bringing the holy messengers¦29489.”
\c 9
\p
\v 1 And he continued, “I can assure you that some of the ones standing here won't die until¦29515 they have seen God's powerful¦29524 kingdom¦29519 arrive.”
\s1 Moses and Elijah speak with Yeshua
\r (Mat. 17:1-13; Luk. 9:28-36)
\p
\v 2 \x + \xo 9:2-7: \xt 2Pe 1:17-18.\x*Six days¦29527 later Yeshua¦29531 took Peter and Jacob¦29537 and John¦29540, and just the four of them went up onto a high hill. Then he¦29558 was changed right in front of their eyes
\v 3 and¦29566 his¦29569 clothes¦29568 turned incredibly shining¦29572 white—whiter than any bleach could make them.
\v 4 And Elijah and Moses appeared beside Yeshua¦29606 and started talking with him.
\v 5 Peter said to Yeshua¦29615, “Teacher, it's good¦29617 that we're here. Maybe we could make three¦29629 shelters up here: one for you¦29631 and one for Moses and one for Elijah?”
\v 6 He said that because¦29650 they¦29651 were terrified¦29649 and didn't know what to say.
\p
\v 7 \x + \xo 9:7: \xt Mat 3:17; Mrk 1:11; Luk 3:22.\x*Then a cloud came over the sun and a voice¦29663 came out of the cloud saying, “This is my¦29674 dear son. Listen to him.”
\v 8 When they looked¦29686 around¦29686, they couldn't see anyone else there any more, except¦29693 for Yeshua¦29697 himself.
\p
\v 9 As they descended again, Yeshua told them to tell no one what had happened up there until after humankind's child came back to life.
\p
\v 10 They remembered that, although between all three of them they¦29735 couldn't understand the bit about coming back to life.
\v 11 \x + \xo 9:11: \xt Mal 4:5; Mat 11:14.\x*They asked Yeshua, “Isn't it¦29764 written that Elijah will be the first¦29767 to return?”
\p
\v 12 He answered, “Yes, Elijah is indeed¦29777 the one to come¦29778 first¦29780 to start the restoration¦29781. But isn't it¦29789 also written¦29789 that humankind's child will suffer¦29797 a lot and¦29798 be scorned¦29799?
\v 13 You see, Elijah has come¦29809 already, and they treated him just however they liked, just like it was written¦29818 that it would happen.”
\s1 Yeshua drives out a stubborn demon
\r (Mat. 17:14-21; Luk. 9:37-43a)
\p
\v 14 When they got back to \add his other\add* followers¦29827, Yeshua saw¦29828 that they were surrounded by a large crowd¦29831 and¦29836 the religious¦29838 teachers¦29838 were debating¦29839 with them.
\v 15 The crowd¦29849 were very surprised when they noticed Yeshua and came running¦29861 to greet¦29862 him.
\v 16 He asked¦29865 them, “\wj What were you¦29870 all talking about?\wj*”
\p
\v 17 One of the people answered¦29878, “Teacher¦29887, I brought¦29888 my¦29891 son here—he has a demon that prevents him from speaking.
\v 18 Whenever it takes hold of him, it attacks¦29904 him and he starts foaming¦29907 at the mouth and grating¦29909 his teeth¦29911 and his joints lock up. I tried to get your¦29920 followers¦29919 to command it to leave but they couldn't.”
\p
\v 19 Yeshua replied, “\wj You are a faithless generation¦29941. How much longer will I have to be here? How much longer can I tolerate¦29953 you all? Bring him¦29957 here.\wj*”
\v 20 So they brought¦29962 the boy to him. When he saw Yeshua, the demon immediately¦29972 caused him to have convulsions¦29973 and fall on the ground¦29981—rolling¦29982 over and foaming¦29983 at the mouth.
\p
\v 21 Yeshua asked¦29985 his¦29989 father¦29988, “\wj How long has this been happening?\wj*”
\p “Since he was small,” he replied,
\v 22 “and often¦30009 it throws¦30016 him into the fire¦30014 or into water¦30019 to try to destroy¦30022 him. But if you feel sorry for us and can do it, please help¦30031 us.”
\p
\v 23 Yeshua¦30040 asked him¦30042, “\wj If I can? A person who believes¦30052 can do anything.\wj*”
\p
\v 24 The boys father¦30059 cried¦30056 out, “I do believe¦30069—help¦30071 me to fight unbelief¦30075.”
\p
\v 25 Then Yeshua¦30083 noticing that a big crowd¦30088 was quickly forming, scolded the evil spirit, “\wj You spirit who causes muteness and deafness. Leave this boy now and never return to him.\wj*”
\p
\v 26 There was yelling and strong convulsions¦30123, and then the demon left¦30125 him and the boy lay still as if dead¦30132, and many people thought he was.
\v 27 But Yeshua¦30142 took his¦30147 hand¦30146 and lifted it, and the boy got up.
\p
\v 28 When Yeshua and his¦30166 apprentices¦30165 had gone into the house¦30160 by themselves¦30170, they asked him, “How come¦30155 we couldn't drive it¦30187 out?”
\p
\v 29 He replied, “This kind will only leave after prayer¦30203 and¦30204 fasting¦30205.”
\s1 Yeshua talks again about being executed
\r (Mat. 17:22-23; Luk. 9:43b-45)
\p
\v 30 Then they¦30211 left that place and¦30215 were moving around Galilee¦30214, because Yeshua didn't want people to know¦30220 where he¦30217 was
\v 31 while he was teaching¦30222 his¦30226 apprentices¦30225. He told them, “humankind's child will be arrested and executed, but after¦30247 three¦30249 days¦30251 he'll come back to life.”
\p
\v 32 But they didn't know what that meant, and they were too scared to ask¦30264 him¦30262.
\s1 How to be the best
\r (Mat. 18:1-5; Luk. 9:46-48)
\p
\v 33 Then they went Capernaum¦30270 and when they arrived at the house¦30274, Yeshua asked them what they were discussing on the way¦30281.
\p
\v 34 \x + \xo 9:34: \xt Luk 22:24.\x*But they didn't reply because¦30294 while they were walking, they had been talking about which of them is the best.
\v 35 \x + \xo 9:35: \xt Mat 20:26-27; 23:11; Mrk 10:43-44; Luk 22:26.\x*So Yeshua sat¦30309 down and called¦30310 the twelve¦30312 of them and explained, “\wj Whoever wants to be at the top, has to be at the bottom and help all the others.\wj*”
\v 36 Then Yeshua called a young boy and stood¦30331 him in the middle of them, and giving him a hug said¦30343,
\v 37 \x + \xo 9:37: \xt Mat 10:40; Luk 10:16; Jn 13:20.\x*“Whoever¦30345 welcomes young children¦30352 on my¦30360 behalf, welcomes me, and¦30363 whoever¦30364 welcomes me is not actually welcoming me, but¦30374 welcoming the one who sent¦30376 me here.”
\s1 Others are also serving Yeshua
\r (Luk. 9:49-50)
\p
\v 38 John¦30385 checked with Yeshua, “Teacher¦30389, we saw¦30390 someone¦30392 using your¦30396 authority to command demons¦30398 to leave, but we told him off because¦30410 he wasn't one of us.”
\p
\v 39 Yeshua¦30417 responded, “No, don't¦30420 stop him¦30422 because¦30424 anyone who does a miracle¦30428 using my¦30433 name¦30432 won't just quickly¦30437 turn around and slander me.
\v 40 \x + \xo 9:40: \xt Mat 12:30; Luk 11:23.\x*Anyone who's not against¦30445 us is for us.
\v 41 \x + \xo 9:41: \xt Mat 10:42.\x* Anyone who gives you water¦30460 to drink¦30457 because you are followers of God's chosen¦30467 one and who does it because they are working for me, I can assure you that they'll receive their reward¦30479.
\s1 Difficult teachings about disobedience
\r (Mat. 18:6-9; Luk. 17:1-2)
\p
\v 42 But anyone who causes a young person to falter from their trust in me, it¦30498 would be better¦30497 if they were thrown¦30517 into the sea¦30521 with a heavy¦30509 weight tied around their neck.
\v 43 \x + \xo 9:43: \xt Mat 5:30.\x*If your¦30529 hand¦30528 causes you to disobey God, cut it off—it's better¦30532 to enter \add eternal\add* life¦30541 being maimed¦30537, than to have two¦30546 hands¦30547 but to be thrown into the fire¦30559 that never goes out.
\v 44 ≈
\v 45 And if your¦30578 foot¦30577 causes you to disobey God, cut it off—it's better¦30586 to enter \add eternal\add* life¦30596 being maimed, than to have two¦30604 feet¦30605 but to be thrown¦30608 into hell.
\v 46 ≈
\v 47 \x + \xo 9:47: \xt Mat 5:29.\x*And if your¦30634 eye¦30633 causes you to disobey God, gouge it out—it's better¦30641 to enter God's kingdom¦30649 one-eyed¦30645, than to have two¦30654 eyes¦30655 and be thrown into hell
\v 48 where¦30664 the worms never die and¦30670 the fire¦30672 never goes out.

\v 49 Everyone will be salted¦30679 with fire¦30678.
\p
\v 50 \x + \xo 9:50: \xt Mat 5:13; Luk 14:34-35.\x*Now salt is good¦30687, but¦30692 if it¦30702 were to go bad, what would you¦30703 season¦30703 \add your food\add* with then? So keep yourselves¦30708 like salt, and¦30712 strive to get on well with each other.

\s1 It's God that joins husband and wife
\r (Mat. 19:1-12; Luk. 16:18)
\p
\v 1 Then Yeshua left there¦30718 and went down to the Judean area and across the Jordan¦30731 river. Again the crowds¦30739 followed him, and he taught¦30747 them just like he usually did.
\p
\v 2 Some from the Pharisee¦30753 party¦30753 approached¦30750 Yeshua to check him out and asked, “Does the law allow a husband¦30762 to dismiss his wife¦30763?”
\p
\v 3 “Well, what law did Moses give to you¦30773 all?” he¦30767 asked.
\p
\v 4 \x + \xo 10:4: \xt Deu 24:1-4; Mat 5:31.\x*They answered, “Moses said¦30779 that a husband is allowed to write¦30787 a statement of divorce¦30785 and¦30788 dismiss his wife with it.”
\p
\v 5 Yeshua¦30794 responded, “Yes, he wrote¦30801 that law because¦30803 he saw your¦30800 stubborn desires,
\v 6 \x + \xo 10:6: \xt Gen 1:27; 5:2.\x*but¦30808 God made both men and¦30812 women right at the beginning¦30809.
\v 7 \x + \xo 10:7-8: \xt Gen 2:24.\x*As a result, a man¦30825 leaves his parents and joins together with his wife¦30839
\v 8 and the couple become a single unit. So there's no longer¦30851 two of them, but only one.
\v 9 So if it's God¦30861 who joins them together¦30863 like that, no person¦30864 \add has the authority\add* to separate¦30866 them.”
\p
\v 10 Back in the house¦30874 again¦30876, his apprentices¦30879 asked about this.
\v 11 \x + \xo 10:11-12: \xt Mat 5:32; 1Cor 7:10-11.\x*And Yeshua told them, “Whoever¦30897 divorces his wife and marries another¦30911 person, commits adultery¦30913 towards his wife.”
\v 12 And likewise if the wife divorces her husband and marries another¦30935 person, she is committing adultery¦30938 towards her husband.”
\s1 Yeshua encourages childlike faith
\r (Mat. 19:13-15; Luk. 18:15-17)
\p
\v 13 The people were bringing¦30940 small¦30942 children¦30942 for Yeshua to touch¦30946, but¦30948 his apprentices¦30949 scolded them.
\v 14 However, Yeshua¦30959 noticed it and was upset, “Just let those kids come. Don't prevent them because¦30979 God's kingdom¦30983 consists of people like them.
\v 15 \x + \xo 10:15: \xt Mat 18:3.\x*Actually, you can't even enter God's kingdom¦30997 unless you accept it¦31006 just like a small¦31001 child¦31001 does.”
\v 16 So he continued hugging the children and \add commanding\add* a good life for them as he placed his hands¦31017 on each one.
\s1 Leaving behind everything to be saved
\r (Mat. 19:16-30; Luk. 18:18-30)
\p
\v 17 One time when Yeshua was starting out on a trip, a man caught up to him and kneeling down in front of him asked, “Good teacher, what do I have to do to inherit¦31049 eternal¦31048 life¦31047?”
\p
\v 18 He answered, “Why do you call me \em good\em*? No person is good—only God¦31066 is.
\v 19 \x + \xo 10:19: a \xt Exo 20:13; Deu 5:17; \xo b \xt Exo 20:14; Deu 5:18; \xo c \xt Exo 20:15; Deu 5:19; \xo d \xt Exo 20:16; Deu 5:20; \xo e \xt Exo 20:12; Deu 5:16.\x*You know the commandments¦31068: don't murder¦31074, don't commit¦31076 adultery¦31076, don't steal¦31078, don't lie about others, don't defraud¦31083 others, and¦31089 honour¦31085 your¦31088 parents.”
\p
\v 20 The man responded, “I've kept¦31104 all of those since I was young.”
\p
\v 21 Yeshua¦31115 looked up at him with genuine love and said¦31122, “There's one thing¦31129 still to be done: sell everything you have and give¦31138 the money to the poor—then you'll have wealth in heaven¦31145. After that, come¦31148 and follow¦31149 me.”
\v 22 But the man grew very sad when he heard this, because¦31177 he owned many properties¦31179.
\p
\v 23 Yeshua¦31185 looked¦31183 around¦31183 at his¦31190 followers¦31189, “It's so difficult¦31192 for wealthy¦31195 people to enter God's kingdom¦31199.”
\p
\v 24 His¦31211 followers¦31205 were a bit stunned at his¦31211 teaching.) Yeshua¦31214 continued, “Yes, it's certainly difficult¦31222 to enter into God's kingdom¦31231.
\v 25 It's easier¦31236 for a camel¦31240 to go through the eye¦31244 of a needle¦31248 than for a rich person to enter God's kingdom¦31257.”
\p
\v 26 Now they¦31262 were totally stunned, asking, “How can anyone possibly be saved¦31274 then?”
\p
\v 27 Yeshua¦31279 looked intently at them, “Yes, humanly¦31284 it's quite impossible¦31286. But with God it's different—God can do anything!”
\p
\v 28 Peter said, “We left everything and came and followed¦31315 you¦31317.”
\p
\v 29 He answered, “Yes I can assure you¦31332 all that whoever left their home or farm, and left their siblings or parents or children¦31352 because of me and my¦31356 teaching,
\v 30 they'll be rewarded one hundred¦31369 times over with homes and farms¦31392 and siblings and parents and children¦31390 along with persecution¦31394, but gaining eternal¦31403 life¦31402 in the next era.
\v 31 \x + \xo 10:31: \xt Mat 20:16; Luk 13:30.\x*But many at the top now will be at the bottom then, and¦31411 many at the bottom now will be blessed then.”
\s1 Yeshua predicts his execution a third time
\r (Mat. 20:17-19; Luk. 18:31-34)
\p
\v 32 They were heading south to Jerusalem¦31422 with Yeshua in front, and his followers¦31435 were a bit surprised and a bit scared. Yeshua took the twelve¦31442 aside and started telling¦31445 them what was going to happen¦31449 to him,
\v 33 “We're on our way down to Jerusalem¦31454 and humankind's child will be turned over to the chief¦31462 priests¦31462 and the religious¦31465 teachers¦31465, and they'll sentence him to die and pass him over to the non-Jews¦31475.
\v 34 Then they'll ridicule him and spit on him before they beat him and execute him, but he'll come back to life again in three¦31496 days¦31498 time.”
\s1 How to become respected in God's kingdom
\r (Mat. 20:20-28)
\p
\v 35 Then Jacob¦31507 and John¦31509, the two¦31511 sons¦31512 of Zebedee¦31513 approached¦31505 Yeshua and asked, “Teacher¦31518, we'd like to ask a favour from you—please don't disappoint us.”
\p
\v 36 “What do you want from me?” Yeshua asked.
\p
\v 37 They answered, “Allow us two to sit¦31566 beside you in heaven—one of us on each side of you.”
\p
\v 38 \x + \xo 10:38: \xt Luk 12:50.\x*But Yeshua¦31577 replied, “You don't¦31582 even understand what you're asking for. Do you think you could endure the suffering that I have to go through? Or to be enveloped in the darkness that I have to go down into?”
\p
\v 39 And they replied, “Sure we can.”
\p “And indeed you all will suffer like me and be enveloped in darkness like I will be,” responded Yeshua¦31612,
\v 40 but as for deciding who will sit¦31632 next to me, that's not my¦31635 decision to make because¦31646 it's already been decided.”
\p
\v 41 When the ten¦31659 other apprentices heard¦31656 what these two had asked for, they were upset at Jacob¦31669 and¦31670 John¦31671.
\v 42 \x + \xo 10:42-43: \xt Luk 22:25-26.\x*But Yeshua¦31679 called¦31676 them over, “Listen, in most countries their rulers boss the people around and¦31693 their leaders exert their authority¦31699 over them.
\v 43 \x + \xo 10:43-44: \xt Mat 23:11; Mrk 9:35; Luk 22:26.\x*But it¦31705 doesn't work like that with you—anyone of you who wanted to be honoured must serve the others,
\v 44 and¦31727 whoever¦31728 wants to become the most respected has to \add work\add* like a slave¦31741 does.
\v 45 Even¦31747 humankind's child didn't come to be served¦31750, but¦31751 to serve¦31752 others and¦31753 to give¦31754 his¦31757 life¦31756 as a ransom¦31759 to set many people free.
\s1 Blind Bartimeus gets his miracle
\r (Mat. 20:29-34; Luk. 18:35-43)
\p
\v 46 They arrived at Jericho, and then when Yeshua and his¦31777 followers¦31776 were leaving again with a large¦31780 crowd¦31779 following, they¦31763 came across blind¦31786 Bartimeus¦31784 sitting¦31789 beside¦31790 the path begging.
\v 47 When he heard¦31796 that it was Yeshua from Nazareth¦31803 going past, he yelled out, “Yeshua, \add promised\add* descendant of David¦31812, help me please.”
\p
\v 48 When several people told him to stop, he just yelled out even louder, “Yeshua, \add promised\add* descendant of David¦31830, please help me.”
\p
\v 49 Then Yeshua¦31836 stopped¦31834 and got the people to call the blind¦31848 man¦31848. So they called him, “Hey, be confident! Get up and come because he's called for you.”
\p
\v 50 So Bartimeus threw off his¦31863 jacket, jumped¦31864 up, and was led to Yeshua¦31870.
\p
\v 51 “Now, what can I do for you?” Yeshua¦31876 asked.
\p “My teacher¦31890, I'd like to be able to see,” Bartimeus replied.
\p
\v 52 Then Yeshua responded, “Ok, off you go then—your¦31903 faith¦31902 has saved¦31904 you.”
\p And immediately¦31908 Bartimeus was able to see, and followed¦31911 along the path¦31917 after¦31912 Yeshua.
\c 11
\s1 Yeshua is treated like a king as he enters Jerusalem
\r (Mat. 21:1-11; Luk. 19:28-40; Jn 12:12-19)
\p
\v 1 As they¦31920 got close to Jerusalem¦31923 and were passing Bethphage and Bethany¦31931 on the Mount¦31934 of Olives¦31937, Yeshua sent two¦31940 of his¦31943 apprentices¦31942 ahead, telling them,
\v 2 “Go on to the next village¦31953 and as you enter¦31960 it, you'll see a young donkey that hasn't ever been ridden yet. Untie it and bring¦31984 it back here.
\v 3 If anyone¦31989 asks what you're doing¦31994, tell them that the master¦32002 needs it and he'll return it later.”
\p
\v 4 So they went ahead and found¦32021 a donkey tied up on the path just outside¦32028 the door¦32027 of a house, and so they went to untie it.
\v 5 But some of the people standing around there¦32039 said, “Hoy! What do you think you're doing¦32045 untying that donkey?”
\p
\v 6 So they¦32062 responded just as Yeshua¦32060 had told them, and¦32061 the people allowed¦32062 them to proceed.
\v 7 They brought the young donkey to Yeshua, placing their¦32081 coats¦32079 over it before Yeshua mounted it.
\v 8 \add As Yeshua rode it into Jerusalem,\add* many people laid their¦32097 coats¦32095 on the road¦32104, while others¦32106 lay down leafy¦32108 branches¦32108 cut from trees in nearby fields¦32114.
\v 9 \x + \xo 11:9: \xt Psa 118:25-26.\x*Some went ahead and others came along behind, shouting, “This is the saviour¦32130 who comes with the authority and blessing¦32131 from God—
\v 10 the promised ancestor of King David¦32148 who is blessed as he ushers in his kingdom¦32141—the blessed saviour¦32149 from heaven.”
\p
\v 11 And so Yeshua arrived in Jerusalem¦32158 and went into the temple¦32164 and looked¦32166 all around¦32166, but because it was now evening¦32168, he went back out to Bethania village with his twelve¦32180 apprentices.
\s1 Yeshua curses a fig tree
\r (Mat. 21:18-19)
\p
\v 12 The next day¦32183 after they'd left Bethania, Yeshua was hungry.
\v 13 From a distance he noticed a fig¦32197 tree¦32197 that was in leaf so he went over to see if there was any fruit on it, but when he reached it there was only leaves because¦32238 it wasn't the right season¦32241 for figs¦32245.
\v 14 So he spoke to the tree, “No one in this age will ever eat¦32272 fruit¦32270 from you again.” (His¦32279 followers¦32278 heard him say that.)
\s1 Yeshua upsets the traders inside the temple
\r (Mat. 21:12-17; Luk. 19:45-48; Jn 2:13-22)
\p
\v 15 Then they came back into Jerusalem¦32285 and on into the temple where Yeshua started driving¦32299 out the sellers and the buyers that were trading in there. Then he tipped over the tables¦32313 of the money-changers¦32315 and the chairs of the ones selling doves¦32324,
\v 16 and stopped others from carrying¦32333 goods through the temple¦32340.
\v 17 \x + \xo 11:17: a \xt Isa 56:7; \xo b \xt Jer 7:11.\x*He said, “Isn't it written¦32348 in the Scriptures,
\q1 ‘My¦32352 house will be known as a house of prayer¦32354 for all the nations¦32358’?
\m But all of you have turned it into a sanctuary for swindlers.”
\p
\v 18 When the chief¦32371 priests¦32371 and the religious¦32375 teachers¦32375 heard¦32369 this, they started looking¦32378 for¦32378 a way that they could destroy¦32381 him, because¦32384 they were afraid of him and the way that the crowd¦32390 marvelled at this teaching.
\p
\v 19 Every evening¦32400, Yeshua and his apprentices would go out of the city¦32408 to stay overnight.
\s1 Yeshua gives a lesson on moving mountains
\r (Mat. 21:20-22)
\p
\v 20 As they¦32417 entered the city again in the morning¦32415, Yeshua's apprentices noticed that the fig¦32419 tree¦32419 was totally dead.
\v 21 Peter remembered what he had said to the tree, and commented, “Teacher, that fig¦32433 tree that you cursed¦32435 has withered¦32436 up.”
\p
\v 22 Yeshua¦32441 responded, “Use your faith¦32446 in God¦32448.
\v 23 \x + \xo 11:23: \xt Mat 17:20; 1Cor 13:2.\x*I can assure you¦32452 that if anyone tells a mountain¦32459 to go into the sea¦32468 and doesn't doubt¦32471 in their mind¦32475 but believes¦32479 that what they're saying¦32451 will happen, then it¦32471 will.
\v 24 So I tell you all that anything you ask God for in your prayers, if you believe¦32507 that you have received¦32509 it¦32514, then you will.

\s1 The leaders question Yeshua's authority
\r (Mat. 21:23-27; Luk. 20:1-8)
\p
\v 26 ≈
\v 27 They continued on into Jerusalem¦32569 and on to the temple¦32573 where they¦32565 were met by the chief¦32580 priests¦32580 and the religious¦32583 teachers¦32583 and the elders¦32586.
\v 28 They asked Yeshua, “Do you have any authority to do what you did? If so, who gave it to you?”
\p
\v 29 Yeshua¦32614 answered, “Ok, I'll also ask you something and when you answer¦32628 me I'll tell you about my authority¦32638 to do that:
\v 30 When John¦32644 \add preached and\add* immersed¦32642 people, did the authority for that come from heaven¦32649 or from people here?”
\p
\v 31 They discussed this among themselves¦32663, reasoning¦32659, “If we say¦32669 it was from heaven¦32671, he'll ask us why we didn't believe¦32680 him¦32681.
\v 32 But we¦32684 can't say¦32684 that it was just from people.” (They said that because¦32695 they were scared of the crowds¦32691, knowing that they believed that John¦32699 was a prophet¦32704.)
\v 33 So they¦32711 answered¦32707, “We don't¦32712 know.”
\p And Yeshua¦32717 also responded, “Well then, I won't tell you¦32725 about my authority¦32730 to do those things¦32732 either.”

\s1 The parable about the tenants killing the owner's son
\r (Mat. 21:33-46; Luk. 20:9-19)
\p
\v 1 \x + \xo 12:1: \xt Isa 5:1-2.\x*Then he started telling them some parables¦32738: “A man¦32743 planted¦32745 a vineyard¦32741 and put a fence¦32750 and a moat around¦32748 it and built¦32756 a \add security\add* tower¦32757. Then he rented¦32759 it out and went off travelling¦32765.
\v 2 At harvest time, he sent a slave¦32773 to go to the tenant farmers and get his \add percentage\add* of the harvest.
\v 3 But the tenants grabbed the slave and beat him up, then sent¦32798 him back empty-handed¦32799.
\v 4 The owner sent¦32804 a second slave¦32808, but they¦32813 insulted this one and struck¦32813 him on the head.
\v 5 So the owner sent a third slave and they murdered him. He sent many other slaves—some they just beat up and others they murdered.
\v 6 But the owner still¦32845 had his one, dearly loved¦32854 son, so finally he sent¦32857 him to go, thinking that they would now be convinced because it was his son.
\v 7 But the tenant¦32875 farmers¦32875 said¦32883 to each others, ‘Ah ha. This is the one who will inherit¦32896 this land. If we kill¦32890 \em him¦32891\em*, we'll be the ones to control the estate.’
\v 8 So they took him and killed¦32900 him, and threw the body outside¦32906 the vineyard¦32908 fence.
\p
\v 9 “Now, what do you think the owner of the vineyard will do? Yes, he'll come and eliminate those \add evil\add* tenants¦32920, and give the contract to others¦32925.
\v 10 \x + \xo 12:10-11: \xt Psa 118:22-23.\x*Haven't¦32932 you all read this in the scriptures¦32928:

\q1 became the \add important\add* cornerstone¦32941
\q1
\v 11 that was given by the master¦32943,
\q1 and¦32946 we think it's incredible.’?”
\p
\v 12 And those leaders tried to arrest him because they knew¦32960 that it was them that the parable¦32966 was addressed to, but they couldn't do it because \add Yeshua had the favour\add* of the crowd¦32959, so they just left the area.

\r (Mat. 22:15-22; Luk. 20:20-26)
\p
\v 13 Then the religious leaders sent some members of the Pharisee¦32981 party¦32981 and¦32982 some of the \add political\add* supporters¦32984 of King Herod¦32984 to try to catch¦32988 Yeshua out.
\v 14 So they \add flattered\add* him, “Teacher¦33004, we know that you are honest even if it upsets others, and that you teach¦33028 the truth¦33023 about God¦33027 without caring¦33011 about people's¦33020 opinions. Is it legal \add for us Jews\add* to pay the poll tax¦33038 to the Roman emperor or not? How should we handle this?”
\p
\v 15 But knowing¦33052 their¦33053 hypocrisy¦33055, Yeshua responded to them, “Why are you¦33060 trying to test me? Bring me a coin so we can determine the proper answer.”
\p
\v 16 When they brought¦33071 him a coin, he asked, “Whose image¦33077 and inscription¦33081 are on this coin?”
\p And they said¦33084, “The emperor's.”
\p
\v 17 “Well then,” said Yeshua¦33094, “give to the emperor whatever is due him, but give God what is owed to God.”
\p And they had to admit that that was an outstanding answer.
\s1 Yeshua explains that those who've died are alive
\r (Mat. 22:23-33; Luk. 20:27-40)
\p
\v 18 \x + \xo 12:18: \xt Acts 23:8.\x*Another time, members of the Sadducee sect came to Yeshua and¦33128 asked,
\v 19 \x + \xo 12:19: \xt Deu 25:5.\x*“Teacher¦33134, Moses wrote¦33136 that if a man's married brother should die before his wife without having any children¦33156, then his brother should marry her to produce descendants in his brother's name.
\v 20 Now what if there were seven¦33176 brothers¦33178 and the first¦33185 one got married and died childless.
\v 21 So then the second¦33197 brother took¦33198 her¦33199 in, but again died¦33201 childless, and then the third¦33212.
\v 22 Eventually all seven¦33221 brothers died childless, and finally the woman¦33233 also died.
\v 23 Now, at the resurrection¦33238 of the dead, which¦33242 brother will she be the wife of, because at some point, she was married to each of the seven¦33250 of them?”
\p
\v 24 So Yeshua¦33260 answered, “Actually you're all quite wrong, because you ignore the scriptures¦33271 and also because you haven't experienced God's power¦33274.
\v 25 When the dead¦33281 do come back to life, they won't be getting engaged or married, but will be like the messengers¦33297 in heaven¦33301.
\v 26 \x + \xo 12:26: \xt Exo 3:6.\x*And as for the state of those who've died, didn't you¦33311 read in the scriptures about Moses when God spoke¦33325 to him¦33326 in front of the \add burning\add* thorn¦33321 bush and said, ‘I am the God of Abraham¦33334 and the God of Isaac¦33338 and the God of Jacob¦33342’?
\v 27 So God is not the God of the dead¦33347, but¦33348 of the living¦33350. You Sadducees are very wrong!”
\s1 Yeshua answers about genuine obedience to God
\r (Mat. 22:34-40; Luk. 10:25-28)
\p
\v 28 Then one of the religious¦33360 teachers¦33360 who had heard¦33361 their¦33363 question and Yeshua's excellent answer¦33372, came closer and asked¦33374, “Which¦33378 of the commandments¦33380 is the most important?”
\p
\v 29 \x + \xo 12:29-30: \xt Deu 6:4-5.\x*Yeshua¦33392 answered¦33388, “Well, the most important is this: ‘Listen, Israel. There's only one God¦33410 who is our¦33411 master.
\v 30 You must love God¦33419 your master¦33417 with all your heart¦33424 and with all your soul¦33431 and with all your mind¦33424 and with all your strength¦33444.’
\v 31 \x + \xo 12:31: \xt Lev 19:18.\x*And the second¦33450 is: ‘Love your¦33461 neighbour¦33460 like \add you¦33461 look after\add* yourself¦33463.’ There's no other commandments¦33468 more important than these¦33466.”
\p
\v 32 \x + \xo 12:32: \xt Deu 4:35.\x*The teacher replied to Yeshua, “Yes, teacher, you're quite right saying there's¦33492 only one God and¦33490 no other,
\v 33 \x + \xo 12:33: \xt Hos 6:6.\x* and saying that we should love him with all our heart¦33503 and all our intelligence¦33511 and all our strength¦33522, and to be loving our neighbours¦33527 like we \add look after\add* ourselves, and all this is more important¦33532 than all the required temple offerings¦33537 and sacrifices¦33540.”
\p
\v 34 \x + \xo 12:28-34: \xt Luk 10:25-28.\x*When Yeshua saw that he had given such a thoughtful answer¦33548, he said¦33549, “You are very close to the kingdom¦33557 of God¦33559!”
\p After that, no one else dared to ask¦33566 Yeshua any more questions.
\s1 Yeshua asks about the messiah being a descendant of David
\r (Mat. 22:41-46; Luk. 20:41-44)
\p
\v 35 Later when Yeshua¦33572 was teaching in the temple¦33578, he asked the people, “How is it that the teachers¦33583 here say that the messiah¦33586 is a descendant of King David¦33589?
\v 36 \x + \xo 12:36: \xt Psa 110:1.\x* Because David¦33595 himself¦33592 said under the inspiration of the holy spirit¦33599,
\q1 ‘The master told my¦33608 master,
\q2 “Sit there in the position of honour
\q2 until¦33614 I can conquer your¦33621 enemies¦33619.” ’
\m
\v 37 If David¦33629 calls him his master¦33632, how can he possibly be his descendant?”
\p The large crowd¦33644 was very interested to hear¦33646 everything that Yeshua had to say.
\s1 Yeshua warns about smartly-dressed teachers
\r (Mat. 23:1-36; Luk. 20:45-47)
\p
\v 38 As Yeshua continued teaching, he said, “Watch out for these religious¦33668 teachers¦33668 who like to wear \add fancy\add* robes¦33675 and be greeted¦33678 in the square,
\v 39 and have the best seats¦33684 at meetings and the best places¦33689 at dinners.
\v 40 These¦33708 people trick widows¦33700 out of their properties, but offer long prayers to cover it up. They will be getting a stricter judgement than others.”
\s1 The sacrificial donation of a widow
\r (Luk. 21:1-4)
\p
\v 41 As he sat¦33714 down in front¦33718 of the \add temple\add* treasury, Yeshua watched the crowd¦33730 as they threw coins into \add the dish\add*, and some rich people were donating quite valuable \add silver\add* coins.
\v 42 Then an impoverished widow¦33749 came and threw in two¦33753 small \add copper\add* coins.
\v 43 Yeshua called¦33758 his¦33761 followers¦33760 and told them, “Honestly, that poor widow¦33770 gave more than all the others.
\v 44 You see, most people donate from their excess wealth¦33792, but¦33799 this woman¦33798 even gave \add some of\add* the small amount that she¦33806 needed to live on.”
\c 13
\s1 Yeshua predicts total destruction of the temple
\r (Mat. 24:1-2; Luk. 21:5-6)
\p
\v 1 As they were leaving the temple¦33817 area, one of Yeshua's followers¦33823 noted, “Teacher¦33826, look at these \add large\add* stones¦33829 and¦33830 the \add beautiful\add* buildings¦33832 that they've been made into.”
\p
\v 2 But Yeshua¦33838 responded, “Yes, incredible buildings¦33850, but \add the time will come\add* when they're torn down—not a single stone¦33861 will be left sitting in its place.”
\s1 Yeshua talks about coming hardships
\r (Mat. 24:3-14; Luk. 21:7-19)
\p
\v 3 Later when they were over on the Mount¦33885 of Olives¦33887 overlooking the temple¦33890, Peter and Jacob¦33900 and John¦33902 and Andrew¦33904 were with Yeshua and asked
\v 4 when all this destruction would happen, and¦33911 what indications there would be that it's about to happen.
\p
\v 5 So Yeshua¦33928 told them, “Be careful so that you¦33939 aren't mislead¦33940 by others.
\v 6 Plenty of people will say that they're coming¦33944 under my¦33948 authority, or that they're me, and¦33955 they'll mislead¦33958 many others.
\v 7 And whenever¦33959 you¦33961 hear¦33961 about wars or about battles about to begin, don't¦33968 be worried—these things will certainly happen, but¦33973 there's more to follow.
\v 8 Countries will take up arms against other countries¦33979, and kingdoms against other kingdom. There'll be earthquakes¦33988 in \add many\add* places¦33990 and there'll¦33992 be famines¦33993, but these¦33999 will be just like the beginning¦33997 of birth¦33998 pains¦33998.
\p
\v 9 \x + \xo 13:9-11: \xt Mat 10:17-20; Luk 12:11-12.\x*“So be careful. You'll be turned over to \add local\add* councils¦34013 \add for questioning\add*, will be whipped in the religious meeting¦34016 halls¦34016, and will be stood¦34026 in front of governors¦34021 and kings¦34025 because¦34032 of following me. But you'll be able to present your life stories to them
\v 10 and it's right that the good¦34049 news first\f + \fr 13:10 \ft TD: It's not clear here what was meant by ‘first’—‘first’ before what?\f* be proclaimed¦34047 to every country.
\v 11 But whenever¦34055 they bring¦34057 you along to hand¦34062 you over, don't¦34061 worry¦34062 in advance about what you're going to say to defend yourselves, but wait until the hearing proceeds and speak what you are given¦34071 then, because¦34083 then it won't be you speaking, but God's spirit¦34090.
\v 12 In those times, a brother will report on his brother to have him executed, and a father¦34101 report on his child, and children will be encouraged to report on their own parents¦34109 and then they'll be executed as a result.
\v 13 \x + \xo 13:13: \xt Mat 10:22.\x*And every one will hate you¦34114 all because¦34118 they hate my¦34121 name¦34120, but whoever endures¦34124 to the end¦34126 will be saved¦34128.
\s1 Yeshua warns about coming horror and deceptions
\r (Mat. 24:15-28; Luk. 21:20-24)
\p
\v 14 \x + \xo 13:14: \xt Dan 9:27; 11:31; 12:11.\x*“But whenever¦34129 you see¦34132 the most horrible thing that drives people from God, standing where¦34148 it¦34150 shouldn't be (and you readers should understand¦34153 this), then anyone in Judea¦34160 should flee into the hills
\v 15 \x + \xo 13:15-16: \xt Luk 17:31.\x*and anyone upstairs looking outside shouldn't come down into the bedrooms to get anything¦34181,
\v 16 and¦34187 anyone working outside shouldn't go back inside to get a change of clothes.
\v 17 It will be extremely difficult for pregnant women and for mothers who are breast-feeding their children¦34209 in those¦34215 days¦34217.
\v 18 Just pray that it¦34223 won't happen in the winter¦34227
\v 19 \x + \xo 13:19: \xt Dan 12:1; Rev 7:14.\x*because those¦34233 days¦34232 will be terrible like nothing that's ever happened before, all the way back to when God¦34249 created¦34244 the world right until¦34250 the present time¦34251, and¦34253 won't ever happen again.
\v 20 And if the master¦34264 hadn't shortened that time, no humans would¦34272 even survive, but he shortened that time so that the chosen¦34280 ones could be saved¦34273.
\p
\v 21 So don't¦34305 believe¦34306 it¦34306 if you¦34292 hear someone say¦34293, ‘Look, the messiah¦34299 has arrived here.’ or ‘There's the one that God has sent.’
\v 22 Plenty of fake messiahs¦34312 and deceiving prophets¦34314 will certainly come and even do things that humans can't normally do, so much so that even the chosen¦34329 ones would defect if that were possible¦34326.
\v 23 So watch¦34332 out, but I've warned you in advance about all of this.
\s1 The universe collapses as the son arrives
\r (Mat. 24:29-31; Luk. 21:25-28)
\p
\v 24 \x + \xo 13:24: a \xt Isa 13:10; Joel 2:10,31; 3:15; Rev 6:12; \xo b \xt Isa 13:10; Eze 32:7.\x*“After those¦34340 very difficult times, the sun¦34348 will go dark and¦34350 the moon¦34352 won't shine at night.
\v 25 \x + \xo 13:25: a \xt Isa 34:4; Rev 6:13; \xo b \xt Joel 2:10.\x*The stars¦34360 will fall down out of the sky¦34365 and the powers¦34372 in the heavens¦34378 will be shaken¦34381 up.
\v 26 \x + \xo 13:26: \xt Dan 7:13; Rev 1:7.\x*Then¦34388 the people will see humankind's child in the clouds¦34393 coming¦34389 with incredible power¦34397 and¦34399 brightness.
\v 27 He'll send the messengers¦34407 out to collect all the chosen¦34413 people from the four¦34417 corners of the world, from everywhere between the earth¦34423 and¦34409 the sky.
\s1 Watch out for the change in season
\r (Mat. 24:32-35; Luk. 21:29-33)
\p
\v 28 So learn¦34433 a lesson from fig¦34432 trees—whenever¦34436 the branches¦34440 green up and start sprouting¦34445 leaves¦34447 and then everyone knows that summer¦34456 is close.
\v 29 So too whenever¦34461 you see¦34463 all these¦34465 things¦34465 happening, you know that the end \add of this current world\add* is close.
\v 30 I can assure you that the generation¦34485 of people who see these things won't die off before these latter things happen.
\v 31 The sky and¦34497 the planet might collapse, but¦34503 my¦34505 teachings will never become irrelevant.
\s1 Stay alert for the coming of the master
\r (Mat. 24:36-44)
\p
\v 32 \x + \xo 13:32: \xt Mat 24:36.\x* But as for the date or time when all this will happen, only the father¦34535 knows that—even the son and messengers¦34523 don't¦34521 know.
\v 33 So watch out, observe current events, and¦34540 be praying¦34541, because¦34544 you¦34543 won't know exactly when all this will happen.
\v 34 \x + \xo 13:34: \xt Luk 12:36-38.\x*It can all be compared to a man¦34559 who was about to leave his house¦34564 and go on a trip. Before he leaves, he gives certain jobs and responsibilities to his various slaves¦34570, and instructs his security guard to stay alert.
\v 35 So you all watch¦34587 and stay alert, because¦34591 you don't¦34589 know when the master¦34594 of the house¦34596 might return—perhaps one evening¦34599 or at midnight¦34602, or at dawn or maybe mid-morning.
\v 36 You certainly don't want to be caught napping when he¦34613 comes.
\v 37 And what I'm telling you¦34620 now, I tell everyone: stay alert and watch¦34625.”

\s1 The leaders plan to eliminate Yeshua
\r (Mat. 26:1-5; Luk. 22:1-2; Jn 11:45-53)
\p
\v 1 \x + \xo 14:1: \xt Exo 12:1-27.\x*Now it was two¦34634 days¦34635 before the Passover Feast and the Feast of Flat Bread, and the chief¦34639 priests¦34639 and the religious¦34643 teachers¦34643 were trying to figure out how they could have Yeshua set up so they could arrest him and have him executed,
\v 2 but they¦34652 knew that the Feast wouldn't be a good time because the people¦34665 would protest in Yeshua's favour.
\s1 The woman anoints Yeshua for his burial
\r (Mat. 26:6-13; Jn 12:1-8)
\p
\v 3 \x + \xo 14:3: \xt Luk 7:37-38.\x*Meanwhile, Yeshua was in Bethany¦34672 at the home who Simon¦34676 who had previously had leprosy¦34678. Yeshua was sitting¦34679 there when a woman¦34682 came¦34681 in with a hand-crafted container of very expensive¦34690 fragrant oil. Breaking open the sealed flask, she¦34700 poured¦34700 the fragrant oil over Yeshua's head.
\v 4 Immediately some started quietly grumbling about the extravagant waste,
\v 5 then they¦34749 scolded the woman because¦34740 a flask of genuine lotion like this could easily fetch almost a year's wages if it was sold.
\p
\v 6 But Yeshua¦34755 spoke up, “What do you think you're doing abusing her—leave her alone! She's done something very good¦34765 for me.
\v 7 \x + \xo 14:7: \xt Deu 15:11.\x*You'll always have poor people around, and you can help them whenever¦34782 you want to, but I won't be around forever.
\v 8 She has performed the traditional anointing¦34803 of my body¦34806 in advance of my burial¦34810.
\v 9 And I can assure you¦34814 that wherever¦34816 the good¦34821 news is proclaimed¦34819 around the world¦34826, what she has done today will be part of the story and she'll be remembered.
\s1 Judas offers to hand Yeshua over
\r (Mat. 26:14-16; Luk. 22:3-6)
\p
\v 10 Then Judas Iscariot, one of the Yeshua's twelve¦34847 \add trainees\add*, visited the chief¦34851 priests¦34851 to offer to hand Yeshua over to them.
\v 11 When they heard¦34862 this, they were very pleased and promised¦34866 to pay him well, and Judas asked them about the most convenient¦34876 way for them to get hold of Yeshua.
\s1 Yeshua's trainees prepare the Passover meal
\r (Mat. 26:17-25; Luk. 22:7-14, 21-23)
\p
\v 12 On the first¦34881 day¦34882 of the Feast of Flat Bread when the lambs would be slaughtered ready for the special Passover meal, Yeshua's trainees asked him, “Where¦34894 do you want us to get everything ready for our Passover meal?”
\p
\v 13 So Yeshua sent off two¦34906 of them with these instructions, “Go into town and a man¦34927 carrying a pitcher¦34928 of water¦34929 will meet you there. Just follow¦34931 him
\v 14 until he goes into a house. Then find the owner¦34940 of the house and tell him that the teacher¦34943 wants to know the location of the guestroom¦34948 where¦34934 he and his trainees can celebrate the Passover meal.
\v 15 He'll show you a large¦34968, furnished¦34969 room upstairs¦34965—that's where you can get everything ready¦34971.
\p
\v 16 So the two of them went off into the town, and everything happened there exactly as Yeshua had told them, and so they prepared¦34995 the special meal there.
\s1 Yeshua shocks his trainees at the Passover meal
\r (Mat. 26:20-30; Luk. 22:14-23; Jn 13:21-30; 1 Kur. 11:23-25)
\p
\v 17 As the evening¦34999 approached, Yeshua went in for dinner with his twelve¦35006 trainees.
\v 18 \x + \xo 14:18: \xt Psa 41:9.\x*As they were sitting¦35008 around eating, he told them, “I will tell you frankly that one of you eating with me here will hand me over \add to be arrested\add*.”
\v 19 That upset them, and¦35038 several of them individually asked, “Surely¦35045 it couldn't be me?”
\p
\v 20 Then he continued, “It's one of the twelve¦35062—the one who dips his bread in the sauce at the same time as me.
\v 21 Indeed it's written¦35085 \add in the scriptures\add* that humankind's child will be arrested, but on the other¦35090 hand, what a tragedy it will be for the one who hands him over—in fact it would be better¦35101 for that man if he was never born.”
\p
\v 22 As the carried on eating¦35112, he took a bread roll, blessed¦35118 \add God\add*, broke¦35121 the roll apart and gave a piece to them, saying, “Take this bread—it's my¦35136 body¦35135.”
\p
\v 23 Then he picked up a cup, gave¦35142 thanks¦35141 \add to God\add*, and passed it around so they could each drink from it,
\v 24 \x + \xo 14:24: a \xt Exo 24:8; \xo b \xt Jer 31:31-34.\x*saying, “This is the blood¦35157 of my¦35158 contract that will be poured¦35167 out for many \add people\add*.
\v 25 I can assure you that I won't drink anything made from grapes until¦35189 I drink new juice in God's kingdom¦35199.”
\p
\v 26 And after they'd sung some songs, they left¦35204 the town and went across to the Mount¦35207 of Olives¦35209.

\p
\v 27 \x + \xo 14:27: \xt Zech 13:7.\x*Then Yeshua¦35215 continued his teaching, “All of you¦35219 will stumble¦35219 because¦35228 it's written¦35229 in the scriptures: ‘I will strike¦35230 down the shepherd¦35232 and¦35233 the sheep¦35237 will be scattered¦35239.’

\v 29 But Peter contradicted him¦35259, “Even if everyone else stumbles¦35265, I won't!”
\p
\v 30 And Yeshua¦35276 responded, “I can assure you that you'll renounce¦35297 me three¦35293 times¦35293 this very night¦35286, before¦35288 the rooster¦35291 crows early tomorrow morning.”
\p
\v 31 But Peter argued forcibly, “Even if I had to die¦35317 with you, I would never disown you!”
\p And all the others said similar things.
\s1 Yeshua, in distress, prays at Gethsemane
\r (Mat. 26:36-46; Luk. 22:39-46)
\p
\v 32 They walked along until¦35348 they came to a piece of land called Gethsemane¦35339 where Yeshua told his¦35344 trainees to sit down while he prayed.
\v 33 He took Peter and Jacob¦35357 and John¦35360 further in with him¦35362 where he¦35352 stared off in a daze but was obviously very distressed¦35368.
\v 34 He told the three of them, “My¦35377 soul¦35376 is deathly¦35379 sad! You guys just stay here and¦35382 keep alert.”
\p
\v 35 He went ahead a little¦35387 way where he knelt on the ground¦35395 with his head down and prayed¦35398—asking if it was possible¦35401 to avoid what was ahead of him.
\v 36 But he¦35412 said, “Father, I know that you can do anything. Let me avoid this suffering, but yes I know, it doesn't matter what I want¦35442 but what you've \add planned\add*.”
\p
\v 37 Then he went back and found the others sleeping. He asked Peter, “Simon¦35454, are you asleep? Couldn't you stay awake even for a single hour¦35460?
\v 38 You all need to stay alert and be careful not to give into temptation¦35470. I know your spirits¦35473 are enthusiastic on one hand, but it's still easy to give in to the moment.”
\p
\v 39 Then he went further in again¦35480 and prayed¦35482 as before,
\v 40 but when he returned again¦35488, he found¦35491 them all asleep because¦35496 they were tired, but they couldn't really find any excuse to give.
\p
\v 41 The third¦35515 time that Yeshua returned, he said to them, “Ah, you're all sleeping¦35519 again and having a good rest. It's well earned but the time has come for humankind's child to be handed over to evil men.
\v 42 Come on—get up—we¦35545 need to go! Look, the one who'll hand me over is on his way.
\s1 Yeshua is arrested in the night
\r (Mat. 26:47-56; Luk. 22:47-53; Jn 18:3-12)
\p
\v 43 Even while Yeshua was still¦35557 speaking¦35559, Judas reached him, followed by a crowd¦35573 from the the chief¦35582 priests¦35582, and the religious¦35586 teachers¦35586, and the elders¦35589—many armed with swords¦35576 and clubs¦35578.
\v 44 Judas had prearranged a signal¦35597 with them that whoever he greeted with a kiss¦35603, they should grab that person and lead him away under guard.
\p
\v 45 So he walked right up to Yeshua and said, “My honoured teacher,” and greeted him with a kiss.
\v 46 Then the others with him grabbed Yeshua and secured him.
\v 47 But one of the ones with Yeshua that was beside him¦35665, drew his¦35665 sword¦35654 and¦35663 struck¦35657 a slave¦35660 of the chief¦35662 priest¦35662, cutting off the man's ear¦35667.
\v 48 Yeshua¦35673 spoke to the crowd, “Did you all bring swords¦35682 and¦35683 clubs¦35684 to try to capture¦35685 me like you'd chase down a thief?
\v 49 \x + \xo 14:49: \xt Luk 19:47; 21:37.\x*I was standing there teaching¦35695 in the temple¦35694 every¦35687 day¦35688 and you could have arrested me, but it's happened this way to ensure that the what's written in scriptures¦35705 will be fulfilled¦35703.
\p
\v 50 Meanwhile, the ones with Yeshua had taken off.
\v 51 One young¦35721 fellow was wearing a single linen¦35730 robe, and when the crowd tried to grab him,
\v 52 it came off \add in the struggle\add* and he ran away stark naked¦35747.
\s1 The mock trial where Yeshua is sentenced to death
\r (Mat. 26:57-68; Luk. 22:54-55,63-71; Jn 18:13-14,19-24)
\p
\v 53 The guards led Yeshua¦35754 away to the chief priest's residence, and all the chief priests¦35767 and the elders¦35772 and the religious¦35776 teachers¦35776 gathered there also.
\v 54 Peter¦35779 followed¦35782 along from a distance and went in as far as the courtyard¦35789 of the residence where he joined the servants who were sitting¦35795 around the fire¦35804 keeping warm.
\v 55 Inside, the chief¦35807 priests¦35807 and all the council¦35811 were trying to establish a case against¦35813 Yeshua¦35815 so he could be sentenced to death¦35821, but they weren't coming up with anything.
\v 56 Several were making up charges against¦35832 him¦35833, but¦35834 none of the accusers' stories agreed with each other.
\p
\v 57 Eventually some of them stood¦35843 up and offered this false¦35844 charge:
\v 58 \x + \xo 14:58: \xt Jn 2:19.\x*“We heard¦35852 him¦35853 say that he would demolish this temple¦35861 made by many labourers, and within three¦35867 days¦35868 he'd build¦35872 another¦35869 one without any helpers.”
\v 59 But even then, they couldn't get their¦35881 accusations to align with each other.
\p
\v 60 Nevertheless the chief¦35885 priest¦35885 in the middle of the council stood¦35883 up and asked¦35889 Yeshua¦35891, “Aren't you going to defend yourself? These men¦35898 are accusing you of these¦35898 things.”
\p
\v 61 But Yeshua didn't say anything. So the chief¦35917 priest¦35917 asked again, “Is it true that you're the chosen¦35931 one that God promised to send—the son of the blessed¦35937 \add God\add*?”
\p
\v 62 \x + \xo 14:62: \xt Dan 7:13.\x*Yeshua¦35941 replied, “I am. And you¦35949 will all see humankind's child sitting¦35957 in the honoured postion by the powerful¦35959 God and coming¦35961 through the clouds¦35965 in the sky¦35968.”
\p
\v 63 Then the chief¦35971 priest¦35971 tore his own robe \add to show his disgust\add* and shouted, “We certainly don't need any more witnesses¦35983 now!
\v 64 \x + \xo 14:64: \xt Lev 24:16.\x*You yourselves all heard¦35986 him¦36006 insult God. What sentence does that deserve?”
\p So the leaders there agreed that Yeshua needed to be sentenced to death¦36011.
\p
\v 65 Then various people started spitting¦36015 on him, and blindfolding¦36018 him and beating¦36026 him saying¦36030, “Ha, tell us who that was!” Even the servants joined in to slap him.
\s1 The pegpahunware of Pidru concerning of Yeshua
\r (Mat. 26:69-75; Luk. 22:56-62; Jn 18:15-18,25-27)
\p
\v 66 Meanwhile, Peter was down in the courtyard¦36057 when one of the chief¦36067 priest's¦36067 servant¦36064 girl came out,
\v 67 and seeing Peter warming¦36072 himself¦36072, she¦36076 looked more closely and said, “Hey, you were with that Yeshua¦36090 from Nazareth¦36084!”
\p
\v 68 But he denied it, “I don't know him and I don't know why you think I would!” And he moved away from the fire.
\p
\v 69 But the girl¦36122 that had seen¦36123 him¦36124 said to some of the others standing around, “That guy's one of them.”
\p
\v 70 But again Peter denied it.
\p A little¦36153 while later, some of those standing there said, “You must be one of them because¦36167 you're¦36165 from Galilee¦36168.”
\p
\v 71 Now Peter started swearing¦36182 and cursing¦36178 and said, “I've never even met that fellow that you're all talking¦36190 about!”
\p
\v 72 And right then the rooster crowed¦36197 for the second¦36195 time¦36195. Peter remembered now what Yeshua had told him—how he would renounce¦36225 Yeshua three¦36223 times¦36223 before the rooster crows—and he broke¦36228 down and cried.
\c 15
\s1 Pilate tries to interrogate Yeshua
\r (Mat. 27:1-2,11-14; Luk. 23:1-5; Jn 18:28-38)
\p
\v 1 First thing in the morning¦36237, the chief¦36243 priests¦36243 called a meeting with the elders¦36246 and the religious¦36250 teachers¦36250 and all the council¦36255, and they ordered that Yeshua¦36259 be tied up and taken over to Governor Pilate¦36269.
\v 2 There Pilate¦36274 asked¦36271 him, “Are you the king¦36279 of the Jews¦36281?”
\p “You said it¦36290,” replied Yeshua.
\p
\v 3 Then the chief¦36296 priests¦36296 started hurling accusations¦36292 against¦36294 Yeshua.
\v 4 So Pilate¦36304 asked¦36306 him¦36308 again, “Don't you have anything to say? Listen to all these accusations¦36318 they're making against you.”
\p
\v 5 But Pilate¦36329 was astounded that Yeshua¦36322 didn't answer¦36325 any further.
\s1 Pilate agrees to execute an innocent man
\r (Mat. 27:15-26; Luk. 23:13-25; Jn 18:39–19:16)
\p
\v 6 Now at time of the Jewish Passover, Pilate would normally pardon one prisoner¦36341 for them and release him.
\v 7 There was another prisoner at the time named Barabbas¦36353 who was an activist accused of murder¦36363.
\v 8 By now, the crowd¦36372 had arrived and asked Pilate to release a prisoner as usual at Passover.
\v 9 So he asked them, “Do you want me to release the King of the Jews¦36395 for you?”
\v 10 This was because Pilate was well aware that the chief¦36408 priests¦36408 had brought Yeshua because they were jealous of his \add popularity\add*.
\v 11 But the chief¦36411 priests¦36411 stirred¦36413 up the crowd¦36416 to start saying that it was Barabbas¦36422 that they wanted released.
\v 12 So Pilate¦36427 asked again¦36428, “Then what should I do with this man that you¦36439 call the King of the Jews¦36444?”
\p
\v 13 The crowd yelled¦36448 back, “Execute¦36451 him¦36452 on a pole.”
\p
\v 14 Pilate¦36455 demanded, “What has he¦36461 even done wrong?”
\p But they¦36463 just yelled¦36467 louder, “Execute¦36470 him¦36471 on a pole!”
\p
\v 15 Now Pilate¦36474 wanted to placate the crowd¦36477, so he had Barabbas¦36488 released while he had Yeshua¦36494 flogged¦36495 and then handed over to the execution¦36499 squad.
\s1 The battalion plays with their mock “king”
\r (Mat. 27:27-31; Jn 19:2-3)
\p
\v 16 So the soldiers¦36502 led Yeshua inside the palace¦36509 that was the governor's¦36513 residence¦36513, and¦36514 called in the rest of the battalion.
\v 17 They \add mocked Yeshua\add* by dressing¦36521 him in a kingly robe, and after someone twisted¦36529 some thorns¦36530 together¦36529 into a mock crown¦36531, they pressed it onto his head,
\v 18 and¦36532 began¦36533 saluting him¦36535, “Greetings¦36538, King of the Jews¦36543.”
\v 19 They took turns whacking his¦36546 head with a stick and spitting¦36555 on him, while others knelt down in front of him and pretended to be bowing to him.
\v 20 After they'd finished having fun mocked¦36566 him, they took the purple¦36571 robe off him, and put his¦36578 own robe back on him. Then they led him outside towards the execution¦36586 spot.
\s1 Yeshua is publicly executed along with thieves
\r (Mat. 27:32-44; Luk. 23:26-43; Jn 19:17-27)
\p
\v 21 \x + \xo 15:21: \xt Rom 16:13.\x*As they walked out of the city, they came across a man¦36593 coming¦36599 in from the country¦36602. He was Simon¦36595 from Cyrene, the father¦36604 of Alexander¦36605 and Rufus, and the soldiers forced him¦36612 to carry¦36609 the execution pole,
\v 22 and so they¦36615 all arrived at Golgotha¦36621 (which¦36623 means “Place¦36628 of the skull¦36628”).
\v 23 There the soliders went to give some spiced wine to Yeshua, but¦36640 he¦36642 declined it.
\v 24 \x + \xo 15:24: \xt Psa 22:18.\x*So they¦36648 carried out the execution¦36644, taking Yeshua's clothes¦36651 and¦36658 drawing straws to see who would get what.
\v 25 By now it¦36661 was 9am, and¦36666 they¦36668 affixed Yeshua to the pole.
\v 26 The charge¦36676 had been written out and attached \add at the top\add*: “The King of the Jews¦36684.”
\v 27 That morning, two¦36691 thieves were also executed¦36688 there—one on each side of Yeshua.
\p
\v 28 ≈
\v 29 \x + \xo 15:29: a \xt Psa 22:7; 109:25; \xo b \xt Mrk 14:58; Jn 2:19.\x*As people passed by on the path, they insulted Yeshua, shaking¦36719 their¦36722 heads¦36721 and shouting, “Hoy there! You who reckoned you¦36727 could demolish the temple¦36730 and rebuild it¦36732 in three¦36734 days¦36735.
\v 30 Come down from that pole and save¦36737 yourself¦36738.”
\p
\v 31 Similarly¦36745 the chief¦36749 priests¦36749 and the religious¦36756 teachers¦36756 laughed together and mocked, “He did miracles for others¦36758, but he can't even save¦36763 himself¦36760.
\v 32 The so-called ‘chosen¦36765 one’ or ‘King of Israel’. Now, if he'd just come¦36770 down from there, then we'd be able to believe¦36779 him.”
\p Even the other two being executed¦36783 with him were deriding¦36786 him.
\s1 Yeshua breathes his last
\r (Mat. 27:45-56; Luk. 23:44-49; Jn 19:28-30)
\p
\v 33 At noon, it got dark everywhere, until¦36802 3pm,
\v 34 \x + \xo 15:34: \xt Psa 22:1.\x*when Yeshua¦36814 shouted¦36812 loudly¦36816, “My¦36831 God, my¦36831 God, why have you¦36838 abandoned¦36838 me?”
\p
\v 35 Some of the people standing nearby thought he was calling¦36854 the prophet Elijah.
\v 36 \x + \xo 15:36: \xt Psa 69:21.\x*One of them ran, and soaked a sponge¦36864 in some sour wine, then put it on a stick and held it up for Yeshua to drink¦36870, saying¦36872, “Hang on. Let's see¦36876 if Elijah does come to get him down.”
\p
\v 37 But just then Yeshua¦36884 uttered a loud¦36887 cry¦36886 and exhaled his last breath.
\p
\v 38 \x + \xo 15:38: \xt Exo 26:31-33.\x*(Back in the temple¦36893, the curtain¦36891 tore down the middle from the top to the bottom¦36902.)
\v 39 The Roman centurion¦36906 who had been standing back watching everything, said¦36922 when Yeshua died, “This man¦36926 was definitely God's son.”
\p
\v 40 \x + \xo 15:40-41: \xt Luk 8:2-3.\x*Further back, there was also a group of women¦36937 observing¦36940 everything. These included Maria from Magdala¦36948, Maria the mother¦36960 of young Jacob¦36953 and Joses, and Salome,
\v 41 and others who had followed¦36970 Yeshua around Galilee¦36969 and helped look after¦36972 him, along with many others who had come¦36982 down with him to Jerusalem¦36985.
\s1 Joseph boldly lays the body in a burial chamber
\r (Mat. 27:57-61; Luk. 23:50-56; Jn 19:38-42)
\p
\v 42 As evening¦36988 came, it was now the Preparation Day, i.e., the day before the Rest Day.
\v 43 Joseph¦37003 (who'd come¦37001 from the city of Arimathea¦37006 and one who was waiting¦37015 for the coming of God's¦37025 kingdom¦37017), a prominent¦37008 council¦37009 member¦37009, steeled himself¦37013 up and went in to see the governor to get permission to transfer Yeshua's¦37032 body¦37030.
\v 44 Governor Pilate¦37035 didn't think he'd be dead yet, so he called¦37044 an army commander to find out if Yeshua had indeed died.
\v 45 As soon as he found out, he gave Joseph¦37069 permission.
\v 46 So Joseph \add and his companions\add* went and bought¦37074 some linen burial cloth and then, removing Yeshua's body from the pole, wrapped¦37082 it in the cloth and placed it in a burial chamber that had been chiseled into a rockface. Then they rolled¦37105 a rock¦37103 across the opening.
\v 47 Others were watching and noted where¦37134 the body had been laid, including Maria from Magdala¦37120 and Maria the mother¦37123 of Joses.
\c 16
\s1 The massive shock at the burial chamber
\r (Mat. 28:1-8; Luk. 24:1-12; Jn 20:1-10)
\p
\v 1 After the Rest Day was over, Maria from Magdala¦37145 and Maria the mother¦37148 of Jacob¦37150 and Salome, went and bought¦37154 some traditional burial spices¦37155 that evening to take to the burial chamber and place with the body.
\v 2 Then very early¦37165 on Sunday morning they¦37173 went to the chamber, arriving just as the sun¦37182 was rising.
\v 3 But they realised that they didn't have anyone with them to roll the rock away that was covering the entrance.
\v 4 However, when they looked¦37205 they saw that the very large¦37217 rock had already been rolled¦37209 away.
\v 5 So they went on into the burial chamber and were toally stunned to find a young¦37235 man¦37235 dressed in white¦37243, sitting¦37237 in there on the side.
\p
\v 6 He assured them, “Don't be surprised. I know you're looking¦37263 for¦37263 Yeshua¦37262 from Nazareth¦37265, the one who was executed¦37268 on a pole. But see¦37273 there where¦37281 his body was—he's not there because he came back to life.
\v 7 \x + \xo 16:7: \xt Mat 26:32; Mrk 14:28.\x*So you three should go and tell his¦37290 trainees, and Peter in particular, that he's going to go up ahead of them to Galilee¦37301 and you'll all see him up there¦37302, just as he already told you.”
\p
\v 8 So they left the chamber and took off running, still stunned and shaking and too scared to stop and to talk to anyone.
\rem It's not certain whether or not the following longer ending of this document was actually penned by Mark, or whether it was appended slightly later. Expert scholars are divided on this, and hence it's included here for your consideration:
\s1 \add The others don't believe that Maria saw Yeshua\add*
\r (Mat. 28:9-10; Jn 20:11-18)
\v 9 \add After coming back to life early on Sunday morning, Yeshua appeared first to Maria from Magdala. (She was the one that he had once commanded seven demons to leave.)\add*
\v 10 \add After leaving him, she went and told his followers who were mourning and weeping at his loss.\add*
\v 11 \add But when she told them that he is alive again and that she'd seen him, they simply didn't believe her.\add*
\s1 \add Yeshua appears to two of his followers\add*
\r (Luk. 24:13-35)
\p
\v 12 \add Later on, Yeshua appeared in a different form to two of his followers on the path as they left Jerusalem and headed out to the countryside,\add*
\v 13 \add but when they hurried back and told the others, no one believed them.\add*
\s1 \add Yeshua appears to his trainees and instructs them\add*
\r (Mat. 28:16-20; Luk. 24:36-49; Jn 20:19-23; Acts 1:6-8)
\p
\v 14 \add Later again when the eleven trainees were sitting around eating, Yeshua appeared in the room and scolded them for not believing and for being so stubborn when they hadn't believed others who had told them that he'd come back from the dead.\add*
\v 15 \x + \xo 16:15: \xt Acts 1:8.\x*\add Then he instructed them, “Travel around all the world and tell the good news to everyone.\add*
\v 16 \add Anyone who believes and gets immersed in water will be saved, however, those who refuse to believe will be condemned to death.\add*
\v 17 \add Those who believe will be able to do miracles: they'll be able to use my authority to command demons to leave and to speak new languages,\add*
\v 18 \add and they'll be able to pick up snakes. If they drink anything poisonous, it won't hurt them, and they will place their hands on people and make them better.\add*
\s1 \add Yeshua is lifted up to heaven\add*
\r (Luk. 24:50-53; Acts 1:9-11)
\p
\v 19 \x + \xo 16:19: \xt Acts 1:9-11.\x*\add When Yeshua had finished speaking, he was lifted up into heaven and seated in the honoured place next to God.\add*
\v 20 \add Then his followers went around preaching everywhere, and God worked through them and so they were able to confirm the truth of their preaching by doing miracles.\add*
