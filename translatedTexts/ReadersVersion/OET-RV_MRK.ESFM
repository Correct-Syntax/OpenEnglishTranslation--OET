\mt2 The account of Jesus' ministry by
\mt1 Mark
\is1 Introduction
\is2 Author
\ip This account about the works and teachings of Jesus was written by Mark, the son of a Jewish family who lived in Jerusalem. His mother was named Mary (<a href="ACT.html#C12V12">Acts 12:12</a>).
\ip Many people think he was John Mark, a cousin of Barnabas (<a href="COL.html#C4V10">Col. 4:10</a>) who accompanied Paul on his first long-distance trip to spread the good news about Jesus the messiah (<a href="ACT.html#C12V25">Acts 12:25</a>, <a href="ACT.html#C13V13">13:13</a>). We also know that Mark accompanied Peter (<a href="PE1.html#C5V13">1 Peter 5:13</a>), and some consider that it might have been Peter who narrated to Mark what Jesus had done and taught.
\is2 This account
\ip This account seems to have been written for non-Jews, especially perhaps those familiar with Roman customs. So he didn't use as much ink as Matthew or Luke explaining prophecies from the Jewish scriptures but he does however, take time to explain Jewish customs to help non-Jewish readers.
\ip Mark explains here that Jesus came to serve both God and the people, and he often refers to him as ‘mankind's child’ (traditionally translated very literally from the Greek as the ‘Son of Man’). We can see that especially in <a href="#C10V45">10:45</a>: “Even mankind's child didn't come to be served, but to serve others and to give his life as a ransom to set many people free.” Mark wants his readers to know that Jesus did incredible things, but especially focuses on his teaching. He confirms the power and authority of Jesus by telling about the miracles that he did, his healing of the sick, and his exorcism of demons.
\ip The ending of this account is often disputed, and scholars are still <a href="https://textandcanon.org/a-case-for-the-longer-ending-of-mark">debating</a> about whether or not the longer ending (<a href="#C16V9">16:9-20</a>) is original. The \em OET\em* includes the disputed longer ending, but displays it in a lighter colour to indicate its debatable status.

\v 1 Here begins the good¦21753 news about Jesus¦21754 the messiah—the son of god:
\s1 The ministry of John the immerser (The return of ‘Elijah’)
\r (Mat. 3:1-12; Luk. 3:1-18; Jhn. 1:19-28)
\p
\v 2 \x + \xo 1:2: \xt Mal 3:1.\x*The prophet Isaiah wrote:
\q1 “See, I am sending¦21774 my messenger to you,
\q1 the one who will be preparing your path.
\q1
\v 3 \x + \xo 1:3: \xt Isa 40:3 (LXX).\x*The voice out in the wilderness shouting,
\q2 ‘Get the path ready for the master;
\q2 Make it smooth for him¦21803 to travel on.’ ”
\p
\v 4 John turned up in the wilderness announcing that people should get immersed in water in order to show that their sins¦21893 have been forgiven.
\v 5 And many from the Judean region and from the city of Jerusalem went out to hear him, and they confessed their sins¦21919 and asked John to immerse them in the Jordan river.
\p
\v 6 \x + \xo 1:6: \xt 2Ki 1:8.\x*John was dressed in simple clothes made from camel¦21929 hair with a leather belt around his waist, and he lived on locusts¦21941 and wild honey¦21943.
\v 7 And he also announced, “There's a greater man coming¦21956 soon—in fact I'm not even good enough to bend down and untie his sandals.
\v 8 I immersed¦21981 you in water, but he will immerse you all in God's pure spirit.”
\s1 Jesus gets immersed and then tempted
\r (Mat. 3:13–4:11; Luk. 3:21-22; 4:1-13)
\p
\v 9 Then one day Jesus came from Nazareth in the Galilee region, and he was immersed in the Jordan river by John.
\v 10 As Jesus came up out of the water, he saw¦22030 the sky being opened up, and God's spirit¦22037 coming¦22045 down on him like a dove.
\v 11 \x + \xo 1:11: \xt Gen 22:2; Psa 2:7; Isa 42:1; Mat 3:17; 12:18; Mrk 9:7; Luk 3:22.\x*And a voice came¦22054 from the sky saying, “You are my son who I love and am pleased with.”
\p
\v 12 And then the spirit¦22076 sent him¦22079 into the wilderness
\v 13 where he was tested by Satan for forty¦22092 days¦22093. He was out there with the wild animals, but angels¦22106 waited on him there.
\s1 The selection of the first followers / apprentices
\r (Mat. 4:12-22; Luk. 4:14-15; 5:1-11)
\p
\v 14 After John had been arrested, Jesus went back up to Galilee, announcing the good¦22125 news from God
\v 15 \x + \xo 1:15: \xt Mat 3:2.\x*saying, “The promised time¦22137 is here, and God's kingdom¦22142 is now near, so turn from your sins and believe this good¦22152 news.”
\p
\v 16 And as he went around the lake of Galilee, Jesus saw¦22162 Simon and his brother¦22168 Andrew throwing¦22172 a net¦22172 into the lake because they were fishermen.
\v 17 And he said¦22186 to them, “Come with me and¦22193 I will be making you¦22195 fishermen of people¦22199.”
\v 18 And so they¦22208 left their¦22205 fishing and went off with Jesus.
\p
\v 19 Then a bit further on he saw¦22216 Jacob Zebedee and his brother¦22224 John with him in a boat¦22230 getting their nets¦22233 ready.
\v 20 Jesus called them and they¦22256 too went¦22256 off with him, leaving their father¦22243 Zebedee in the boat¦22249 with the hired workers.
\s1 Jesus drives out a demon
\r (Luk. 4:31-37)
\p
\v 21 They went on into Capernaum where he went into the meeting hall and began teaching as soon as the Sabbath started.
\v 22 \x + \xo 1:22: \xt Mat 7:28-29.\x*The congregation was amazed at his teaching, because he taught with authority, not like the regular teachers there.
\p
\v 23 Then a demon-possessed man¦22308 in the meeting hall suddenly yelled out,
\v 24 “What are we to you, Jesus of Nazareth? You've come to destroy us. I know that you're God's holy one.”
\p
\v 25 But Jesus scolded it, “Keep quiet!”, and, “Come out of him!”
\p
\v 26 Then the demon threw the man into a convulsion, cried out loudly, and left him.
\v 27 Everyone was astounded and asked each other, “What just happened? We haven't heard this before—he has authority¦22408 to command demons, and they obey him!”
\p
\v 28 And the news about Jesus spread all over the entire region of Galilee.
\s1 Jesus heals many others
\r (Mat. 8:14-17; Luk. 4:38-41)
\p
\v 29 After leaving the meeting hall, Jesus went into the home of Simon and Andrew, along with Jacob and John.
\v 30 Inside, Simon's mother-in-law was lying down with a fever, and the others spoke to Jesus about her.
\v 31 He went up to her, took hold of her hand¦22484, and helped her up. Then the fever subsided and she¦22500 prepared something for them to eat.
\p
\v 32 That evening when the sun¦22511 set, the people brought all those who were sick or demon-possessed to Jesus.
\v 33 It seemed like the entire town had gathered¦22531 there outside the front door¦22537.
\v 34 Jesus healed¦22561 many who were sick from a range of diseases, and he commanded many demons to leave—not allowing them to speak because they knew that he was the messiah.
\s1 Jesus prays before going preaching
\r (Luk. 4:42-44)
\p
\v 35 In the small hours of the morning, Jesus got up and went¦22596 out to a quiet place¦22600 and prayed there.
\v 36 But Simon¦22613 and the others came looking for him,
\v 37 and when they found him they said, “Everyone's looking for you!”
\p
\v 38 And Jesus answered, “Well, we'll be going¦22637 into the other villages around here, so that I can also tell them. That's what I came¦22662 here for.”
\v 39 \x + \xo 1:39: \xt Mat 4:23; 9:35.\x*Then he went preaching in all their meeting halls in Galilee¦22679 and driving out demons.
\s1 Jesus heals a man with leprosy
\r (Mat. 8:1-4; Luk. 5:12-16)
\p
\v 40 A man with leprosy came to Jesus asking him, “I know that you could heal me if you wanted to.”
\p
\v 41 Jesus felt compassion for him, reached out his hand¦22715 and touched him, and said, “Yes, I will. Get well.”
\v 42 Then immediately¦22729 the leprosy disappeared and he was well again.
\v 43 So Jesus sent¦22746 him away, but warned him:
\v 44 \x + \xo 1:44: \xt Lev 14:1-32.\x*“Don't talk to anyone—just go to the priest¦22764 and show him¦22751 that you're well, and as a testimony of that, make the offering that Moses commanded.”
\p
\v 45 But after the man left, he started telling lots of people and spreading the news—so much so that Jesus could no longer come into the town but had to stay out in quieter places¦22809, and people kept coming¦22812 to him.
\c 2
\s1 Jesus heals a paralysed man
\r (Mat. 9:1-8; Luk. 5:17-26)
\p
\v 1 When Jesus came back to Capernaum after a few days¦22826, people soon heard that he was back in the house¦22832.
\v 2 And so many people turned up there that there wasn't any room left—not even in the doorway. Inside, Jesus was explaining the Scriptures to them.
\v 3 Four men arrived, carrying a paralysed man to Jesus,
\v 4 but because of the crowd, they were unable to get close. So they climbed up onto the flat roof, made a hole through it, and lowered the paralysed man lying on a pallet.
\v 5 Jesus, observing their faith¦22913, said to the man, “Son, your sins¦22927 are forgiven!”
\p
\v 6 But some of the religious teachers were sitting there, thinking to themselves,
\v 7 “Why's he talking like that? He's seriously insulting God. There's only one who can forgive sins¦22955, and that's God himself.”
\p
\v 8 Then Jesus, knowing in his spirit¦22969 that they¦22975 are thinking like that, said to them, “Why are you thinking that to yourselves?
\v 9 Which is easier: to tell the paralysed man that his sins¦23003 have been forgiven, or to tell him to pick up his bedding and walk?”
\v 10 But so you all can see that mankind's child \em does\em* have authority¦23034 here on the earth to forgive sins¦23047, he turned and said to the paralysed man,
\v 11 “Listen. Get up, take your bedding, and¦23062 go home¦23066!”
\p
\v 12 So the man stood up, and picked up his bedding, and went out of the house where everyone saw¦23106 him and marvelled and praised God saying, “We've never seen anything happen like this before!”
\s1 The calling of Levi (Matthew)
\r (Mat. 9:9-13; Luk. 5:27-32)
\p
\v 13 Jesus went out beside the lake where crowds of people kept coming¦23125 to him and he taught them.
\v 14 And as he was passing by the tax office, he saw¦23134 Levi Alphaeus sitting there and said to him, “Come along with me.” So Levi stood up and followed¦23154 Jesus.
\p
\v 15 Jesus ended up having a meal at Levi's place, and many other tax collectors and undesirables were sitting there also, along with Jesus' followers, because by then many were following¦23189 him around.
\v 16 And the teachers from the Pharisee party noticed that Jesus was eating beside undesirables and tax collectors. So they asked his followers, “How come he eats with tax collectors and other low-life?”
\p
\v 17 And overhearing them, Jesus said, “Healthy people don't need a doctor—it's the sick ones that do. I didn't come here to help those who think they have no needs, but to call sinners.”
\s1 The question of fasting
\r (Mat. 9:14-17; Luk. 5:33-39)
\p
\v 18 Now the followers of John-the-Immerser and members of the Pharisees regularly fasted. So a small group came to Jesus and asked, “How come John's followers and the Pharisee party fast regularly, yet your¦23297 followers don't?”
\p
\v 19 And Jesus answered, “Can the friends of the groom fast when they're celebrating along with him? No, as long as he's still there, they won't be fasting.
\v 20 But in the future, the groom will be taken away from them, and¦23345 \em then\em* they'll be fasting.
\p
\v 21 “No one sews a patch of new, unshrunken cloth onto an old garment, because the new patch will tear away from that old fabric and it¦23378 will end up as a worse tear.
\v 22 And no one puts new wine into old wineskins, because the wine will burst the \add already stretched\add* wineskins, and then both the wine and the wineskins will be destroyed. New wine must be put into \em new\em* wineskins.”
\s1 Working on the Rest Day
\r (Mat. 12:1-8; Luk. 6:1-5)
\p
\v 23 \x + \xo 2:23: \xt Deu 23:25.\x*And it so happened that Jesus and his followers passed through some fields¦23453 of grain on some days¦23445 of rest. As they went through, they plucked off some heads of grain.
\v 24 And some members of the Pharisee party said, “It's breaking the law to harvest grain on a rest day!”
\p
\v 25 And Jesus replied, “You've read yourselves what David did when him¦23514 and his men were hungry.
\v 26 \x + \xo 2:26: \xt Lev 24:9.\x*They went into God's tent and ate the holy bread¦23531 representing the presence of God. Only the priests¦23553 were allowed to eat that, and yet David even gave¦23555 some to his men!”
\v 27 And he told the Pharisees, “The days of rest were created for people, not people for the rest days.
\v 28 So I¦23588, mankind's child, have authority also over the day¦23591 of rest.”
\c 3
\s1 The man with the curled-up hand
\r (Mat. 12:9-14; Luk. 6:6-11)
\p
\v 1 And again another time, Jesus went to the meeting hall and there was a man¦23605 there with a curled-up hand¦23613.
\v 2 The religious leaders there were watching him closely to see if he would heal the man on the rest day, and then if he did, they would have a case against him.
\v 3 Then Jesus said to the man¦23633 with the flawed hand¦23639, “Stand up there in the middle.”
\v 4 And he asked the leaders, “Is it allowable to do good¦23667 on the rest day, or only to do evil? To save¦23674 life¦23673, or to kill?” But they didn't reply.
\p
\v 5 After angrily looking around at them, grieving at their complete lack of compassion, he said to the man, “Open up your hand!”
\v 6 The man stretched out his fingers, and his hand became totally normal. But the Pharisees quickly left, and meeting with King Herod's supporters, they conspired to kill Jesus.
\s1 Big crowds press on Jesus
\p
\v 7 After that, Jesus withdrew towards the lake with his followers, and a huge crowd of people from the regions of both Galilee and down in Judea,
\v 8 along with others from Jerusalem, Idumea, from across the Jordan River, and from up near Tyre and Sidon. They came¦23798 because they had heard about the amazing things he had done.
\v 9 \x + \xo 3:9-10: \xt Mrk 4:1; Luk 5:1-3.\x*So Jesus asked his apprentices to organise a small boat¦23808 to be there for him so he wouldn't be cramped by the press of the crowd.
\v 10 Virtually anyone who had any physical issues was pressing towards him to touch him, because he had already healed¦23822 so many.
\v 11 And the demons, whenever they saw Jesus, they fell down to the ground in front of him and yelled out, “You are God's son!”
\v 12 But he regularly warned them not to reveal who he was.
\s1 Jesus appoints his twelve representatives
\r (Mat. 10:1-4; Luk. 6:12-16)
\p
\v 13 As Jesus started climbing up a hill, he called the followers that he had selected, and they went¦23899 off with him.
\v 14 He appointed twelve¦23906 of them as his representatives so that they¦23914 could stick with him¦23917 and¦23922 be sent off to be proclaiming his message
\v 15 and to also have authority¦23934 to exorcise demons.
\p
\v 16 These are the twelve¦23950 that he appointed: Simon (but he appended the name¦23953 “Peter”),
\v 17 Jacob and his brother¦23968 John who were Zebedee's sons (and he nicknamed them the “sons of thunder”),
\v 18 Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, Jacob Alphaeus, Thaddeus, Simon from Canaan,
\v 19 and Judas Iscariot who later betrayed him.
\s1 The two opposing spiritual powers
\r (Mat. 12:22-32; Luk. 11:14-23; 12:10)
\p
\v 20 Then Jesus was approaching a house¦24043, but the crowd swarmed them again so they had no opportunity to eat.
\v 21 The ones with him heard all the noise and came¦24071 to get him, because they were wondering if he was crazy.
\p
\v 22 \x + \xo 3:22: \xt Mat 9:34; 10:25.\x*The religious teachers had come¦24089 up from Jerusalem and were complaining, “He's possessed by the prince of demons. He can command them because he rules them!”
\p
\v 23 But Jesus addressed them: “How could Satan command himself?
\v 24 If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom could never prosper.
\v 25 If a household is divided against itself, that family will never prosper.
\v 26 So if Satan¦24162 attacked himself¦24168 and was split, he¦24175 couldn't possibly be powerful, but his time would be over.
\p
\v 27 On the contrary, no one can enter the house of a strong man to clean out his possessions unless he first ties up that strong man—after that he can work on the goods.
\p
\v 28 Honestly, I assure you¦24223 that any sin of a person can be forgiven, no matter how much they¦24244 curse God.
\v 29 \x + \xo 3:29: \xt Luk 12:10.\x*But whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit can never be forgiven, but¦24262 is eternally responsible for their sin¦24269.”
\v 30 (He said this because they¦24272 were saying¦24272 that he was demon-possessed.)
\s1 Jesus' mother and brothers arrive
\r (Mat. 12:46-50; Luk. 8:19-21)
\p
\v 31 Now Jesus' mother¦24289 and brothers¦24293 came and were standing outside and asked someone to tell him that they were there.
\v 32 Some in the crowd sitting around him told Jesus that his mother¦24323 and brothers¦24327 were waiting outside for him.
\p
\v 33 But Jesus answered, “Who is my mother¦24352 and¦24354 who are my brothers?”
\v 34 And having looked¦24360 around at the people sitting here, he said, “Actually, you all are my mother¦24375 and my brothers.
\v 35 For whoever obeys God, that person is my brother¦24395 and my sister¦24398 and my mother¦24401.”
\c 4
\s1 The parable about planting seed
\r (Mat. 13:1-9; Luk. 8:4-8)
\p
\v 1 \x + \xo 4:1: \xt Luk 5:1-3.\x*Again Jesus started teaching by the edge of the lake. A huge crowd gathered¦24413 around him, but he had boarded the boat¦24428 floating in the water, and all the people were there on the land.
\v 2 And he taught them many different things¦24464 in parables, including this one:
\v 3 “Listen. Once there was a farmer who went to spread some seed.
\v 4 As he spread it, some landed on the path, and the birds came and feed on it.
\v 5 Some landed on a rocky part without a lot of soil, and it quickly sprouted in the warm, shallow soil,
\v 6 but when the sun¦24546 came up, it dried out because the roots weren't deep, and so it just withered¦24555 up.
\v 7 Some of the seed landed in a thistle patch, and the thistles grew and choked it out, so the plants never bore a crop.
\v 8 But some seed landing in fertile soil and it bore a harvest—some of it multiplying thirty¦24605 times, some sixty¦24611, and some a hundred times.”
\p
\v 9 Then Jesus added, “Whoever wants to understand, let them consider it.”
\s1 Why Jesus speaks in parables
\r (Mat. 13:10-17; Luk. 8:9-10)
\p
\v 10 And when the crowd had left, the twelve¦24653 apprentices asked him about the parables.
\v 11 And he told them, “You've been given understanding about God's kingdom, but for others, they'll get it in parables
\q1
\v 12 \x + \xo 4:12: \xt Isa 6:9-10 (LXX).\x*so that when they look they might see but not perceive,
\q1 and when they listen, they might hear but not understand,
\q1 otherwise they might turn¦24703 \add from their sins\add* and be forgiven.”
\s1 Explaining about the ground where the seed fell
\r (Mat. 13:18-23; Luk. 8:11-15)
\p
\v 13 Then Jesus said to them, “If you didn't understand this parable, how will you understand any others?
\v 14 The one spreading seed is spreading the Good News.
\v 15 And there are some along the path where the Good News is being spread, who hear, but Satan turns up immediately and snatches the message from them.
\v 16 And similarly, there's some the falls onto rocky places¦24782 where the people who hear the Good News happily accept it,
\v 17 but don't make strong roots, just temporary \add changes\add*. So when they get mocked or attacked about accepting the Good News, they quickly stumble.
\v 18 Others are the ones where the seed was spread among the thistles. They heard the Good News,
\v 19 but contemporary topics, or the lure of money, or the appetite for other things¦24863 choke their good intentions and the message¦24868 becomes unfruitful in them.
\v 20 But lastly, the seed that landed on the good¦24885 soil represents the people who hear the Good News, accept it and are fruitful thirty¦24901, sixty¦24905, or even a hundred times over.”
\s1 The light will shine on everything
\r (Luk. 8:16-18)
\p
\v 21 \x + \xo 4:21: \xt Mat 5:15; Luk 11:33.\x*And Jesus told them, “Obviously no one goes and gets a lamp, and then puts it under a basket or under the bed, but rather places it somewhere higher on a stand.
\v 22 \x + \xo 4:22: \xt Mat 10:26; Luk 12:2.\x*You see, nothing is hidden that won't eventually be disclosed, and¦24955 there's no secret that won't eventually be revealed.
\v 23 Anyone who wants to understand, let them listen carefully.”
\p
\v 24 \x + \xo 4:24: \xt Mat 7:2; Luk 6:38.\x*And he continued, “Take care what you listen to. Because how much you judge others, so too will judgement be handed out to you, and even more.
\v 25 \x + \xo 4:25: \xt Mat 13:12; 25:29; Luk 19:26.\x*Whoever has \add faith\add* will be given \add a reward\add*, but if you have none, even the little you have will be taken away.”
\s1 The parable concerning the seed
\p
\v 26 And then, “God's kingdom¦25014 is like a person throwing some seed onto the ground.
\v 27 Whether the person sleeps at night or stays up night and day¦25041, the seed will sprout and grow either way, and they don't know how it does it.
\v 28 The earth is \add designed\add* to multiply the seed: first a sprout appears, then a bigger plant, and then the full head of grain.
\v 29 \x + \xo 4:29: \xt Joel 3:13.\x*And when it's ripe, then the harvester is sent in because it's ready for harvest.”
\s1 The small seed produces a large result
\r (Mat. 13:31-32,34; Luk. 13:18-19)
\p
\v 30 Again he said, “What could we like God's kingdom¦25101 to? Or what parable could we explain it with?
\v 31 It's like planting a mustard seed in the ground—a very small seed.
\v 32 But when it's planted and grows up, it forms a large bush with many branches¦25170 so that birds can rest in its shade.”
\p
\v 33 And so as much as they¦25195 could handle it, Jesus shared the Good News with them via many similar word pictures.
\v 34 He never spoke without these illustrations, but he explained all of them to his close followers.
\s1 Jesus halts the storm on the lake
\r (Mat. 8:23-27; Luk. 8:22-25)
\p
\v 35 It was already becoming evening on that day¦25221, so Jesus said \add to his apprentices\add*, “Let's all go across to the other shore.”
\v 36 So they left the crowd behind and got into the boat¦25241 with him.
\v 37 \add Out in the lake\add* a big storm came up with strong winds, and the waves started breaking across the boat and filling it.
\v 38 But Jesus slept on in the back, sleeping on a cushion. They woke him and cried, “Teacher, don't you care that we're all about to drown?”
\p
\v 39 Now awake, Jesus scolded the wind and waves, “Quieten down! Stop that!” Then the wind died down and the water became¦25331 very calm.
\v 40 And \add turning back to them\add* he asked, “Why were you all so afraid? Don't you have any faith¦25347 yet?”
\p
\v 41 But now they were very afraid \add again\add* and asked each other, “Who could this man be that both the wind and waves obey him?”
\c 5
\s1 Jesus send the demons into the pigs
\r (Mat. 8:28-34; Luk. 8:26-39)
\p
\v 1 So they¦25377 got \add safely\add* to the region of Gerasenes on the other side of the lake.
\v 2 As Jesus climbed out of the boat¦25404, a demon-possessed man¦25414 came out of the tombs to meet him.
\v 3 He lived in those tombs, and¦25427 no one could tie him¦25438 up, not even with chains,
\v 4 because he had often been tied up in the past with shackles and chains but had always pulled the chains apart and smashed the shackles, and no one was able to subdue him.
\v 5 All through the day¦25489 and night, whether in the tombs or up in the hills, he was yelling out and hurting himself with stones¦25509.
\p
\v 6 So when he had seen¦25511 Jesus¦25514 in the distance, he ran¦25517 and \add as a sign of honour\add* fell to the ground in front of him.
\v 7 Then he called out very loudly, “What will happen between us, Jesus, the son of the highest God? I beg you in God's name not to torment me.”
\v 8 Because Jesus had already started saying, “Come out of the man¦25563 you¦25555 ungodly spirit!”
\p
\v 9 Jesus asked, “What's your name?”
\p The man answered, “My name is ‘Thousands’ because there's many of us,”
\v 10 and he begged Jesus not to send¦25599 them out of the country¦25604.
\p
\v 11 It just so happened that there was a large herd of pigs being fed on the hill nearby
\v 12 and they¦25625 begged Jesus again saying, “Send us to the pigs so that we¦25646 can enter them.”
\v 13 Jesus agreed to that, so the ungodly spirits came out of the man, went into the pigs, and the entire herd of some two thousand pigs rushed down the steep bank into the sea and were drowned.
\p
\v 14 The ones who had been feeding them rushed off and spread the news around in the city¦25707 and the surrounding area. So the people hurried out to see¦25715 what had happened.
\v 15 When they arrived where Jesus was, they saw the man who had been demon-possessed fully-clothed and sitting there in full control of his senses. They knew it was the man called ‘Thousands’ and they became frightened.
\v 16 Those who had seen¦25749 it all happen described it all to the people—what had happened both to the demon-possessed man and to the pigs.
\p
\v 17 So then the people began asking Jesus to go¦25766 away from their region.
\p
\v 18 As Jesus was climbing back into the boat¦25778, the man who had been demon-possessed wanted to go with him.
\p
\v 19 But Jesus wouldn't let him and told him to head back home¦25806 to his own people¦25810, and explain to them what the Master had done for him and how he had been merciful to him.
\p
\v 20 So he went¦25831 away and shared with the people of the Ten Cities region what Jesus had done for him, and they were all amazed.
\s1 A woman is healed as Jesus goes to help a dying girl
\r (Mat. 9:18-26; Luk. 8:40-56)
\p
\v 21 When Jesus¦25852 had crossed in the boat¦25855 to the other side of the lake, a large crowd of people came out to the lake edge to see him.
\v 22 A religious leader named Jairus came out, and when he found Jesus he fell down at his feet¦25894
\v 23 and pleaded, “My young daughter¦25906 is critical and just hanging on for you to come¦25911 and touch her¦25924 so that she¦25927 can be healed¦25927 and live.”
\p
\v 24 So Jesus went¦25933 off with Jairus. The large crowd followed also and¦25942 many were getting pressed against Jesus.
\p
\v 25 Then a woman¦25946 came who had been losing blood¦25951 for twelve¦25953 years
\v 26 and who had endured much under various doctors despite spending everything she had. After all that, she'd ended up even worse,
\v 27 but when she heard about what Jesus had been doing, she worked her way through the crowd to the back of Jesus and touched his clothes,
\v 28 because she¦25999 had told herself, “If I could even just touch his clothes, I would be healed.”
\p
\v 29 And immediately¦26018 the bleeding stopped and she knew¦26027 that she had been healed.
\v 30 Immediately also, Jesus knew that power¦26049 had gone out of him, and he turned¦26054 back towards the crowd and said, “Who touched my clothes?”
\p
\v 31 But his followers said, “You can see all the people that were pressing on you so why would you ask who touched you?”
\p
\v 32 But Jesus was still looking¦26087 around to see¦26088 who had done it.
\v 33 And the woman¦26096, scared and shaking because of what was happening, came¦26109 and fell down in front of Jesus and told him the whole story.
\v 34 Jesus said, “Daughter, your faith¦26134 has healed¦26136 you. Go¦26131 in peace¦26140 and full health.”
\p
\v 35 While he was still speaking, messengers came from Jairus' house to tell him, “Your daughter¦26159 has died. Why bother the teacher¦26166 any more?”
\p
\v 36 But Jesus overheard them telling this to the leader¦26180 and told him, “Don't be afraid—keep believing.”
\v 37 And Jesus didn't allow anyone to accompany him¦26193 other than Peter, and Jacob and his brother, John.
\v 38 As they¦26213 approached Jairus' house¦26218, Jesus saw a big commotion with lots of crying and yelling going on.
\v 39 As he entered, he said, “Why are you all crying in distress? The child¦26244 hasn't died—she's just sleeping!”
\p
\v 40 But they just ridiculed Jesus. So he sent them all outside, just taking the father¦26268 and mother¦26276 of the child, along with three with him. He went in where the girl was
\v 41 and taking her hand¦26297, he said, “Young woman, I tell you: get up!”
\v 42 Immediately she got up and walked around. And everyone marvelled at the amazing thing that had happened. (She was twelve¦26331 years old.)
\v 43 Jesus repeatedly told them to keep this to themselves, and¦26347 added that they should give her¦26351 something to eat.
\c 6
\s1 Jesus' community can't believe he's from God
\r (Mat. 13:53-58; Luk. 4:16-30)
\p
\v 1 So Jesus left there and went back with his followers to his hometown.
\v 2 It was now the Rest Day and when he started teaching in the meeting hall, many who heard him were astonished, saying, “Where did he learn all this? How could he have such wisdom and be able to do these miracles?
\v 3 Isn't this the carpenter, the son of Mary, and the brother¦26431 of Jacob and Joseph and Judas and Simon? Don't his sisters¦26448 live around here?” And they¦26455 were offended by his teaching.
\p
\v 4 \x + \xo 6:4: \xt Jn 4:44.\x*Jesus told them, “A prophet is only dishonouring in his own home town¦26474, and among his own relatives, and in his own home.”
\p
\v 5 And he wasn't able to do even one miracle there, except for placing his hands¦26505 on a few sick people and healing them.
\v 6 He was amazed at how they wouldn't believe him as he went around the villages teaching.
\s1 Jesus sends his apprentices out in pairs
\r (Mat. 10:5-15; Luk. 9:1-6)
\p
\v 7 Then he called his twelve¦26528 apprentices and started sending¦26533 them out in pairs and giving¦26540 them authority¦26544 over demons.
\v 8 He insisted that they¦26555 can carry a walking stick but not to take food, a backpack, or money.
\v 9 They could wear one pair of sandals, but¦26578 not take changes of clothes.
\v 10 And he told them, “Whenever you are invited into a home, stay at that one place until you leave that town.
\v 11 \x + \xo 6:11: \xt Acts 13:51.\x*But if any places don't want you or don't want to hear what you have to say, just leave that place. As you go, shake the dust off your sandals so they can see \add that you pass the responsibility of what happened to them\add*.
\p
\v 12 So the apprentices went off and started telling people to repent.
\v 13 \x + \xo 6:13: \xt Jam 5:14.\x*And they drove out many demons, and anointed many sick people with olive oil and healed them.
\s1 The execution of John-the-Immerser
\r (Mat. 14:1-12; Luk. 9:7-9)
\p
\v 14 \x + \xo 6:14-15: \xt Mat 16:14; Mrk 8:28; Luk 9:19.\x*Jesus was now becoming well known and King Herod \add Antipas\add* heard about him. He thought that maybe John-the-Immerser had come back to life and that's why he was able to do miracles.
\p
\v 15 But others thought it was \add the promised return of\add* Elijah, and¦26716 yet others thought he must be another prophet like the ones \add in the Scriptures\add*.
\p
\v 16 But hearing about Jesus, Herod was telling people, “That John who I had beheaded, he must have come back to life!”
\v 17 \x + \xo 6:17-18: \xt Luk 3:19-20.\x*Because Herod himself had had John arrested and put in prison¦26768 because he had married Herodias, his brother¦26776 Philip's wife¦26773.
\v 18 John had been telling him that it was wrong for him to marry his brother's wife¦26797,
\v 19 and so Herodias resented him enough to want to kill him, but Herod hadn't be able to
\v 20 because he respected John as a righteous and holy teacher and so he kept him alive. He often enjoyed hearing from John and thought a lot about what he said.
\p
\v 21 However, an opportunity came at Herod's birthday celebration, when he threw a feast for his top officials and generals and for the leaders¦26868 in Galilee.
\v 22 The daughter¦26876 of Herodias came in and danced for them, and the king and his party guests all enjoyed it. So the king said to the young woman, “Just ask me for anything and I'll give it to you.”
\v 23 And he made an oath, “Even if you asked for half of my kingdom, I'd give it to you!”
\p
\v 24 So she went out and asked her mother what she should ask for. Her mother told her that she should ask for John's head.
\p
\v 25 So going back into the party, she¦26967 said seriously to the king, “I would like the head of John-the-Immerser on a plate!”
\p
\v 26 The king¦26991 was really upset with that, but because he had made loud oaths in front of all his guests, he couldn't say no.
\v 27 So he ordered an executioner to go out and return with John's head. He went off and beheaded him in the prison¦27032
\v 28 and brought the head into the party on a plate and gave it to the girl, and she gave it to her mother¦27052.
\v 29 When John's followers heard about this, they came¦27060 and fetched his body and put it into a tomb.
\s1 Jesus feeds 5,000 people
\r (Mat. 14:13-21; Luk. 9:10-17; Jn 6:1-14)
\p
\v 30 Now the apprentices who had been sent out returned back to Jesus¦27081 and they reported back everything they had done and what they had been teaching \add people\add*.
\v 31 Then he told them, “Let's just all of us head for a quiet place¦27109 and take a break.” This was because there were so many people always coming¦27119 and going, and sometimes they didn't even have a chance to eat.
\v 32 So they¦27133 went¦27133 by boat¦27138 away to a quiet place¦27143 by themselves.
\p
\v 33 But people from towns all around had seen them going¦27153 and recognised who they were, so they ran¦27172 around the lake on foot¦27164 and got there ahead of them.
\v 34 \x + \xo 6:34: \xt Num 27:17; 1Ki 22:17; 2Ch 18:16; Eze 34:5; Mat 9:36.\x*So when Jesus got out of the boat, he saw¦27188 a big crowd and felt sorry for them because they seemed like sheep¦27205 without a shepherd¦27208, so he started teaching them many things¦27215.
\v 35 Then, when it was already getting late, his apprentices came up and said, “This place¦27236 is pretty isolated and it's already late.
\v 36 Send these people off now so they can go to the nearby settlements and villages and buy themselves something to eat.”
\p
\v 37 But Jesus answered them, “You give them something to eat.”
\p They complained, “If we go, should we buy several months wages worth of bread so we can give all of them something to eat?”
\p
\v 38 But he¦27301 asked, “Go and find out how much bread you¦27310 have.”
\p When they'd found out they said, “Five buns and two¦27323 fish.”
\p
\v 39 Jesus told all the people to line up in rows and sit down on the green grass.
\v 40 So they sat down in rows of fifty¦27355 to a hundred.
\v 41 Then holding the five buns and two fish, he looking up to the sky¦27368 and blessed \add God\add*, and then broke up the buns and gave pieces to his apprentices so they could do likewise to the people, and he also divided up the two fish,
\v 42 and all the people ate and were satisfied.
\v 43 Then they¦27400 collected the left-over pieces of bread, filling twelve¦27403 baskets, as well as the left-over pieces of fish.
\v 44 And the headcount of men¦27423 who ate that evening was five¦27421 thousand.
\s1 Jesus walks on the lake surface
\r (Mat. 14:22-33; Jn 6:15-21)
\p
\v 45 Straight after that, Jesus sent his apprentices off in the boat¦27435 to go across to Bethsaida while he sent the crowd home.
\v 46 Then he said goodbye to everyone, and climbed the hill to pray.
\v 47 Later in the night, the boat¦27467 was out in the middle of the lake, and only Jesus remained back there on the land.
\v 48 He saw them struggling to row against the wind, and sometime after 3am he came out to them, walking¦27511 on the lake surface as if to walk past them.
\v 49 But they had seen¦27525 someone walking¦27531 on the lake and thought it was a ghost, and they yelled out
\v 50 because they had all seen it and were terrified.
\p But Jesus immediately¦27550 spoke¦27552 to them and said, “Hey, take heart, it's me, don't be afraid!”
\v 51 Then he climbed up into the boat¦27574 and the wind died down. And they were all totally astounded
\v 52 because they¦27593 hadn't understood the implications of him feeding all the people because their minds were closed.
\s1 Jesus heals many people around Gennesaret
\r (Mat. 14:34-36)
\p
\v 53 After completing their crossing, they¦27613 anchored at Gennesaret¦27615.
\v 54 And when they got out of the boat¦27624, again people recognised Jesus
\v 55 and ran¦27636 around that region, so next minute people began bringing all of those who were sick, carrying them on pallets to wherever they heard that Jesus was.
\v 56 And whenever Jesus entered villages or cities¦27685 or fields¦27688 or marketplaces, they laid the sick down there and were imploring him that they might even just touch the edge of his robe, and anyone who did so was healed.
\c 7
\s1 Jesus suggests obeying God, not tradition
\r (Mat. 15:1-9)
\p
\v 1 Some from the Pharisee party and¦27726 some of the law teachers had come¦27730 from Jerusalem to observe Jesus
\v 2 and noticed that some of his followers were eating their food without following their religious customs, i.e., without washing their hands¦27744.
\v 3 (The Pharisees and, in fact, all the Jewish religious leaders do not eat without first ceremonially washing their hands¦27768 as taught by their elders over the generations.
\v 4 They won't eat at the market if they can't do this first, and have many other regulations about ceremonial washing of cups and jugs and copper kettles.)
\p
\v 5 And the Pharisees and religious teachers asked Jesus, “How come your followers don't follow our Jewish traditions, but¦27835 eat without the ceremonial washing of hands¦27841?”
\p
\v 6 \x + \xo 7:6-7: \xt Isa 29:13 (LXX).\x*And he answered, “Isaiah got it exactly right when he expressed God's thoughts about you hypocrites and wrote:
\q1 ‘These people¦27867 honour me with their lips,
\q2 but their real desires are far away from mine.
\q1
\v 7 Their worship of me is worthless,
\q2 teaching man-made rules as if they¦27886 are from God.’
\p
\v 8 You've ignored God's commands instead accepting human traditions.
\p
\v 9 And Jesus continued, “You all simply dismiss God's commands in favour of your own customs.
\v 10 \x + \xo 7:10: a \xt Exo 20:12; Deu 5:16; \xo b \xt Exo 21:17; Lev 20:9.\x*Moses teaches us,
\q1 ‘Honour your parents,’
\p and
\q1 ‘Anyone dishonestly slandering their parents deserves the death penalty.’
\m
\v 11 But when you all encourage people to say, ‘Whatever I had that may have helped you guys has been given to God’,
\v 12 you are actively discouraging them from helping their parents—
\v 13 overriding God's voice for your very convenient teaching that you disseminate instead. And that's not the only example!”
\s1 Evil comes from inside a person
\r (Mat. 15:10-20)
\p
\v 14 Jesus called out to the crowd, “Everyone listen to me carefully:
\v 15 Nothing that enters your mouth makes you guilty in God's eyes. It's what comes \em out\em* of you that demonstrates your culpability.”
\p
\v 16 ≈
\v 17 When Jesus came¦28084 back inside, his apprentices asked him what he meant.
\v 18 But he scolded them, “Can't you understand something so simple! Can't you see that anything from the outside that enters your body doesn't make you guilty in God's sight,
\v 19 because it doesn't enter your mind but merely goes into your stomach and ends up in the toilet.” (By saying this he clearly showed that is was ok for Jews to eat any food.)
\p
\v 20 He continued, “It's what comes out of you that makes you guilty in God's eyes.
\v 21-22 That's because evil¦28184 thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery, greed, wickedness, deceit, arrogance, lust, slander, pride, and foolishness all come from \em inside\em* people's hearts \add and minds\add*.
\v 23 So it's the evil¦28213 that's inside a person and¦28217 comes out that makes them guilty in God's eyes.”
\s1 The bold faith of a non-Jewish woman
\r (Mat. 15:21-28)
\p
\v 24 Jesus left that place and went¦28227 \add up north\add* into the regions of Tyre and Sidon. He tried to enter a house¦28239 without being noticed but didn't succeed,
\v 25 and straight away a woman¦28258 who had heard about him turned up. She knelt in front of him because she had a little daughter¦28264 who was demon-possessed.
\v 26 The woman¦28284 was Greek from Phoenicia in Syria and she¦28295 begged Jesus to command the demon to leave her¦28306 daughter¦28305.
\v 27 But he replied, “Let the \add Jewish\add* children be treated first, because it's not good to take the children's food and throw it to the dogs.”
\p
\v 28 And she¦28335 responded, “Yes, master, but the puppies under the table¦28354 \em do\em* get to eat the little crumbs that the children¦28363 drop.”
\p
\v 29 And he answered, “Go home now. As a result of how you just spoke, the demon has already left your daughter¦28378.”
\p
\v 30 And when she¦28389 got home¦28386, the demon had indeed gone and her little girl was lying quietly on her bed.
\s1 Jesus heals a deaf man who couldn't speak
\p
\v 31 Jesus left the Tyre region, passed through Sidon, and came¦28417 down the \add eastern\add* side of the Lake of Galilee to the Decapolis region.
\v 32 The people there brought a man¦28442 to him who couldn't hear or speak, and asked Jesus to heal him.
\v 33 So Jesus took the man back away from the crowd, put his fingers¦28470 in the man's ears, then he spat and touched the man's mouth.
\v 34 Looking up to the sky¦28489, he sighed and said, “Open up!”
\p
\v 35 Then the man could hear, and his tongue¦28516 was released¦28512 and he began to speak properly.
\v 36 The Jesus advised that they shouldn't tell anyone, but the more he said that, the more they seemed to spread it¦28540 around.
\v 37 The crowds were totally amazed, saying, “He can do anything—he makes the deaf able to hear, and enables the ones who couldn't speak.”
\c 8
\s1 Jesus feeds 4,000 people
\r (Mat. 15:32-39)
\p
\v 1 Another time there was a large crowd again with nothing to eat. Jesus called his apprentices and¦28570 said,
\v 2 “I feel sorry for all these people because they've already been with us for three¦28598 days¦28595 and¦28607 don't have anything to eat.
\v 3 I can't send¦28614 them home¦28620 because they're too weak to walk, and some have a long way to go.”
\p
\v 4 His apprentices queried, “Where could anyone find enough food out here in the wilderness?”
\p
\v 5 He asked, “How much bread have you¦28675 all got?”
\p “Seven buns,” they¦28678 answered.
\p
\v 6 So Jesus instructed the crowd to sit down on the ground. Then he took the seven¦28695 buns, gave thanks and broke them and gave pieces to his apprentices to then distribute to the crowd.
\v 7 They also had a few small cooked fish, so he blessed them too and¦28718 got them to distribute them as well.
\v 8 After all the people had eaten and were full, they collected seven¦28751 basketfulls of leftovers.
\v 9 There were some four¦28760 thousand people there that day, and Jesus sent¦28762 them home after they'd eaten.
\v 10 And he and his apprentices climbed into the boat¦28774 and headed for the Dalmanutha¦28790 region.
\s1 The religious leaders want to see a miracle
\r (Mat. 16:1-4)
\p
\v 11 \x + \xo 8:11: \xt Mat 12:38; Luk 11:16.\x*Some men from the Pharisee party came¦28795 out to Jesus amd started arguing with him. They were checking him out and wanted to see a miracle.
\v 12 \x + \xo 8:12: \xt Mat 12:39; Luk 11:29.\x*Jesus grieved inside and asked, “Why do you people need to see a miracle before you'll believe me? Actually, no miracle will be done for this generation.”
\p
\v 13 So Jesus left in the boat again and crossed to the other side of the lake.
\s1 The apprentices miss the significance of what's happening
\r (Mat. 16:5-12)
\p
\v 14 But Jesus' apprentices forgot to take any food other than one bun that someone in the boat¦28883 had.
\v 15 \x + \xo 8:15: \xt Luk 12:1.\x*He told them, “Watch out for the yeast of the Pharisees and¦28897 of King Herod.”
\p
\v 16 They asked each other what it meant—was it because they forgot food?
\p
\v 17 But Jesus knew what they were saying¦28921 and asked, “Why are you all discussing about not having food? Can't you figure it¦28918 out? Or are your minds completely closed?
\v 18 \x + \xo 8:18: \xt Jer 5:21; Eze 12:2; Mrk 4:12.\x*You all have eyes¦28951 but can't seem to see and have ears but can't seem to listen. Have you already forgotten what just happened?
\v 19 When I broke up the five buns to feed five thousand people, how many basketfulls of leftovers did you collect?”
\p “Twelve,” they answered.
\p
\v 20 “And when we fed four¦29003 thousand with seven¦28999 buns, how many full baskets of leftovers then?”
\p “Seven,” they¦29018 answered.
\p
\v 21 Jesus asked, “How can you all not understand what's going on right in front of you!”
\s1 Jesus heals a blind man near Bethsaida
\p
\v 22 As they entered Bethsaida, the people brought a blind man¦29041 to Jesus and asked him to touch him.
\v 23 So Jesus took the man's hand and led him out of the village. Then he spat in his eyes¦29069, placed his hands¦29074 on him, and asked him, “What can you see?”
\p
\v 24 The man looked¦29089 around and answered, “I can see the people¦29096, but they just look like trees.”
\v 25 Jesus touched the man's eyes¦29114 again and then he could see clearly—he was now completely better.
\v 26 Then Jesus told him not to go back into the village but to go straight home¦29145.
\s1 Jesus asks who they think he is
\r (Mat. 16:13-20; Luk. 9:18-21)
\p
\v 27 Then Jesus and his followers moved around the various villages of Caesaria Philippi. On the way, he asked them, “Who does everyone think I am?”
\p
\v 28 \x + \xo 8:28: \xt Mrk 6:14-15; Luk 9:7-8.\x*They said, “Some say John-the-Immerser, some say Elijah, and¦29219 some say one of the prophets.”
\p
\v 29 \x + \xo 8:29: \xt Jn 6:68-69.\x*Then he asked, “And what do you all think?”
\p Peter said, “You are the promised one sent by God.”
\p
\v 30 Then Jesus warned¦29262 them not to tell others about him.
\s1 Jesus' radical challenge to his would-be followers
\r (Mat. 16:21-28; Luk. 9:22-27)
\p
\v 31 Then Jesus¦29283 began teaching his followers that mankind's child would need to suffer a lot, to be rejected by the religious leaders, and so to be put to death but to come back to life after three¦29304 days¦29306.
\v 32 He taught this very clearly, but Peter took him aside and told him off.
\v 33 Jesus turned¦29326 back and looked at the others, then reprimanded Peter, “Stand back, Satan! you're applying human values instead of considering God's plan.”
\p
\v 34 \x + \xo 8:34: \xt Mat 10:38; Luk 14:27.\x*Calling out to them and to the crowd, he said, “Anyone who wants to follow me must first put aside their own desires and then follow me—even through very difficult times.
\v 35 \x + \xo 8:35: \xt Mat 10:39; Luk 17:33; Jn 12:25.\x*Anyone who worries about saving their own life will lose it, but whoever gives their life due to following me and my teaching will save their life.
\v 36 Because it doesn't benefit a person if they gain everything in the world but lose their soul.
\v 37 What can someone offer in order to buy a home for their soul?
\v 38 Yes, whoever is ashamed of me and my message in front of this adulterous and sinful generation¦29464, mankind's child will likewise be ashamed of them when he comes clearly displaying God's¦29474 greatness and bringing the holy angels¦29488.”
\c 9
\p
\v 1 And he continued, “I can assure you that some of the ones standing here won't die until they have seen God's powerful kingdom¦29518 arrive.”
\s1 Moses and Elijah speak with Jesus
\r (Mat. 17:1-13; Luk. 9:28-36)
\p
\v 2 \x + \xo 9:2-7: \xt 2Pe 1:17-18.\x*Six days¦29526 later Jesus took Peter and Jacob and John, and just the four of them went up onto a high hill. Then he was changed right in front of their eyes
\v 3 and his clothes turned incredibly shining white—whiter than any bleach could make them.
\v 4 And Elijah and Moses appeared beside Jesus and started talking with him.
\v 5 Peter said to Jesus, “Teacher, it's good¦29616 that we're here. Maybe we could make three¦29628 shelters up here: one for you¦29630 and one for Moses and one for Elijah?”
\v 6 He said that because they¦29650 were terrified and didn't know what to say.
\p
\v 7 \x + \xo 9:7: \xt Mat 3:17; Mrk 1:11; Luk 3:22.\x*Then a cloud came over the sun and a voice came out of the cloud saying, “This is my dear son. Listen to him.”
\v 8 When they looked¦29685 around, they couldn't see anyone else there any more, except for Jesus¦29696 himself.
\p
\v 9 As they descended again, Jesus¦29725 told them to tell no one what had happened up there until after mankind's child came back to life.
\p
\v 10 They remembered that, although between all three of them they¦29734 couldn't understand the bit about coming back to life.
\v 11 \x + \xo 9:11: \xt Mal 4:5; Mat 11:14.\x*They asked Jesus, “Isn't it written that Elijah will be the first to return?”
\p
\v 12 He answered, “Yes, Elijah is indeed the one to come¦29777 first to start the restoration. But isn't it also written that mankind's child will suffer a lot and¦29797 be scorned?
\v 13 You see, Elijah has come¦29808 already, and they treated him just however they liked, just like it was written that it would happen.”
\s1 Jesus drives out a stubborn demon
\r (Mat. 17:14-21; Luk. 9:37-43a)
\p
\v 14 When they got back to \add his other\add* followers, Jesus saw¦29827 that they were surrounded by a large crowd and¦29835 the religious teachers were debating with them.
\v 15 The crowd were very surprised when they noticed Jesus and came running¦29860 to greet him.
\v 16 He asked¦29864 them, “What were you¦29869 all talking about?”
\p
\v 17 One of the people answered, “Teacher, I brought my son here—he has a demon that prevents him from speaking.
\v 18 Whenever it takes hold of him, it attacks him and he starts foaming at the mouth and grating his teeth and his joints lock up. I tried to get your followers to command it to leave but they couldn't.”
\p
\v 19 Jesus replied, “You are a faithless generation¦29940. How much longer will I have to be here? How much longer can I tolerate you all? Bring him¦29956 here.”
\v 20 So they brought the boy to him. When he saw Jesus, the demon immediately¦29971 caused him to have convulsions and fall on the ground—rolling over and foaming at the mouth.
\p
\v 21 Jesus asked¦29984 his father¦29987, “How long has this been happening?”
\p “Since he was small,” he replied,
\v 22 “and often it throws him into the fire¦30013 or into water to try to destroy him. But if you feel sorry for us and can do it, please help¦30030 us.”
\p
\v 23 Jesus asked him, “If I can? A person who believes can do anything.”
\p
\v 24 The boys father¦30058 cried out, “I do believe—help me to fight unbelief.”
\p
\v 25 Then Jesus noticing that a big crowd was quickly forming, scolded the evil spirit, “You spirit who causes muteness and deafness. Leave this boy now and never return to him.”
\p
\v 26 There was yelling and strong convulsions, and then the demon left him and the boy lay still as if dead, and many people thought he was.
\v 27 But Jesus¦30141 took his hand¦30145 and lifted it, and the boy got up.
\p
\v 28 When Jesus and his apprentices had gone into the house¦30159 by themselves, they asked him, “How come¦30154 we couldn't drive it¦30186 out?”
\p
\v 29 He replied, “This kind will only leave after prayer¦30202 and¦30203 fasting.”
\s1 Jesus talks again about being executed
\r (Mat. 17:22-23; Luk. 9:43b-45)
\p
\v 30 Then they¦30210 left that place and¦30214 were moving around Galilee, because Jesus didn't want people to know¦30219 where he was
\v 31 while he was teaching his apprentices. He told them, “mankind's child will be arrested and executed, but after three¦30248 days¦30250 he'll come back to life.”
\p
\v 32 But they didn't know what that meant, and they were too scared to ask¦30263 him.
\s1 How to be the best
\r (Mat. 18:1-5; Luk. 9:46-48)
\p
\v 33 Then they went Capernaum and when they arrived at the house¦30273, Jesus asked them what they were discussing on the way.
\p
\v 34 \x + \xo 9:34: \xt Luk 22:24.\x*But they didn't reply because while they were walking, they had been talking about which of them is the best.
\v 35 \x + \xo 9:35: \xt Mat 20:26-27; 23:11; Mrk 10:43-44; Luk 22:26.\x*So Jesus sat down and called the twelve¦30311 of them and explained, “Whoever wants to be at the top, has to be at the bottom and help all the others.”
\v 36 Then Jesus called a young boy and stood him in the middle of them, and giving him a hug said,
\v 37 \x + \xo 9:37: \xt Mat 10:40; Luk 10:16; Jn 13:20.\x*“Whoever welcomes young children¦30351 on my behalf, welcomes me, and¦30362 whoever welcomes me is not actually welcoming me, but¦30373 welcoming the one who sent¦30375 me here.”
\s1 Others are also serving Jesus
\r (Luk. 9:49-50)
\p
\v 38 John checked with Jesus¦30388, “Teacher, we saw¦30389 someone using your authority to command demons to leave, but we told him off because he wasn't one of us.”
\p
\v 39 Jesus responded, “No, don't stop him¦30421 because anyone who does a miracle using my name¦30431 won't just quickly¦30436 turn around and slander me.
\v 40 \x + \xo 9:40: \xt Mat 12:30; Luk 11:23.\x*Anyone who's not against us is for us.
\v 41 \x + \xo 9:41: \xt Mat 10:42.\x* Anyone who gives you water¦30459 to drink because you are followers of God's chosen one and who does it because they are working for me, I can assure you that they'll receive their reward.
\s1 Difficult teachings about disobedience
\r (Mat. 18:6-9; Luk. 17:1-2)
\p
\v 42 But anyone who causes a young person to falter from their trust in me, it would be better if they were thrown into the sea¦30520 with a heavy weight tied around their neck.
\v 43 \x + \xo 9:43: \xt Mat 5:30.\x*If your hand causes you to disobey God, cut it off—it's better to enter \add eternal\add* life¦30540 being maimed, than to have two¦30545 hands¦30546 but to be thrown into the fire¦30558 that never goes out.
\v 44 ≈
\v 45 And if your foot¦30576 causes you to disobey God, cut it off—it's better to enter \add eternal\add* life¦30595 being maimed, than to have two¦30603 feet¦30604 but to be thrown into hell.
\v 46 ≈
\v 47 \x + \xo 9:47: \xt Mat 5:29.\x*And if your eye causes you to disobey God, gouge it out—it's better to enter God's kingdom¦30648 one-eyed, than to have two¦30653 eyes¦30654 and be thrown into hell
\v 48 where the worms never die and¦30669 the fire¦30671 never goes out.
\p
\v 49 Everyone will be salted with fire.
\p
\v 50 \x + \xo 9:50: \xt Mat 5:13; Luk 14:34-35.\x*Now salt is good, but¦30691 if it were to go bad, what would you season \add your food\add* with then? So keep yourselves¦30707 like salt, and¦30711 strive to get on well with each other.
\c 10
\s1 It's God that joins husband and wife
\r (Mat. 19:1-12; Luk. 16:18)
\p
\v 1 Then Jesus left there and went down to the Judean area and across the Jordan river. Again the crowds followed him, and he taught them just like he usually did.
\p
\v 2 Some from the Pharisee party approached Jesus to check him out and asked, “Does the law allow a husband¦30761 to dismiss his wife¦30762?”
\p
\v 3 “Well, what law did Moses give to you¦30772 all?” he¦30766 asked.
\p
\v 4 \x + \xo 10:4: \xt Deu 24:1-4; Mat 5:31.\x*They answered, “Moses¦30782 said¦30778 that a husband is allowed to write¦30786 a statement of divorce and dismiss his wife with it.”
\p
\v 5 Jesus responded, “Yes, he wrote¦30800 that law because he saw your stubborn desires,
\v 6 \x + \xo 10:6: \xt Gen 1:27; 5:2.\x*but God made both men and¦30811 women right at the beginning.
\v 7 \x + \xo 10:7-8: \xt Gen 2:24.\x*As a result, a man¦30824 leaves his parents and joins together with his wife¦30838
\v 8 and the couple become a single unit. So there's no longer two of them, but only one.
\v 9 So if it's God who joins them together like that, no person \add has the authority\add* to separate them.”
\p
\v 10 Back in the house¦30873 again, his apprentices asked about this.
\v 11 \x + \xo 10:11-12: \xt Mat 5:32; 1Cor 7:10-11.\x*And Jesus told them, “Whoever divorces his wife and marries another person, commits adultery towards his wife.”
\v 12 And likewise if the wife divorces her husband and marries another person, she is committing adultery towards her husband.”
\s1 Jesus encourages childlike faith
\r (Mat. 19:13-15; Luk. 18:15-17)
\p
\v 13 The people were bringing small children¦30941 for Jesus to touch, but¦30947 his apprentices scolded them.
\v 14 However, Jesus noticed it and was upset, “Just let those kids come. Don't prevent them because God's kingdom¦30982 consists of people like them.
\v 15 \x + \xo 10:15: \xt Mat 18:3.\x*Actually, you can't even enter God's kingdom¦30996 unless you accept it¦31005 just like a small child¦31000 does.”
\v 16 So he continued hugging the children and \add commanding\add* a good life for them as he placed his hands¦31016 on each one.
\s1 Leaving behind everything to be saved
\r (Mat. 19:16-30; Luk. 18:18-30)
\p
\v 17 One time when Jesus was starting out on a trip, a man caught up to him and kneeling down in front of him asked, “Good teacher, what do I have to do to inherit eternal life¦31046?”
\p
\v 18 He answered, “Why do you call me \em good\em*? No person is good—only God is.
\v 19 \x + \xo 10:19: a \xt Exo 20:13; Deu 5:17; \xo b \xt Exo 20:14; Deu 5:18; \xo c \xt Exo 20:15; Deu 5:19; \xo d \xt Exo 20:16; Deu 5:20; \xo e \xt Exo 20:12; Deu 5:16.\x*You know the commandments: don't murder, don't commit adultery, don't steal, don't lie about others, don't defraud others, and honour your parents.”
\p
\v 20 The man responded, “I've kept all of those since I was young.”
\p
\v 21 Jesus looked up at him with genuine love and said, “There's one thing still to be done: sell everything you have and give¦31137 the money to the poor—then you'll have wealth in heaven¦31144. After¦31114 that, come¦31147 and follow me.”
\v 22 But the man grew very sad when he heard this, because he owned many properties.
\p
\v 23 Jesus looked¦31182 around at his followers, “It's so difficult for wealthy people to enter God's kingdom.”
\p
\v 24 His followers were a bit stunned at his teaching.) Jesus continued, “Yes, it's certainly difficult to enter into God's kingdom.
\v 25 It's easier for a camel¦31239 to go through the eye¦31243 of a needle than for a rich person to enter God's kingdom.”
\p
\v 26 Now they¦31261 were totally stunned, asking, “How can anyone possibly be saved¦31273 then?”
\p
\v 27 Jesus looked intently at them, “Yes, humanly it's quite impossible. But with God it's different—God can do anything!”
\p
\v 28 Peter said, “We left everything and came and followed¦31314 you.”
\p
\v 29 He answered, “Yes I can assure you¦31331 all that whoever left their home or farm, and left their siblings or parents or children¦31351 because of me and my teaching,
\v 30 they'll be rewarded one hundred times over with homes and farms and siblings and parents and children¦31389 along with persecution, but gaining eternal life¦31401 in the next era.
\v 31 \x + \xo 10:31: \xt Mat 20:16; Luk 13:30.\x*But many at the top now will be at the bottom then, and¦31410 many at the bottom now will be blessed then.”
\s1 Jesus predicts his execution a third time
\r (Mat. 20:17-19; Luk. 18:31-34)
\p
\v 32 They were heading south to Jerusalem with Jesus in front, and his followers were a bit surprised and a bit scared. Jesus took the twelve¦31441 aside and started telling them what was going to happen to him,
\v 33 “We're on our way down to Jerusalem and mankind's child will be turned over to the chief priests¦31461 and the religious teachers, and they'll sentence him to die and pass him over to the non-Jews.
\v 34 Then they'll ridicule him and spit on him before they beat him and execute him, but he'll come back to life again in three¦31495 days¦31497 time.”
\s1 How to become respected in God's kingdom
\r (Mat. 20:20-28)
\p
\v 35 Then Jacob and John, the two¦31510 sons¦31511 of Zebedee approached Jesus and asked, “Teacher, we'd like to ask a favour from you—please don't disappoint us.”
\p
\v 36 “What do you want from me?” Jesus asked.
\p
\v 37 They answered, “Allow us two to sit beside you in heaven—one of us on each side of you.”
\p
\v 38 \x + \xo 10:38: \xt Luk 12:50.\x*But Jesus replied, “You don't even understand what you're asking for. Do you think you could endure the suffering that I have to go through? Or to be enveloped in the darkness that I have to go down into?”
\p
\v 39 And they replied, “Sure we can.”
\p “And indeed you all will suffer like me and be enveloped in darkness like I will be,” responded Jesus,
\v 40 but as for deciding who will sit next to me, that's not my decision to make because it's already been decided.”
\p
\v 41 When the ten¦31658 other apprentices heard what these two had asked for, they were upset at Jacob and¦31669 John.
\v 42 \x + \xo 10:42-43: \xt Luk 22:25-26.\x*But Jesus¦31678 called them over, “Listen, in most countries their rulers boss the people around and¦31692 their leaders exert their authority¦31698 over them.
\v 43 \x + \xo 10:43-44: \xt Mat 23:11; Mrk 9:35; Luk 22:26.\x*But it doesn't work like that with you—anyone of you who wanted to be honoured must serve the others,
\v 44 and whoever wants to become the most respected has to \add work\add* like a slave¦31740 does.
\v 45 Even mankind's child didn't come to be served, but¦31750 to serve others and¦31752 to give¦31753 his life¦31755 as a ransom to set many people free.
\s1 Blind Bartimeus gets his miracle
\r (Mat. 20:29-34; Luk. 18:35-43)
\p
\v 46 They arrived at Jericho, and then when Jesus and his followers were leaving again with a large crowd following, they¦31762 came across blind Bartimeus sitting beside the path begging.
\v 47 When he heard that it was Jesus from Nazareth going past, he yelled out, “Jesus, \add promised\add* descendant of David, help me please.”
\p
\v 48 When several people told him to stop, he just yelled out even louder, “Jesus, \add promised\add* descendant of David¦31829, help me please.”
\p
\v 49 Then Jesus stopped and got the people to call the blind man¦31847. So they called him, “Hey, be confident! Get up and come because he's called for you.”
\p
\v 50 So Bartimeus threw off his jacket, jumped up, and was led to Jesus.
\p
\v 51 “Now, what can I do for you?” Jesus asked.
\p “My teacher¦31889, I'd like to be able to see,” Bartimeus replied.
\p
\v 52 Then Jesus responded, “Ok, off you go then—your faith¦31901 has saved¦31903 you.”
\p And immediately¦31907 Bartimeus was able to see, and followed along the path after Jesus.
\c 11
\s1 Jesus is treated like a king as he enters Jerusalem
\r (Mat. 21:1-11; Luk. 19:28-40; Jn 12:12-19)
\p
\v 1 As they¦31919 got close to Jerusalem and were passing Bethphage and Bethany on the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two¦31939 of his apprentices ahead, telling them,
\v 2 “Go on to the next village and as you enter it, you'll see a young donkey that hasn't ever been ridden yet. Untie it and bring it back here.
\v 3 If anyone asks what you're doing, tell them that the master needs it and he'll return it later.”
\p
\v 4 So they went ahead and found a donkey tied up on the path just outside the door¦32026 of a house, and so they went to untie it.
\v 5 But some of the people standing around there said, “Hoy! What do you think you're doing untying that donkey?”
\p
\v 6 So they¦32061 responded just as Jesus¦32059 had told them, and¦32060 the people allowed them to proceed.
\v 7 They brought the young donkey to Jesus, placing their coats¦32078 over it before Jesus mounted it.
\v 8 \add As Jesus rode it into Jerusalem,\add* many people laid their coats¦32094 on the road, while others lay down leafy branches¦32107 cut from trees in nearby fields.
\v 9 \x + \xo 11:9: \xt Psa 118:25-26.\x*Some went ahead and others came along behind, shouting, “This is the saviour who comes with the authority and blessing from God—
\v 10 the promised ancestor of King David who is blessed as he ushers in his kingdom—the blessed saviour from heaven.”
\p
\v 11 And so Jesus arrived in Jerusalem and went into the temple and looked¦32165 all around, but because it was now evening, he went back out to Bethania village with his twelve¦32179 apprentices.
\s1 Jesus curses a fig tree
\r (Mat. 21:18-19)
\p
\v 12 The next day¦32182 after they'd left Bethania, Jesus was hungry.
\v 13 From a distance he noticed a fig tree¦32196 that was in leaf so he went over to see if there was any fruit on it, but when he reached it there was only leaves because it wasn't the right season for figs.
\v 14 So he spoke to the tree, “No one in this age will ever eat fruit¦32269 from you again.” (His followers heard him say that.)
\s1 Jesus upsets the traders inside the temple
\r (Mat. 21:12-17; Luk. 19:45-48; Jn 2:13-22)
\p
\v 15 Then they came back into Jerusalem and on into the temple where Jesus started driving out the sellers and the buyers that were trading in there. Then he tipped over the tables¦32312 of the money-changers and the chairs of the ones selling doves,
\v 16 and stopped others from carrying goods through the temple.
\v 17 \x + \xo 11:17: a \xt Isa 56:7; \xo b \xt Jer 7:11.\x*He said, “Isn't it written in the Scriptures,
\q1 ‘My house will be known as a house of prayer for all the nations’?
\m But all of you have turned it into a sanctuary for swindlers.”
\p
\v 18 When the chief priests¦32370 and the religious teachers heard this, they started looking for a way that they could destroy him, because they were afraid of him and the way that the crowd marvelled at this teaching.
\p
\v 19 Every evening, Jesus and his apprentices would go out of the city¦32407 to stay overnight.
\s1 Jesus gives a lesson on moving mountains
\r (Mat. 21:20-22)
\p
\v 20 As they¦32416 entered the city again in the morning, Jesus' apprentices noticed that the fig¦32418 tree¦32418 was totally dead.
\v 21 Peter remembered what he had said to the tree, and commented, “Teacher, that fig¦32432 tree that you cursed has withered up.”
\p
\v 22 Jesus responded, “Use your faith¦32445 in God.
\v 23 \x + \xo 11:23: \xt Mat 17:20; 1Cor 13:2.\x*I can assure you¦32451 that if anyone tells a mountain to go into the sea¦32467 and doesn't doubt in their mind but believes that what they're saying¦32450 will happen, then it¦32470 will.
\v 24 So I tell you all that anything you ask God for in your prayers, if you believe that you have received¦32508 it, then you will.
\v 25 \x + \xo 11:25-26: \xt Mat 6:14-15.\x*Whenever you are standing praying, if you have something against someone, be sure to forgive them so that your father¦32531 in heaven can also forgive your shortcomings.”
\s1 The leaders question Jesus' authority
\r (Mat. 21:23-27; Luk. 20:1-8)
\p
\v 26 ≈
\v 27 They continued on into Jerusalem¦32568 and on to the temple where they¦32564 were met by the chief priests¦32579 and the religious teachers and the elders.
\v 28 They asked Jesus, “Do you have any authority to do what you did? If so, who gave it to you?”
\p
\v 29 Jesus answered, “Ok, I'll also ask you something and when you answer me I'll tell you about my authority¦32637 to do that:
\v 30 When John \add preached and\add* immersed people, did the authority for that come from heaven¦32648 or from people here?”
\p
\v 31 They discussed this among themselves, reasoning, “If we say¦32668 it was from heaven¦32670, he'll ask us why we didn't believe him.
\v 32 But we can't say¦32683 that it was just from people.” (They said that because they were scared of the crowds, knowing that they believed that John was a prophet.)
\v 33 So they¦32710 answered, “We don't know.”
\p And Jesus also responded, “Well then, I won't tell you¦32724 about my authority¦32729 to do those things¦32731 either.”

\s1 The parable about the tenants killing the owner's son
\r (Mat. 21:33-46; Luk. 20:9-19)
\p
\v 1 \x + \xo 12:1: \xt Isa 5:1-2.\x*Then he started telling them some parables: “A man¦32742 planted a vineyard and put a fence and a moat around it and built a \add security\add* tower. Then he rented it out and went off travelling.
\v 2 At harvest time, he sent a slave to go to the tenant farmers and get his \add percentage\add* of the harvest.
\v 3 But the tenants grabbed the slave and beat him up, then sent¦32797 him back empty-handed.
\v 4 The owner sent¦32803 a second slave, but they¦32812 insulted this one and struck him on the head.
\v 5 So the owner sent a third slave and they murdered him. He sent many other slaves—some they just beat up and others they murdered.
\v 6 But the owner still had his one, dearly loved son, so finally he sent¦32856 him to go, thinking that they would now be convinced because it was his son.
\v 7 But the tenant farmers¦32874 said¦32882 to each others, ‘Ah ha. This is the one who will inherit this land. If we kill \em him\em*, we'll be the ones to control the estate.’
\v 8 So they took him and killed him, and threw the body outside the vineyard fence.
\p
\v 9 “Now, what do you think the owner of the vineyard will do? Yes, he'll come and eliminate those \add evil\add* tenants, and give the contract to others.
\v 10 \x + \xo 12:10-11: \xt Psa 118:22-23.\x*Haven't you all read this in the scriptures:
\q1 ‘the stone¦32931 that the builders rejected
\q1 became the \add important\add* cornerstone
\q1
\v 11 that was given by the master,
\q1 and we think it's incredible.’?”
\p
\v 12 And those leaders tried to arrest him because they knew¦32959 that it was them that the parable was addressed to, but they couldn't do it because \add Jesus had the favour\add* of the crowd, so they just left the area.
\s1 Jesus answers about payment of taxes
\r (Mat. 22:15-22; Luk. 20:20-26)
\p
\v 13 Then the religious leaders sent some members of the Pharisee party and¦32981 some of the \add political\add* supporters of King Herod to try to catch Jesus out.
\v 14 So they \add flattered\add* him, “Teacher, we know that you are honest even if it upsets others, and that you teach the truth¦33022 about God without caring about people's opinions. Is it legal \add for us Jews\add* to pay the poll tax to the Roman emperor or not? How should we handle this?”
\p
\v 15 But knowing their hypocrisy, Jesus responded to them, “Why are you¦33059 trying to test me? Bring me a coin so we can determine the proper answer.”
\p
\v 16 When they brought him a coin, he asked, “Whose image and inscription are on this coin?”
\p And they said, “The emperor's.”
\p
\v 17 “Well then,” said Jesus, “give to the emperor whatever is due him, but give God what is owed to God.”
\p And they had to admit that that was an outstanding answer.
\s1 Jesus explains that those who've died are alive
\r (Mat. 22:23-33; Luk. 20:27-40)
\p
\v 18 \x + \xo 12:18: \xt Acts 23:8.\x*Another time, members of the Sadducee sect came to Jesus and¦33127 asked,
\v 19 \x + \xo 12:19: \xt Deu 25:5.\x*“Teacher, Moses wrote that if a man's married brother should die before his wife without having any children¦33155, then his brother should marry her to produce descendants in his brother's name.
\v 20 Now what if there were seven¦33175 brothers¦33177 and the first one got married and died childless.
\v 21 So then the second brother took her in, but again died childless, and then the third.
\v 22 Eventually all seven¦33220 brothers died childless, and finally the woman¦33232 also died.
\v 23 Now, at the resurrection of the dead, which brother will she be the wife of, because at some point, she was married to each of the seven of them?”
\p
\v 24 So Jesus answered, “Actually you're all quite wrong, because you ignore the scriptures and also because you haven't experienced God's power.
\v 25 When the dead¦33280 do come back to life, they won't be getting engaged or married, but will be like the angels¦33296 in heaven.
\v 26 \x + \xo 12:26: \xt Exo 3:6.\x*And as for the state of those who've died, didn't you¦33310 read in the scriptures about Moses when God spoke¦33324 to him¦33325 in front of the \add burning\add* thorn bush and said, ‘I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob’?
\v 27 So God is not the God of the dead, but¦33347 of the living. You Sadducees are very wrong!”
\s1 Jesus answers about genuine obedience to God
\r (Mat. 22:34-40; Luk. 10:25-28)
\p
\v 28 Then one of the religious teachers who had heard their question and Jesus' excellent answer, came closer and asked, “Which of the commandments is the most important?”
\p
\v 29 \x + \xo 12:29-30: \xt Deu 6:4-5.\x*Jesus answered, “Well, the most important is this: ‘Listen, Israel. There's only one God who is our master.
\v 30 You must love God your master with all your heart¦33423 and with all your soul¦33430 and with all your mind and with all your strength.’
\v 31 \x + \xo 12:31: \xt Lev 19:18.\x*And the second is: ‘Love your neighbour like \add you look after\add* yourself.’ There's no other commandments more important than these.”
\p
\v 32 \x + \xo 12:32: \xt Deu 4:35.\x*The teacher replied to Jesus, “Yes, teacher, you're quite right saying there's only one God and¦33489 no other,
\v 33 \x + \xo 12:33: \xt Hos 6:6.\x* and saying that we should love him¦33498 with all our heart¦33502 and all our intelligence and all our strength, and to be loving our neighbours like we \add look after\add* ourselves, and all this is more important than all the required temple offerings and sacrifices.”
\p
\v 34 \x + \xo 12:28-34: \xt Luk 10:25-28.\x*When Jesus saw that he had given such a thoughtful answer, he said, “You are very close to the kingdom¦33556 of God!”
\p After that, no one else dared to ask¦33565 Jesus any more questions.
\s1 Jesus asks about the messiah being a descendant of David
\r (Mat. 22:41-46; Luk. 20:41-44)
\p
\v 35 Later when Jesus was teaching in the temple, he asked the people, “How is it that the teachers here say that the messiah is a descendant of King David?
\v 36 \x + \xo 12:36: \xt Psa 110:1.\x* Because David himself said under the inspiration of the holy spirit,
\q1 ‘The master told my master,
\q2 “Sit there in the position of honour
\q2 until I can conquer your enemies.” ’
\m
\v 37 If David calls him his master, how can he possibly be his descendant?”
\p The large crowd was very interested to hear everything that Jesus had to say.
\s1 Jesus warns about smartly-dressed teachers
\r (Mat. 23:1-36; Luk. 20:45-47)
\p
\v 38 As Jesus continued teaching, he said, “Watch out for these religious teachers who like to wear \add fancy\add* robes¦33674 and be greeted in the square,
\v 39 and have the best seats at meetings and the best places¦33688 at dinners.
\v 40 These people trick widows¦33699 out of their properties, but offer long prayers to cover it up. They will be getting a stricter judgement than others.”
\s1 The sacrificial donation of a widow
\r (Luk. 21:1-4)
\p
\v 41 As he sat down in front of the \add temple\add* treasury, Jesus watched the crowd as they threw coins into \add the dish\add*, and some rich people were donating quite valuable \add silver\add* coins.
\v 42 Then an impoverished widow¦33748 came and threw in two¦33752 small \add copper\add* coins.
\v 43 Jesus called his followers and told them, “Honestly, that poor widow¦33769 gave more than all the others.
\v 44 You see, most people donate from their excess wealth, but¦33798 this woman¦33797 even gave \add some of\add* the small amount that she¦33805 needed to live on.”
\c 13
\s1 Jesus predicts total destruction of the temple
\r (Mat. 24:1-2; Luk. 21:5-6)
\p
\v 1 As they were leaving the temple area, one of Jesus'¦33825 followers noted, “Teacher, look at these \add large\add* stones¦33828 and¦33829 the \add beautiful\add* buildings that they've been made into.”
\p
\v 2 But Jesus responded, “Yes, incredible buildings, but \add the time will come\add* when they're torn down—not a single stone¦33860 will be left sitting in its place.”
\s1 Jesus talks about coming hardships
\r (Mat. 24:3-14; Luk. 21:7-19)
\p
\v 3 Later when they were over on the Mount of Olives overlooking the temple, Peter and Jacob and John and Andrew were with Jesus and asked
\v 4 when all this destruction would happen, and¦33910 what indications there would be that it's about to happen.
\p
\v 5 So Jesus told them, “Be careful so that you¦33938 aren't mislead by others.
\v 6 Plenty of people will say that they're coming¦33943 under my authority, or that they're me, and¦33954 they'll mislead many others.
\v 7 And whenever you¦33960 hear about wars or about battles about to begin, don't be worried—these things will certainly happen, but¦33972 there's more to follow.
\v 8 Countries will take up arms against other countries, and kingdoms against other kingdom. There'll be earthquakes in \add many\add* places¦33989 and there'll be famines, but these will be just like the beginning of birth¦33997 pains.
\p
\v 9 \x + \xo 13:9-11: \xt Mat 10:17-20; Luk 12:11-12.\x*“So be careful. You'll be turned over to \add local\add* councils \add for questioning\add*, will be whipped in the religious meeting halls, and will be stood in front of governors and kings¦34024 because of following me. But you'll be able to present your life stories to them
\v 10 and it's right that the good¦34048 news first\f + \fr 13:10 \ft TD: It's not clear here what was meant by ‘first’—‘first’ before what?\f* be proclaimed to every country.
\v 11 But whenever they bring you along to hand¦34061 you over, don't worry in advance about what you're going to say to defend yourselves, but wait until the hearing proceeds and speak what you are given then, because then it won't be you speaking, but God's spirit.
\v 12 In those times, a brother will report on his brother to have him executed, and a father¦34100 report on his child, and children¦34106 will be encouraged to report on their own parents and then they'll be executed as a result.
\v 13 \x + \xo 13:13: \xt Mat 10:22.\x*And every one will hate you¦34113 all because they hate my name, but whoever endures to the end will be saved.
\s1 Jesus warns about coming horror and deceptions
\r (Mat. 24:15-28; Luk. 21:20-24)
\p
\v 14 \x + \xo 13:14: \xt Dan 9:27; 11:31; 12:11.\x*“But whenever you see¦34131 the most horrible thing that drives people from God, standing where it¦34149 shouldn't be (and you readers should understand this), then anyone in Judea should flee into the hills
\v 15 \x + \xo 13:15-16: \xt Luk 17:31.\x*and anyone upstairs looking outside shouldn't come down into the bedrooms to get anything,
\v 16 and anyone working outside shouldn't go back inside to get a change of clothes.
\v 17 It will be extremely difficult for pregnant women and for mothers who are breast-feeding their children in those days¦34216.
\v 18 Just pray that it¦34222 won't happen in the winter
\v 19 \x + \xo 13:19: \xt Dan 12:1; Rev 7:14.\x*because those days¦34231 will be terrible like nothing that's ever happened before, all the way back to when God created the world right until the present time¦34250, and¦34252 won't ever happen again.
\v 20 And if the master hadn't shortened that time, no humans would even survive, but he shortened that time so that the chosen ones could be saved.
\p
\v 21 So don't believe it¦34305 if you¦34291 hear someone say, ‘Look, the messiah has arrived here.’ or ‘There's the one that God has sent.’
\v 22 Plenty of fake messiahs and deceiving prophets will certainly come and even do things that humans can't normally do, so much so that even the chosen ones would defect if that were possible.
\v 23 So watch out, but I've warned you in advance about all of this.
\s1 The universe collapses as the son arrives
\r (Mat. 24:29-31; Luk. 21:25-28)

\v 25 \x + \xo 13:25: a \xt Isa 34:4; Rev 6:13; \xo b \xt Joel 2:10.\x*The stars¦34359 will fall down out of the sky¦34364 and the powers¦34371 in the heavens¦34377 will be shaken up.
\v 26 \x + \xo 13:26: \xt Dan 7:13; Rev 1:7.\x*Then the people will see mankind's child in the clouds coming¦34388 with incredible power¦34396 and¦34398 brightness.
\v 27 He'll send the angels¦34406 out to collect all the chosen people from the four¦34416 corners of the world, from everywhere between the earth and¦34408 the sky.
\s1 Watch out for the change in season
\r (Mat. 24:32-35; Luk. 21:29-33)
\p
\v 28 So learn¦34432 a lesson from fig¦34431 trees—whenever the branches green up and start sprouting leaves and then everyone knows that summer is close.
\v 29 So too whenever you see¦34462 all these things¦34464 happening, you know that the end \add of this current world\add* is close.
\v 30 I can assure you that the generation¦34484 of people who see these things won't die off before these latter things happen.
\v 31 The sky and¦34496 the planet might collapse, but¦34502 my teachings will never become irrelevant.
\s1 Stay alert for the coming of the master
\r (Mat. 24:36-44)
\p
\v 32 \x + \xo 13:32: \xt Mat 24:36.\x* But as for the date or time when all this will happen, only the father¦34534 knows that—even the son and angels¦34522 don't know.
\v 33 So watch out, observe current events, and¦34539 be praying, because you¦34542 won't know exactly when all this will happen.
\v 34 \x + \xo 13:34: \xt Luk 12:36-38.\x*It can all be compared to a man¦34558 who was about to leave his house¦34563 and go on a trip. Before he leaves, he gives certain jobs and responsibilities to his various slaves, and instructs his security guard to stay alert.
\v 35 So you all watch and stay alert, because you don't know when the master of the house¦34595 might return—perhaps one evening or at midnight, or at dawn or maybe mid-morning.
\v 36 You certainly don't want to be caught napping when he comes.
\v 37 And what I'm telling you¦34619 now, I tell everyone: stay alert and watch.”

\s1 The leaders plan to eliminate Jesus
\r (Mat. 26:1-5; Luk. 22:1-2; Jn 11:45-53)
\p
\v 1 \x + \xo 14:1: \xt Exo 12:1-27.\x*Now it was two¦34633 days¦34634 before the Passover Feast and the Feast of Flat Bread, and the chief priests¦34638 and the religious teachers were trying to figure out how they could have Jesus set up so they could arrest him and have him executed,
\v 2 but they¦34651 knew that the Feast wouldn't be a good time because the people¦34664 would protest in Jesus' favour.
\s1 The woman anoints Jesus for his burial
\r (Mat. 26:6-13; Jn 12:1-8)
\p
\v 3 \x + \xo 14:3: \xt Luk 7:37-38.\x*Meanwhile, Jesus was in Bethany at the home who Simon who had previously had leprosy. Jesus was sitting there when a woman¦34681 came¦34680 in with a hand-crafted container of very expensive fragrant oil. Breaking open the sealed flask, she¦34699 poured the fragrant oil over Jesus' head.
\v 4 Immediately some started quietly grumbling about the extravagant waste,
\v 5 then they¦34748 scolded the woman because a flask of genuine lotion like this could easily fetch almost a year's wages if it was sold.
\p
\v 6 But Jesus spoke up, “What do you think you're doing abusing her—leave her alone! She's done something very good¦34764 for me.
\v 7 \x + \xo 14:7: \xt Deu 15:11.\x*You'll always have poor people around, and you can help them whenever you want to, but I won't be around forever.
\v 8 She has performed the traditional anointing of my body¦34805 in advance of my burial.
\v 9 And I can assure you¦34813 that wherever the good¦34820 news is proclaimed around the world, what she has done today will be part of the story and she'll be remembered.
\s1 Judas offers to hand Jesus over
\r (Mat. 26:14-16; Luk. 22:3-6)
\p
\v 10 Then Judas Iscariot, one of the Jesus' twelve¦34846 \add trainees\add*, visited the chief priests¦34850 to offer to hand Jesus over to them.
\v 11 When they heard this, they were very pleased and promised to pay him well, and Judas asked them about the most convenient way for them to get hold of Jesus.
\s1 Jesus' trainees prepare the Passover meal
\r (Mat. 26:17-25; Luk. 22:7-14, 21-23)
\p
\v 12 On the first day¦34881 of the Feast of Flat Bread when the lambs would be slaughtered ready for the special Passover meal, Jesus' trainees asked him, “Where do you want us to get everything ready for our Passover meal?”
\p
\v 13 So Jesus sent off two¦34905 of them with these instructions, “Go into town and a man¦34926 carrying a pitcher of water¦34928 will meet you there. Just follow¦34930 him
\v 14 until he goes into a house. Then find the owner of the house and tell him that the teacher¦34942 wants to know the location of the guestroom where he and his trainees can celebrate the Passover meal.
\v 15 He'll show you a large, furnished room upstairs—that's where you can get everything ready.
\p
\v 16 So the two of them went off into the town, and everything happened there exactly as Jesus had told them, and so they prepared the special meal there.
\s1 Jesus shocks his trainees at the Passover meal
\r (Mat. 26:20-30; Luk. 22:14-23; Jn 13:21-30; 1 Kur. 11:23-25)
\p
\v 17 As the evening approached, Jesus went in for dinner with his twelve¦35005 trainees.
\v 18 \x + \xo 14:18: \xt Psa 41:9.\x*As they were sitting around eating, he told them, “I will tell you frankly that one of you eating with me here will hand me over \add to be arrested\add*.”
\v 19 That upset them, and¦35037 several of them individually asked, “Surely it couldn't be me?”
\p
\v 20 Then he continued, “It's one of the twelve¦35061—the one who dips his bread in the sauce at the same time as me.
\v 21 Indeed it's written \add in the scriptures\add* that mankind's child will be arrested, but on the other hand, what a tragedy it will be for the one who hands him over—in fact it would be better for that man if he was never born.”
\p
\v 22 As the carried on eating, he took a bread roll, blessed \add God\add*, broke the roll apart and gave a piece to them, saying, “Take this bread—it's my body¦35134.”
\p
\v 23 Then he picked up a cup, gave¦35141 thanks \add to God\add*, and passed it around so they could each drink from it,
\v 24 \x + \xo 14:24: a \xt Exo 24:8; \xo b \xt Jer 31:31-34.\x*saying, “This is the blood¦35156 of my contract that will be poured out for many \add people\add*.
\v 25 I can assure you¦35175 that I won't drink anything made from grapes until I drink new juice in God's kingdom.”
\p
\v 26 And after they'd sung some songs, they left the town and went across to the Mount of Olives.
\s1 Jesus predicts Peters denials
\r (Mat. 26:31-35; Luk. 22:31-34; Jn 13:36-38)
\p
\v 27 \x + \xo 14:27: \xt Zech 13:7.\x*Then Jesus continued his teaching, “All of you¦35218 will stumble because it's written in the scriptures: ‘I will strike down the shepherd¦35231 and¦35232 the sheep¦35236 will be scattered.’
\v 28 \x + \xo 14:28: \xt Mat 28:16.\x*But after I come back to life, I'll go on ahead of you¦35248 back to Galilee.”
\p
\v 29 But Peter contradicted him, “Even if everyone else stumbles, I won't!”
\p
\v 30 And Jesus responded, “I can assure you that you'll renounce me three times¦35292 this very night, before the rooster crows early tomorrow morning.”
\p
\v 31 But Peter argued forcibly, “Even if I had to die with you, I would never disown you!”
\p And all the others said similar things.
\s1 Jesus, in distress, prays at Gethsemane
\r (Mat. 26:36-46; Luk. 22:39-46)
\p
\v 32 They walked along until they came to a piece of land called Gethsemane where Jesus told his trainees to sit down while he prayed.
\v 33 He took Peter and Jacob and John further in with him¦35361 where he stared off in a daze but was obviously very distressed.
\v 34 He told the three of them, “My soul¦35375 is deathly sad! You guys just stay here and¦35381 keep alert.”
\p
\v 35 He went ahead a little way where he knelt on the ground with his head down and prayed—asking if it was possible to avoid what was ahead of him.
\v 36 But he said, “Father, I know that you can do anything. Let me avoid this suffering, but yes I know, it doesn't matter what I want¦35441 but what you've \add planned\add*.”
\p
\v 37 Then he went back and found the others sleeping. He asked Peter, “Simon, are you asleep? Couldn't you stay awake even for a single hour?
\v 38 You all need to stay alert and be careful not to give into temptation. I know your spirits are enthusiastic on one hand, but it's still easy to give in to the moment.”
\p
\v 39 Then he went further in again and prayed as before,
\v 40 but when he returned again, he found them all asleep because they were tired, but they couldn't really find any excuse to give.
\p
\v 41 The third time that Jesus returned, he said to them, “Ah, you're all sleeping again and having a good rest. It's well earned but the time has come for mankind's child to be handed over to evil men.
\v 42 Come on—get up—we need to go! Look, the one who'll hand me over is on his way.
\s1 Jesus is arrested in the night
\r (Mat. 26:47-56; Luk. 22:47-53; Jn 18:3-12)
\p
\v 43 Even while Jesus was still speaking, Judas reached him, followed by a crowd from the the chief priests¦35581, and the religious teachers, and the elders—many armed with swords¦35575 and clubs.
\v 44 Judas had prearranged a signal with them that whoever he greeted with a kiss¦35602, they should grab that person and lead him away under guard.
\p
\v 45 So he walked right up to Jesus¦35623 and said, “My honoured teacher,” and greeted him with a kiss.
\v 46 Then the others with him grabbed Jesus and secured him.
\v 47 But one of the ones with Jesus that was beside him, drew his sword¦35653 and¦35662 struck a slave¦35659 of the chief priest¦35661, cutting off the man's ear.
\v 48 Jesus spoke to the crowd, “Did¦35672 you all bring swords¦35681 and¦35682 clubs to try to capture me like you'd chase down a thief?
\v 49 \x + \xo 14:49: \xt Luk 19:47; 21:37.\x*I was standing there teaching in the temple every day¦35687 and you could have arrested me, but it's happened this way to ensure that the what's written in scriptures will be fulfilled.
\p
\v 50 Meanwhile, the ones with Jesus had taken off.
\v 51 One young fellow was wearing a single linen robe, and when the crowd tried to grab him,
\v 52 it came off \add in the struggle\add* and he ran away stark naked.
\s1 The mock trial where Jesus is sentenced to death
\r (Mat. 26:57-68; Luk. 22:54-55,63-71; Jn 18:13-14,19-24)
\p
\v 53 The guards led Jesus¦35753 away to the chief priest's residence, and all the chief priests¦35766 and the elders and the religious teachers gathered there also.
\v 54 Peter followed¦35781 along from a distance and went in as far as the courtyard of the residence where he joined the servants who were sitting around the fire¦35803 keeping warm.
\v 55 Inside, the chief priests¦35806 and all the council were trying to establish a case against Jesus¦35814 so he could be sentenced to death, but they weren't coming up with anything.
\v 56 Several were making up charges against him, but¦35833 none of the accusers' stories agreed with each other.
\p
\v 57 Eventually some of them stood up and offered this false charge:
\v 58 \x + \xo 14:58: \xt Jn 2:19.\x*“We heard him¦35852 say that he would demolish this temple made by many labourers, and within three¦35866 days¦35867 he'd build another one without any helpers.”
\v 59 But even then, they couldn't get their accusations to align with each other.
\p
\v 60 Nevertheless the chief priest¦35884 in the middle of the council stood up and asked¦35888 Jesus, “Aren't you going to defend yourself? These men¦35897 are accusing you of these things.”
\p
\v 61 But Jesus didn't say anything. So the chief priest¦35916 asked again, “Is it true that you're the chosen one that God promised to send—the son of the blessed \add God\add*?”
\p
\v 62 \x + \xo 14:62: \xt Dan 7:13.\x*Jesus replied, “I am. And you¦35948 will all see mankind's child sitting in the honoured postion by the powerful God and coming¦35960 through the clouds in the sky¦35967.”
\p
\v 63 Then the chief priest¦35970 tore his own robe \add to show his disgust\add* and shouted, “We certainly don't need any more witnesses now!
\v 64 \x + \xo 14:64: \xt Lev 24:16.\x*You yourselves all heard him¦36005 insult God. What sentence does that deserve?”
\p So the leaders there agreed that Jesus needed to be sentenced to death.
\p
\v 65 Then various people started spitting on him, and blindfolding him and beating him saying, “Ha, tell us who that was!” Even the servants joined in to slap him.
\s1 The pegpahunware of Pidru concerning of Jesus
\r (Mat. 26:69-75; Luk. 22:56-62; Jn 18:15-18,25-27)
\p
\v 66 Meanwhile, Peter¦36052 was down in the courtyard when one of the chief priest's servant¦36063 girl came out,
\v 67 and seeing Peter warming himself, she¦36075 looked more closely and said, “Hey, you were with that Jesus from Nazareth!”
\p
\v 68 But he denied it, “I don't know him and I don't know why you think I would!” And he moved away from the fire.
\p
\v 69 But the girl¦36121 that had seen¦36122 him¦36123 said to some of the others standing around, “That guy's one of them.”
\p
\v 70 But again Peter denied it.
\p A little while later, some of those standing there said, “You must be one of them because you're from Galilee.”
\p
\v 71 Now Peter started swearing and cursing and said, “I've never even met that fellow that you're all talking about!”
\p
\v 72 And right then the rooster crowed for the second time. Peter remembered now what Jesus had told him—how he would renounce Jesus three times¦36222 before the rooster crows—and he broke down and cried.

\s1 Pilate tries to interrogate Jesus
\r (Mat. 27:1-2,11-14; Luk. 23:1-5; Jn 18:28-38)
\p
\v 1 First thing in the morning, the chief priests¦36242 called a meeting with the elders and the religious teachers and all the council, and they ordered that Jesus be tied up and taken over to Governor Pilate.
\v 2 There Pilate asked¦36270 him, “Are you the king¦36278 of the Jews?”
\p “You said it,” replied Jesus.
\p
\v 3 Then the chief priests¦36295 started hurling accusations against Jesus.
\v 4 So Pilate asked¦36305 him¦36307 again, “Don't you have anything to say? Listen to all these accusations they're making against you.”
\p
\v 5 But Pilate was astounded that Jesus didn't answer any further.
\s1 Pilate agrees to execute an innocent man
\r (Mat. 27:15-26; Luk. 23:13-25; Jn 18:39–19:16)
\p
\v 6 Now at time of the Jewish Passover, Pilate would normally pardon one prisoner for them and release him.
\v 7 There was another prisoner at the time named Barabbas¦36352 who was an activist accused of murder.
\v 8 By now, the crowd had arrived and asked Pilate to release a prisoner as usual at Passover.
\v 9 So he asked them, “Do you want me to release the King of the Jews for you?”
\v 10 This was because Pilate was well aware that the chief priests¦36407 had brought Jesus because they were jealous of his \add popularity\add*.
\v 11 But the chief priests¦36410 stirred up the crowd to start saying that it was Barabbas¦36421 that they wanted released.
\v 12 So Pilate asked again, “Then what should I do with this man that you¦36438 call the King of the Jews?”
\p
\v 13 The crowd yelled back, “Execute him¦36451 on a pole.”
\p
\v 14 Pilate demanded, “What has he¦36460 even done wrong?”
\p But they¦36462 just yelled louder, “Execute him¦36470 on a pole!”
\p
\v 15 Now Pilate wanted to placate the crowd, so he had Barabbas released while he had Jesus flogged and then handed over to the execution squad.
\s1 The battalion plays with their mock “king”
\r (Mat. 27:27-31; Jn 19:2-3)
\p
\v 16 So the soldiers¦36501 led Jesus inside the palace that was the governor's residence, and¦36513 called in the rest of the battalion.
\v 17 They \add mocked Jesus\add* by dressing him in a kingly robe, and after someone twisted some thorns together into a mock crown, they pressed it onto his head,
\v 18 and began saluting him, “Greetings, King of the Jews.”
\v 19 They took turns whacking his head with a stick and spitting on him, while others knelt down in front of him and pretended to be bowing to him.
\v 20 After they'd finished having fun mocked him, they took the purple robe off him, and put his own robe back on him. Then they led him outside towards the execution spot.
\s1 Jesus is publicly executed along with thieves
\r (Mat. 27:32-44; Luk. 23:26-43; Jn 19:17-27)
\p
\v 21 \x + \xo 15:21: \xt Rom 16:13.\x*As they walked out of the city, they came across a man¦36592 coming¦36598 in from the country¦36601. He was Simon from Cyrene, the father¦36603 of Alexander and Rufus, and the soldiers forced him¦36611 to carry the execution pole,
\v 22 and so they¦36614 all arrived at Golgotha (which means “Place of the skull”).
\v 23 There the soliders went to give some spiced wine to Jesus, but¦36639 he declined it.
\v 24 \x + \xo 15:24: \xt Psa 22:18.\x*So they¦36647 carried out the execution, taking Jesus' clothes and¦36657 drawing straws to see who would get what.
\v 25 By now it¦36660 was 9am, and¦36665 they¦36667 affixed Jesus to the pole.
\v 26 The charge had been written out and attached \add at the top\add*: “The King of the Jews.”
\v 27 That morning, two¦36690 thieves were also executed there—one on each side of Jesus.
\p
\v 28 ≈
\v 29 \x + \xo 15:29: a \xt Psa 22:7; 109:25; \xo b \xt Mrk 14:58; Jn 2:19.\x*As people passed by on the path, they insulted Jesus, shaking their heads and shouting, “Hoy there! You who reckoned you¦36726 could demolish the temple and rebuild it¦36731 in three¦36733 days¦36734.
\v 30 Come down from that pole and save¦36736 yourself.”
\p
\v 31 Similarly the chief priests¦36748 and the religious teachers laughed together and mocked, “He did miracles for others, but he can't even save¦36762 himself.
\v 32 The so-called ‘chosen one’ or ‘King of Israel’. Now, if he'd just come¦36769 down from there, then we'd be able to believe him.”
\p Even the other two being executed with him were deriding him.
\s1 Jesus breathes his last
\r (Mat. 27:45-56; Luk. 23:44-49; Jn 19:28-30)
\p
\v 33 At noon, it got dark everywhere, until 3pm,
\v 34 \x + \xo 15:34: \xt Psa 22:1.\x*when Jesus shouted loudly, “My God, my God, why have you¦36837 abandoned me?”
\p
\v 35 Some of the people standing nearby thought he was calling the prophet Elijah.
\v 36 \x + \xo 15:36: \xt Psa 69:21.\x*One of them ran, and soaked a sponge in some sour wine, then put it on a stick and held it up for Jesus to drink, saying, “Hang on. Let's see¦36875 if Elijah does come to get him down.”
\p
\v 37 But just then Jesus¦36883 uttered a loud¦36886 cry and exhaled his last breath.
\p
\v 38 \x + \xo 15:38: \xt Exo 26:31-33.\x*(Back in the temple, the curtain tore down the middle from the top to the bottom.)
\v 39 The Roman centurion who had been standing back watching everything, said¦36921 when Jesus died, “This man was definitely God's son.”
\p
\v 40 \x + \xo 15:40-41: \xt Luk 8:2-3.\x*Further back, there was also a group of women¦36936 observing everything. These included Mary from Magdala, Mary the mother¦36959 of young Jacob and Joses, and Salome,
\v 41 and others who had followed Jesus around Galilee and helped look after him, along with many others who had come¦36981 down with him to Jerusalem.
\s1 Joseph boldly lays the body in a burial chamber
\r (Mat. 27:57-61; Luk. 23:50-56; Jn 19:38-42)
\p
\v 42 As evening came, it was now the Preparation Day, i.e., the day before the Rest Day.
\v 43 Joseph (who'd come¦37000 from the city of Arimathea and one who was waiting for the coming of God's kingdom), a prominent council member, steeled himself¦37012 up and went in to see the governor to get permission to transfer Jesus' body¦37029.
\v 44 Governor Pilate didn't think he'd be dead yet, so he called an army commander to find out if Jesus had indeed died.
\v 45 As soon as he found out, he gave Joseph¦37068 permission.
\v 46 So Joseph \add and his companions\add* went and bought some linen burial cloth and then, removing Jesus' body from the pole, wrapped it in the cloth and placed it in a burial chamber that had been chiseled into a rockface. Then they rolled a rock across the opening.
\v 47 Others were watching and noted where the body had been laid, including Mary from Magdala and Mary the mother¦37122 of Joses.
\c 16
\s1 The massive shock at the burial chamber
\r (Mat. 28:1-8; Luk. 24:1-12; Jn 20:1-10)
\p
\v 1 After the Rest Day was over, Mary from Magdala and Mary the mother¦37148 of Jacob and Salome, went and bought some traditional burial spices that evening to take to the burial chamber and place with the body.
\v 2 Then very early on Sunday morning they¦37172 went to the chamber, arriving just as the sun¦37181 was rising.
\v 3 But they realised that they didn't have anyone with them to roll the rock away that was covering the entrance.
\v 4 However, when they looked¦37204 they saw that the very large rock had already been rolled away.
\v 5 So they went on into the burial chamber and were toally stunned to find a young man¦37234 dressed in white, sitting in there on the side.
\p
\v 6 He assured them, “Don't be surprised. I know you're looking for Jesus from Nazareth, the one who was executed on a pole. But see¦37272 there where his body was—he's not there because he came back to life.
\v 7 \x + \xo 16:7: \xt Mat 26:32; Mrk 14:28.\x*So you three should go and tell his trainees, and Peter in particular, that he's going to go up ahead of them to Galilee and you'll all see him up there, just as he already told you.”
\p
\v 8 So they left the chamber and took off running, still stunned and shaking and too scared to stop and to talk to anyone.
\rem It's not certain whether or not the following longer ending of this document was actually penned by Mark, or whether it was appended slightly later. Expert scholars are divided on this, and hence it's included here for your consideration:
\s1 \add The others don't believe that Mary saw Jesus\add*
\r (Mat. 28:9-10; Jn 20:11-18)
\v 9 \add After coming back to life early on Sunday morning, Jesus appeared first to Mary from Magdala. (She was the one that he had once commanded seven demons to leave.)\add*
\v 10 \add After leaving him, she went and told his followers who were mourning and weeping at his loss.\add*
\v 11 \add But when she told them that he is alive again and that she'd seen him, they simply didn't believe her.\add*
\s1 \add Jesus appears to two of his followers\add*
\r (Luk. 24:13-35)
\p
\v 12 \add Later on, Jesus appeared in a different form to two of his followers on the path as they left Jerusalem and headed out to the countryside,\add*
\v 13 \add but when they hurried back and told the others, no one believed them.\add*
\s1 \add Jesus appears to his trainees and instructs them\add*
\r (Mat. 28:16-20; Luk. 24:36-49; Jn 20:19-23; Acts 1:6-8)
\p
\v 14 \add Later again when the eleven trainees were sitting around eating, Jesus appeared in the room and scolded them for not believing and for being so stubborn when they hadn't believed others who had told them that he'd come back from the dead.\add*
\v 15 \x + \xo 16:15: \xt Acts 1:8.\x*\add Then he instructed them, “Travel around all the world and tell the good news to everyone.\add*
\v 16 \add Anyone who believes and gets immersed in water will be saved, however, those who refuse to believe will be condemned to death.\add*
\v 17 \add Those who believe will be able to do miracles: they'll be able to use my authority to command demons to leave and to speak new languages,\add*
\v 18 \add and they'll be able to pick up snakes. If they drink anything poisonous, it won't hurt them, and they will place their hands on people and make them better.\add*
\s1 \add Jesus is lifted up to heaven\add*
\r (Luk. 24:50-53; Acts 1:9-11)
\p
\v 19 \x + \xo 16:19: \xt Acts 1:9-11.\x*\add When Jesus had finished speaking, he was lifted up into heaven and seated in the honoured place next to God.\add*
\v 20 \add Then his followers went around preaching everywhere, and God worked through them and so they were able to confirm the truth of their preaching by doing miracles.\add*
