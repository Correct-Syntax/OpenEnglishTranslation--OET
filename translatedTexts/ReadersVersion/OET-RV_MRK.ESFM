\mt2 The account of Yeshua's ministry by
\mt1 Mark
\is1 Introduction
\is2 Author
\ip This account about the works and teachings of Yeshua was written by Mark, the son of a Jewish family who lived in Jerusalem. His mother was named Mary (Acts 12:12).
\ip Many people think he was John Mark, a cousin of Barnabas (Col. 4:10) who accompanied Paul on his first long-distance trip to spread the good news about Yeshua the messiah (Acts 12:25, 13:13). We also know that Mark accompanied Peter (1 Peter 5:13), and some consider that it might have been Peter who narrated to Mark what Yeshua had done and taught.
\is2 This account
\ip This account seems to have been written for non-Jews, especially perhaps those familiar with Roman customs. So he didn't use as much ink as Matthew or Luke explaining prophecies from the Jewish scriptures but he does however, take time to explain Jewish customs to help non-Jewish readers.
\ip Mark explains here that Yeshua came to serve both God and the people, and he often refers to him as ‘mankind's child’ (traditionally translated very literally from the Greek as the ‘Son of Man’). We can see that especially in 10:45: “Even mankind's child didn't come to be served, but to serve others and to give his life as a ransom to set many people free.” Mark wants his readers to know that Yeshua did incredible things, but especially focuses on his teaching. He confirms the power and authority of Yeshua by telling about the miracles that he did, his healing of the sick, and his exorcism of demons.
\ip The ending of this account is often disputed, and scholars are still <a href="https://textandcanon.org/a-case-for-the-longer-ending-of-mark">debating</a> about whether or not the longer ending (16:9-20) is original. The \em OET\em* includes the disputed longer ending, but displays it in a lighter colour to indicate its debatable status.

\v 1 Here begins¦21751 the good¦21753 news about Yeshua¦21754 the messiah¦21756—the son of God¦21759:
\s1 The ministry of John the immerser (The return of ‘Elijah’)
\r (Mat. 3:1-12; Luk. 3:1-18; Jhn. 1:19-28)
\p
\v 2 \x + \xo 1:2: \xt Mal 3:1.\x*The prophet¦21771 Isaiah wrote:
\q1 “See, I am sending¦21774 my¦21778 messenger¦21777 to you,
\q1 the one who will be preparing¦21783 your¦21781 path.
\q1
\v 3 \x + \xo 1:3: \xt Isa 40:3 (LXX).\x*The voice¦21789 out in the wilderness¦21793 shouting¦21790,
\q2 ‘Get the path ready for the master¦21797;
\q2 Make it smooth for him¦21803 to travel on.’ ”
\p
\v 4 John turned up in the wilderness¦21885 announcing that people should get immersed¦21882 in water in order to show that their¦21893 sins¦21893 have been forgiven¦21892.
\v 5 And many from the Judean region¦21901 and from the city of Jerusalem went out to hear him, and they confessed¦21917 their¦21920 sins¦21919 and asked John to immerse¦21907 them in the Jordan river¦21914.
\p
\v 6 \x + \xo 1:6: \xt 2Ki 1:8.\x*John¦21925 was dressed¦21926 in simple clothes made from camel¦21929 hair with a leather¦21932 belt¦21931 around¦21933 his¦21936 waist¦21935, and he¦21934 lived on locusts¦21941 and wild honey¦21943.
\v 7 And he also announced, “There's a greater man coming¦21956 soon—in fact I'm not even good enough to bend down and untie¦21971 his¦21974 sandals¦21976.
\v 8 I immersed¦21981 you in water¦21984, but he will immerse¦21981 you all in God's pure spirit¦21993.”
\s1 Yeshua gets immersed and then tempted
\r (Mat. 3:13–4:11; Luk. 3:21-22; 4:1-13)
\p
\v 9 Then one day Yeshua¦22006 came from Nazareth¦22008 in the Galilee¦22010 region, and he got immersed¦22012 in the Jordan river by John.
\v 10 As Yeshua came up out of the water¦22029, he saw¦22030 the sky being¦22031 opened up, and God's spirit¦22037 coming¦22045 down on him like a dove¦22044.
\v 11 \x + \xo 1:11: \xt Gen 22:2; Psa 2:7; Isa 42:1; Mat 3:17; 12:18; Mrk 9:7; Luk 3:22.\x*And a voice¦22053 came¦22054 from the sky saying, “You are my¦22064 son who I love and am pleased¦22070 with.”
\p
\v 12 And then the spirit¦22076 sent him¦22079 into the wilderness¦22084
\v 13 where he was tested by Satan¦22098 for forty¦22092 days¦22093. He was out there with the wild animals, but angels¦22106 waited on him there.
\s1 The selection of the first followers / apprentices
\r (Mat. 4:12-22; Luk. 4:14-15; 5:1-11)
\p
\v 14 After John had been arrested, Yeshua went back up to Galilee¦22122 announcing the good¦22125 news from God
\v 15 \x + \xo 1:15: \xt Mat 3:2.\x*saying¦22131, “The promised time¦22137 is here, and God's kingdom¦22142 is now near. Turn from your sins and believe¦22149 this good¦22152 news.”
\p
\v 16 As he went around the lake of Galilee¦22161, Yeshua saw¦22162 two fishermen¦22184, Simon and his¦22171 brother¦22168 Andrew¦22166 throwing¦22172 a net¦22172 into the lake.
\v 17 And he¦22188 said¦22186 to them, “Come with me and¦22193 I will make¦22194 you¦22195 into fishermen¦22198 of people¦22199.”
\v 18 And so they¦22208 left their¦22205 fishing work and went off with Yeshua.
\p
\v 19 Then a bit further on he saw¦22216 two of Zebedee's¦22220 sons, Jacob and his¦22225 brother¦22224 John, in a boat¦22230 getting their¦22225 nets¦22233 ready.
\v 20 Yeshua called¦22237 them and they¦22256 too went¦22256 off with him¦22259, leaving their¦22244 father¦22243 Zebedee¦22245 in the boat¦22249 with the hired¦22252 workers.
\s1 Yeshua drives out a demon
\r (Luk. 4:31-37)
\p
\v 21 They went on into Capernaum where he went into the meeting hall and began teaching¦22279 as soon as the Sabbath started.
\v 22 \x + \xo 1:22: \xt Mat 7:28-29.\x*The congregation was amazed at his¦22286 teaching, because he taught with authority¦22292, not like the regular teachers there.
\p
\v 23 Then a demon-possessed man¦22308 in the meeting hall suddenly yelled out,
\v 24 “What are we to you, Yeshua of Nazareth¦22323? You've come to destroy¦22326 us. I know that you're God's holy one.”
\p
\v 25 But Yeshua¦22342 scolded it, saying¦22344, “Keep quiet!”, and, “Come out of him!”
\p
\v 26 Then the demon threw the man into a convulsion¦22357, cried out loudly, and left him.
\v 27 Everyone was astounded and asked each other, “What just happened? We haven't heard anything like this before—he has authority¦22408 to command¦22419 demons, and they obey him!”
\p
\v 28 And the news about Yeshua spread all over the entire region¦22434 of Galilee¦22437.
\s1 Yeshua heals many others
\r (Mat. 8:14-17; Luk. 4:38-41)
\p
\v 29 After leaving the meeting hall, Yeshua went into the home of Simon and Andrew¦22456, along with Jacob and John.
\v 30 Inside, Simon's mother-in-law¦22465 was lying¦22467 down with a fever¦22468, and the others spoke to Yeshua about¦22474 her.
\v 31 When he went up to her, and took hold of her hand¦22484 and helped her up, the fever¦22497 left her and she¦22500 prepared something for them to eat.
\p
\v 32 That evening¦22504 when the sun¦22511 set, the people brought all those who were sick or demon-possessed¦22524 to Yeshua.
\v 33 It seemed like the entire town had gathered¦22531 there outside the front door¦22537.
\v 34 Yeshua healed¦22561 many who were sick from a range of diseases¦22566, and he commanded many demons to leave—not allowing¦22576 them to speak¦22580 because¦22581 they knew that he was the messiah¦22585.
\s1 Yeshua prays before going preaching
\r (Luk. 4:42-44)
\p
\v 35 In the small hours of the morning, Yeshua got up and went¦22596 out to a quiet place¦22600 and prayed there¦22601.
\v 36 But Simon¦22613 and the others came looking for him,
\v 37 and when they found¦22620 him they said, “Everyone's looking for you!”
\p
\v 38 And Yeshua answered, “Well, we'll be going¦22637 into the other villages¦22645 around here, so that I can also tell them. That's what I came¦22662 here for.”
\v 39 \x + \xo 1:39: \xt Mat 4:23; 9:35.\x*Then he went preaching in all their¦22675 meeting halls in Galilee¦22679 and driving out demons¦22682.
\s1 Yeshua heals a man with leprosy
\r (Mat. 8:1-4; Luk. 5:12-16)
\p
\v 40 A man with leprosy came to Yeshua asking him, “I know that you could heal me if you wanted to.”
\p
\v 41 Yeshua felt compassion¦22711 for him, reached out his¦22716 hand¦22715 and touched¦22717 him, and said, “Yes, I will. Get well.”
\v 42 Then immediately¦22729 the leprosy¦22737 disappeared and he was well again.
\v 43 So Yeshua sent¦22746 him away, but warned him:
\v 44 \x + \xo 1:44: \xt Lev 14:1-32.\x*“Don't talk to anyone—just go to the priest¦22764 and show him¦22751 that you're well, and as a testimony¦22779 of that, make the offering¦22766 that Moses commanded¦22776.”
\p
\v 45 But after the man left, he started telling lots of people and spreading¦22789 the news—so much so that Yeshua could no longer¦22793 come into the town but had to stay out in quieter places¦22809, and people kept coming¦22812 to him.
\c 2
\s1 Yeshua heals a paralysed man
\r (Mat. 9:1-8; Luk. 5:17-26)
\p
\v 1 When Yeshua came back to Capernaum after a few days¦22826, people soon heard¦22828 that he was back in the house¦22832.
\v 2 And so many people turned up there that there wasn't any room left—not even in the doorway. Inside, Yeshua was explaining the Scriptures to them.
\v 3 Four men arrived, carrying a paralysed¦22865 man to Yeshua,
\v 4 but because¦22878 of the crowd¦22882, they were unable to get close. So they climbed up onto the flat roof, made a hole through it¦22892, and lowered¦22893 the paralysed¦22904 man lying¦22905 on a pallet¦22895.
\v 5 Yeshua, observing their¦22914 faith¦22913, said to the man, “Son, your¦22924 sins¦22927 are forgiven¦22921!”
\p
\v 6 But some of the religious teachers were sitting¦22935 there¦22934, thinking to themselves,
\v 7 “Why's he talking like that? He's seriously insulting God. There's only one who can forgive¦22952 sins¦22955, and that's God himself.”
\p
\v 8 Then Yeshua¦22966, knowing in his¦22970 spirit¦22969 that they¦22975 are thinking like that, said to them, “Why are you¦22989 thinking that to yourselves?
\v 9 Which¦22990 is easier¦22993: to tell the paralysed¦22996 man that his sins¦23003 have been forgiven¦22999, or to tell him to pick up his bedding and walk?”
\v 10 But¦23040 so you all can see that mankind's child \em does\em* have authority¦23034 here on the earth¦23045 to forgive¦23046 sins¦23047, he turned and said to the paralysed¦23050 man,
\v 11 “Listen. Get up, take¦23057 your¦23061 bedding, and¦23062 go home¦23066!”
\p
\v 12 So the man stood up, and picked up his bedding, and went out of the house where everyone saw¦23106 him and marvelled¦23090 and praised God saying¦23100, “We've never¦23105 seen anything happen like this before¦23085!”
\s1 The calling of Levi (Matthew)
\r (Mat. 9:9-13; Luk. 5:27-32)
\p
\v 13 Yeshua went out beside¦23117 the lake where crowds¦23124 of people kept coming¦23125 to him and he taught them.
\v 14 And as he was passing¦23133 by the tax office¦23145, he saw¦23134 Levi Alphaeus sitting¦23141 there and said to him, “Come along with me.” So Levi stood up and followed¦23154 Yeshua.
\p
\v 15 Yeshua ended up having a meal at Levi's place, and many other tax collectors¦23173 and undesirables were sitting there also, along with Yeshua's followers¦23182, because by then many were following¦23189 him around.
\v 16 And the teachers from the Pharisee party¦23199 noticed that Yeshua was eating beside undesirables and tax collectors. So they asked his¦23221 followers¦23220, “How come he eats with tax collectors and other low-life?”
\p
\v 17 And overhearing them, Yeshua¦23243 said, “Healthy people don't need a doctor¦23252—it's the sick ones that do. I didn't come here to help those who think they have no needs, but to call sinners¦23264.”
\s1 The question of fasting
\r (Mat. 9:14-17; Luk. 5:33-39)
\p
\v 18 Now the followers of John-the-Immerser and members of the Pharisees regularly fasted. So a small group came to Yeshua and asked, “How come John's followers and the Pharisee party fast regularly, yet your¦23297 followers don't?”
\p
\v 19 And Yeshua¦23306 answered, “Can the friends of the groom fast when they're celebrating along with him? No, as long as he's still there, they won't be fasting.
\v 20 But in the future, the groom will be taken¦23340 away from them, and¦23345 \em then\em* they'll be fasting¦23347.
\p
\v 21 “No one sews a patch of new, unshrunken¦23361 cloth¦23360 onto an old garment¦23366, because the new patch will tear away from that old fabric and it¦23378 will end up as a worse¦23387 tear.
\v 22 And no one puts new wine into old wineskins, because the wine will burst¦23410 the \add already stretched\add* wineskins, and then both the wine and the wineskins will be destroyed¦23424. New wine must be put into \em new\em* wineskins.”
\s1 Working on the Rest Day
\r (Mat. 12:1-8; Luk. 6:1-5)
\p
\v 23 \x + \xo 2:23: \xt Deu 23:25.\x*And it so happened that Yeshua and his¦23459 followers¦23458 passed through some fields¦23453 of grain on some days¦23445 of rest. As they went through, they plucked¦23464 off some heads¦23467 of grain.
\v 24 And some members of the Pharisee party¦23471 said, “It's breaking the law to harvest grain on a rest day!”
\p
\v 25 And Yeshua replied, “You've read yourselves what David did when him¦23514 and his men were hungry.
\v 26 \x + \xo 2:26: \xt Lev 24:9.\x*They went into God's tent and ate¦23535 the holy bread¦23531 representing the presence¦23533 of God. Only the priests¦23553 were allowed to eat¦23547 that, and yet David even gave¦23555 some to his¦23532 men!”
\v 27 And he told the Pharisees, “The days of rest were created for people, not people for the rest days.
\v 28 So I¦23588, mankind's child, have authority also over the day¦23591 of rest.”
\c 3
\s1 The man with the curled-up hand
\r (Mat. 12:9-14; Luk. 6:6-11)
\p
\v 1 And again¦23596 another time, Yeshua went to the meeting hall and there was a man¦23605 there with a curled-up hand¦23613.
\v 2 The religious leaders there were watching¦23615 him closely¦23615 to see if he would heal the man on the rest day, and then if he did, they would have a case against¦23629 him.
\v 3 Then Yeshua said to the man¦23633 with the flawed hand¦23639, “Stand up there in the middle.”
\v 4 And he asked the leaders, “Is it allowable to do good¦23667 on the rest day, or only to do evil¦23671? To save¦23674 life¦23673, or to kill¦23678?” But they didn't reply.
\p
\v 5 After angrily looking around¦23683 at them, grieving¦23688 at their¦23695 complete lack of compassion, he said to the man, “Open up your¦23695 hand!”
\v 6 The man stretched out his fingers, and his hand became totally normal. But the Pharisees quickly left, and meeting with King Herod's supporters¦23726, they conspired to kill Yeshua.
\s1 Big crowds press on Yeshua
\p
\v 7 After that, Yeshua withdrew¦23747 towards the lake with his¦23746 followers¦23745, and a huge crowd of people from the regions of both Galilee¦23759 and down in Judea,
\v 8 along with others from Jerusalem, Idumea, from across the Jordan River, and from up near Tyre and Sidon. They came¦23798 because they had heard about the amazing things he had done.
\v 9 \x + \xo 3:9-10: \xt Mrk 4:1; Luk 5:1-3.\x*So Yeshua asked his¦23806 apprentices¦23805 to organise a small boat¦23808 to be there for him so he wouldn't be cramped by the press of the crowd¦23814.
\v 10 Virtually anyone who had any physical issues was pressing¦23825 towards him to touch¦23832 him, because he¦23822 had already healed¦23822 so many.
\v 11 And the demons, whenever¦23844 they saw Yeshua, they fell down to the ground in front of him and yelled out, “You are God's son!”
\v 12 But he regularly warned them not to reveal who he was.
\s1 Yeshua appoints his twelve representatives
\r (Mat. 10:1-4; Luk. 6:12-16)
\p
\v 13 As Yeshua started climbing up a hill, he called the followers that he had selected, and they went¦23899 off with him.
\v 14 He appointed twelve¦23906 of them as his representatives so that they¦23914 could stick with him¦23917 and¦23922 be sent off to be proclaiming¦23927 his message
\v 15 and¦23930 to also have authority¦23934 to exorcise demons¦23941.
\p
\v 16 These are the twelve¦23950 that he appointed: Simon (but he appended the name¦23953 “Peter”),
\v 17 Jacob and his¦23971 brother¦23968 John who were Zebedee's¦23963 sons (and he nicknamed them the “sons of thunder¦23985”),
\v 18 Andrew¦23991, Philip, Bartholomew¦23999, Matthew¦24001, Thomas, Jacob Alphaeus, Thaddeus¦24014, Simon from Canaan,
\v 19 and¦24025 Judas Iscariot who later betrayed him¦24037.
\s1 The two opposing spiritual powers
\r (Mat. 12:22-32; Luk. 11:14-23; 12:10)
\p
\v 20 Then Yeshua was approaching a house¦24043, but the crowd¦24048 swarmed them again¦24046 so they had no opportunity to eat¦24057.
\v 21 The ones with him heard¦24060 all the noise and came¦24071 to get him, because they were wondering if he¦24062 was crazy.
\p
\v 22 \x + \xo 3:22: \xt Mat 9:34; 10:25.\x*The religious teachers had come¦24089 up from Jerusalem and were complaining, “He's possessed by the prince of demons. He can command them because he rules them!”
\p
\v 23 But Yeshua addressed them: “How could Satan¦24125 command himself?
\v 24 If a kingdom is divided¦24134 against¦24132 itself¦24133, that kingdom could never prosper.
\v 25 If a household is divided¦24147 against¦24145 itself¦24146, that family will never prosper.
\v 26 So if Satan¦24162 attacked himself¦24168 and was split, he¦24175 couldn't possibly be powerful, but his time would be over.
\p
\v 27 On the contrary, no one can enter the house of a strong man to clean out his¦24204 possessions unless he first¦24208 ties up that strong man—after that he can work on the goods¦24203.
\p
\v 28 Honestly, I assure you¦24223 that any sin of a person can be forgiven¦24226, no matter how much they¦24244 curse God.
\v 29 \x + \xo 3:29: \xt Luk 12:10.\x*But whoever¦24245 speaks against¦24251 the Holy Spirit can never be forgiven¦24258, but¦24262 is eternally¦24261 responsible for their sin¦24269.”
\v 30 (He said this because¦24271 they¦24272 were saying¦24272 that he was demon-possessed.)
\s1 Yeshua's mother and brothers arrive
\r (Mat. 12:46-50; Luk. 8:19-21)
\p
\v 31 Now Yeshua's mother¦24289 and brothers¦24293 came and were standing¦24297 outside¦24296 and asked someone to tell him that they were there.
\v 32 Some in the crowd¦24314 sitting¦24308 around¦24310 him told Yeshua that his¦24328 mother¦24323 and brothers¦24327 were waiting outside¦24333 for him.
\p
\v 33 But Yeshua answered¦24342, “Who is my mother¦24352 and¦24354 who are my brothers¦24357?”
\v 34 And having¦24360 looked¦24360 around at the people sitting¦24367 here, he said, “Actually, you all are my mother¦24375 and my brothers¦24379.
\v 35 For whoever¦24382 obeys God, that person is my brother¦24395 and my sister¦24398 and my mother¦24401.”
\c 4
\s1 The parable about planting seed
\r (Mat. 13:1-9; Luk. 8:4-8)
\p
\v 1 \x + \xo 4:1: \xt Luk 5:1-3.\x*Again Yeshua started teaching¦24407 by the edge of the lake. A huge crowd gathered¦24413 around him, but he had boarded¦24429 the boat¦24428 floating in the water, and all the people were there on the land.
\v 2 And he taught them many different things¦24464 in parables¦24463, including this one:
\v 3 “Listen. Once there was a farmer who went to spread some seed.
\v 4 As he spread it, some landed on the path, and the birds¦24500 came and feed on it.
\v 5 Some landed on a rocky¦24515 part without a lot of soil, and it¦24521 quickly sprouted in the warm, shallow soil,
\v 6 but when the sun¦24546 came up, it dried out because¦24550 the roots weren't deep, and so it just withered¦24555 up.
\v 7 Some of the seed landed in a thistle patch, and the thistles grew and choked¦24571 it out, so the plants never bore a crop.
\v 8 But some seed landing in fertile soil and it bore a harvest—some of it multiplying thirty¦24605 times, some sixty¦24611, and some a hundred¦24617 times.”
\p
\v 9 Then Yeshua added, “Whoever wants to understand, let them consider it.”
\s1 Why Yeshua speaks in parables
\r (Mat. 13:10-17; Luk. 8:9-10)
\p
\v 10 And when the crowd had left, the twelve¦24653 apprentices asked him about¦24648 the parables¦24659.
\v 11 And he told them, “You've been given¦24671 understanding about God's kingdom¦24673, but for others, they'll get it in parables¦24682
\q1
\v 12 \x + \xo 4:12: \xt Isa 6:9-10 (LXX).\x*so that when they look they might see but not perceive¦24693,
\q1 and when they listen, they might hear but not understand¦24700,
\q1 otherwise they might turn¦24703 \add from their sins\add* and be forgiven¦24705.”
\s1 Explaining about the ground where the seed fell
\r (Mat. 13:18-23; Luk. 8:11-15)
\p
\v 13 Then Yeshua said to them, “If you didn't understand this parable¦24717, how will you understand any others?
\v 14 The one spreading seed is spreading the Good News.
\v 15 And there are some along¦24737 the path where¦24741 the Good News is being¦24742 spread, who hear, but Satan¦24754 turns up immediately¦24750 and snatches the message from them.
\v 16 And similarly, there's some the falls onto rocky¦24782 places¦24782 where the people who hear¦24788 the Good News happily accept it¦24796,
\v 17 but don't make strong roots, just temporary¦24804 \add changes\add*. So when they get mocked or attacked about accepting the Good News, they quickly stumble¦24818.
\v 18 Others are the ones where the seed was spread among¦24827 the thistles. They heard¦24839 the Good News,
\v 19 but contemporary topics, or the lure of money, or the appetite for other¦24863 things¦24863 choke their¦24852 good intentions and the message¦24868 becomes¦24872 unfruitful¦24870 in them.
\v 20 But lastly, the seed that landed on the good¦24885 soil represents the people who hear the Good News, accept¦24894 it and are fruitful¦24896 thirty¦24901, sixty¦24905, or even a hundred¦24909 times over.”
\s1 The light will shine on everything
\r (Luk. 8:16-18)
\p
\v 21 \x + \xo 4:21: \xt Mat 5:15; Luk 11:33.\x*And Yeshua told them, “Obviously no one goes and gets a lamp, and then puts it under a basket¦24925 or under the bed, but rather places it somewhere higher on a stand.
\v 22 \x + \xo 4:22: \xt Mat 10:26; Luk 12:2.\x*You see, nothing is hidden¦24948 that won't eventually be disclosed, and¦24955 there's¦24946 no secret¦24957 that won't eventually be revealed¦24954.
\v 23 Anyone who wants to understand, let them listen carefully.”
\p
\v 24 \x + \xo 4:24: \xt Mat 7:2; Luk 6:38.\x*And he¦24972 continued, “Take care what you listen to. Because how much you judge others, so too will judgement be handed out to you, and even more.
\v 25 \x + \xo 4:25: \xt Mat 13:12; 25:29; Luk 19:26.\x*Whoever has \add faith\add* will be given¦24995 \add a reward\add*, but if you have none, even the little you have will be taken¦25005 away.”
\s1 The parable concerning the seed
\p
\v 26 And then, “God's kingdom¦25014 is like a person throwing¦25022 some seed onto the ground.
\v 27 Whether the person sleeps¦25033 at night or stays up night and day¦25041, the seed will sprout¦25045 and grow either way, and they don't know how it does it.
\v 28 The earth¦25058 is \add designed\add* to multiply the seed: first¦25060 a sprout appears, then a bigger plant, and then the full head of grain.
\v 29 \x + \xo 4:29: \xt Joel 3:13.\x*And when it's ripe, then the harvester¦25092 is sent in because¦25089 it's ready for harvest¦25092.”
\s1 The small seed produces a large result
\r (Mat. 13:31-32,34; Luk. 13:18-19)
\p
\v 30 Again he said, “What could we like God's kingdom¦25101 to? Or what parable¦25110 could we explain it with?
\v 31 It's like planting a mustard¦25121 seed in the ground—a very small¦25136 seed.
\v 32 But when it's planted¦25164 and grows up, it forms a large bush with many branches¦25170 so that birds¦25180 can rest in its shade.”
\p
\v 33 And so as much as they¦25195 could handle it, Yeshua shared the Good News with them via many similar word pictures.
\v 34 He never spoke without¦25199 these illustrations, but he explained¦25212 all of them to his close followers¦25210.
\s1 Yeshua halts the storm on the lake
\r (Mat. 8:23-27; Luk. 8:22-25)
\p
\v 35 It was already becoming¦25223 evening¦25222 on that day¦25221, so Yeshua said \add to his apprentices\add*, “Let's all go across¦25227 to the other shore.”
\v 36 So they left the crowd¦25233 behind and got into the boat¦25241 with him.
\v 37 \add Out in the lake\add* a big storm¦25259 came up with strong winds, and the waves¦25269 started breaking¦25272 across the boat and filling it.
\v 38 But Yeshua slept on in the back, sleeping¦25295 on a cushion¦25293. They woke him and cried, “Teacher¦25304, don't you care that we're all about to drown?”
\p
\v 39 Now awake, Yeshua scolded the wind and waves, “Quieten down! Stop that!” Then the wind died¦25327 down and the water became¦25331 very calm.
\v 40 And \add turning back to them\add* he¦25335 asked, “Why were you all so afraid? Don't you have any faith¦25347 yet?”
\p
\v 41 But now they were very afraid¦25349 \add again\add* and asked each other, “Who could this man be that both the wind and waves obey him¦25374?”
\c 5
\s1 Yeshua send the demons into the pigs
\r (Mat. 8:28-34; Luk. 8:26-39)
\p
\v 1 So they¦25377 got \add safely\add* to the region¦25390 of Gerasenes¦25392 on the other side of the lake.
\v 2 As Yeshua climbed out of the boat¦25404, a demon-possessed man¦25414 came out of the tombs¦25413 to meet him.
\v 3 He lived in those tombs¦25426, and¦25427 no one could tie him¦25438 up, not even with chains¦25430,
\v 4 because¦25442 he had often¦25445 been tied up in the past with shackles and chains but had always pulled the chains apart¦25458 and smashed the shackles, and no one was able to subdue him.
\v 5 All through¦25484 the day¦25489 and night¦25486, whether in the tombs¦25494 or up in the hills, he was yelling out and hurting himself¦25507 with stones¦25509.
\p
\v 6 So when he had seen¦25511 Yeshua¦25514 in the distance, he ran¦25517 and \add as a sign of honour\add* fell to the ground in front of him.
\v 7 Then he called out very loudly, “What will happen between us, Yeshua¦25534, the son of the highest¦25539 God? I beg you in God's name not to torment¦25547 me.”
\v 8 Because Yeshua had already started saying¦25549, “Come out of the man¦25563 you¦25555 ungodly spirit¦25556!”
\p
\v 9 Yeshua asked, “What's your¦25571 name?”
\p The man answered, “My name is ‘Thousands’ because¦25586 there's many of us,”
\v 10 and he begged Yeshua not to send¦25599 them out of the country¦25604.
\p
\v 11 It just so happened that there¦25607 was a large herd of pigs being¦25619 fed on the hill nearby
\v 12 and¦25624 they¦25625 begged Yeshua again saying¦25635, “Send us to the pigs so that we¦25646 can enter them.”
\v 13 Yeshua agreed to that, so the ungodly spirits¦25663 came out of the man, went into the pigs, and the entire herd of some two thousand¦25685 pigs rushed¦25673 down the steep¦25678 bank into the sea and were drowned¦25687.
\p
\v 14 The ones who had been feeding¦25694 them rushed off and spread the news around in the city¦25707 and the surrounding area. So the people hurried out to see¦25715 what had happened.
\v 15 When they arrived where Yeshua was, they saw the man who had been demon-possessed¦25731 fully-clothed and sitting¦25732 there in full control of his senses. They knew it was the man called ‘Thousands’ and they became frightened.
\v 16 Those who had seen¦25749 it all happen described¦25745 it all to the people—what had happened both to the demon-possessed¦25755 man and to the pigs.
\p
\v 17 So then the people began¦25761 asking Yeshua to go¦25766 away from their¦25771 region¦25770.
\p
\v 18 As Yeshua was climbing back into the boat¦25778, the man who had been demon-possessed¦25784 wanted to go with him.
\p
\v 19 But Yeshua wouldn't let him and told him to head back home¦25806 to his own people¦25810, and explain to them what the Master had done for him and how he had been merciful to him.
\p
\v 20 So he went¦25831 away and shared with the people of the Ten Cities region what Yeshua¦25844 had done for him, and they were all amazed.
\s1 A woman is healed as Yeshua goes to help a dying girl
\r (Mat. 9:18-26; Luk. 8:40-56)
\p
\v 21 When Yeshua¦25852 had crossed¦25849 in the boat¦25855 to the other side of the lake, a large crowd¦25865 of people came out to the lake edge to see him¦25869.
\v 22 A religious leader¦25881 named Jairus came out, and when he found Yeshua he fell down at his¦25895 feet¦25894
\v 23 and pleaded, “My¦25907 young daughter¦25906 is critical and just hanging on for you¦25914 to come¦25911 and touch her¦25924 so that she¦25927 can be healed¦25927 and live¦25929.”
\p
\v 24 So Yeshua went¦25933 off with Jairus. The large crowd¦25940 followed¦25937 also and¦25942 many were getting pressed¦25943 against Yeshua.
\p
\v 25 Then a woman¦25946 came who had been losing blood¦25951 for twelve¦25953 years¦25954
\v 26 and who had endured much under¦25959 various doctors¦25961 despite spending everything she had. After all that, she'd ended up even worse¦25977,
\v 27 but when she heard¦25980 about what Yeshua had been doing, she worked her way through the crowd¦25988 to the back of Yeshua and touched¦25992 his¦25995 clothes,
\v 28 because she¦25999 had told herself, “If I could even just touch¦26006 his¦26014 clothes, I would be healed¦26016.”
\p
\v 29 And immediately¦26018 the bleeding stopped and she knew¦26027 that she had been healed¦26031.
\v 30 Immediately also, Yeshua¦26042 knew that power¦26049 had gone out of him, and he turned¦26054 back towards the crowd¦26057 and said, “Who touched¦26062 my¦26061 clothes¦26064?”
\p
\v 31 But his¦26072 followers¦26071 said, “You can see all the people that were pressing¦26078 on you so why would you ask who touched¦26085 you?”
\p
\v 32 But Yeshua was still looking¦26087 around¦26087 to see¦26088 who had done it.
\v 33 And the woman¦26096, scared and shaking because of what was happening, came¦26109 and fell down in front of Yeshua and told him the whole story.
\v 34 Yeshua said¦26128, “Daughter¦26131, your¦26135 faith¦26134 has healed¦26136 you. Go¦26131 in peace¦26140 and full health¦26143.”
\p
\v 35 While he was still¦26163 speaking¦26150, messengers came from Jairus' house to tell him, “Your¦26160 daughter¦26159 has died¦26161. Why bother the teacher¦26166 any more?”
\p
\v 36 But Yeshua overheard¦26171 them telling this to the leader¦26180 and told him, “Don't be afraid—keep believing¦26184.”
\v 37 And Yeshua didn't allow¦26187 anyone to accompany¦26198 him¦26193 other than Peter, and Jacob and his brother¦26209, John.
\v 38 As they¦26213 approached Jairus' house¦26218, Yeshua saw a big commotion¦26225 with lots of crying and yelling going on.
\v 39 As he entered, he said, “Why are you all crying in distress¦26239? The child¦26244 hasn't died¦26246—she's just sleeping¦26248!”
\p
\v 40 But they just ridiculed¦26252 Yeshua. So he sent them all outside, just taking¦26266 the father¦26268 and mother¦26276 of the child, along with three with him. He went in where¦26287 the girl was
\v 41 and taking her¦26299 hand¦26297, he said, “Young woman, I tell you: get up!”
\v 42 Immediately she got up and walked around. And everyone marvelled¦26333 at the amazing thing that had happened. (She was twelve¦26331 years¦26330 old.)
\v 43 Yeshua repeatedly told them to keep this to themselves, and¦26347 added that they should give her¦26351 something¦26351 to eat¦26352.
\c 6
\s1 Yeshua's community can't believe he's from God
\r (Mat. 13:53-58; Luk. 4:16-30)
\p
\v 1 So Yeshua left there¦26355 and went back with his followers¦26367 to his hometown¦26361.
\v 2 It was now the Rest Day and when he started teaching¦26376 in the meeting hall, many who heard him were astonished¦26386, saying¦26391, “Where did he learn all this? How could he have such wisdom¦26400 and be able to do these¦26394 miracles¦26409?
\v 3 Isn't this the carpenter¦26423, the son of Mary, and the brother¦26431 of Jacob and Joseph and Judas and Simon? Don't his sisters¦26448 live around here?” And they¦26455 were offended¦26455 by his teaching.
\p
\v 4 \x + \xo 6:4: \xt Jn 4:44.\x*Yeshua told them, “A prophet¦26467 is only dishonouring¦26468 in his own home town¦26474, and among¦26478 his own relatives¦26481, and in his own home.”
\p
\v 5 And he wasn't able to do even one miracle¦26497 there¦26492, except¦26499 for placing his hands¦26505 on a few sick¦26502 people and healing them.
\v 6 He was amazed at how they wouldn't believe him as he went around the villages¦26520 teaching¦26523.
\s1 Yeshua sends his apprentices out in pairs
\r (Mat. 10:5-15; Luk. 9:1-6)
\p
\v 7 Then he called his twelve¦26528 apprentices and started sending¦26533 them out in pairs and giving¦26540 them authority¦26544 over demons.
\v 8 He insisted that they¦26555 can carry a walking stick but not to take food, a backpack, or money¦26577.
\v 9 They could wear one pair of sandals¦26580, but¦26578 not take changes of clothes.
\v 10 And he¦26589 told them, “Whenever you are invited into a home, stay at that one place until¦26602 you leave that town.
\v 11 \x + \xo 6:11: \xt Acts 13:51.\x*But if any places¦26611 don't want you or don't want to hear¦26617 what you have to say, just leave that place¦26611. As you go, shake¦26622 the dust off your¦26629 sandals so they can see \add that you pass the responsibility of what happened to them\add*.
\p
\v 12 So the apprentices went off and started telling people to repent¦26655.
\v 13 \x + \xo 6:13: \xt Jam 5:14.\x*And they drove out many demons¦26658, and anointed¦26664 many sick¦26669 people with olive¦26666 oil and healed them.
\s1 The execution of John-the-Immerser
\r (Mat. 14:1-12; Luk. 9:7-9)
\p
\v 14 \x + \xo 6:14-15: \xt Mat 16:14; Mrk 8:28; Luk 9:19.\x*Yeshua was now becoming well known and King Herod \add Antipas\add* heard¦26674 about him. He thought that maybe John-the-Immerser had come back to life and that's why he was able to do miracles¦26705.
\p
\v 15 But others thought it was \add the promised return of\add* Elijah, and¦26716 yet others thought he¦26724 must be another prophet¦26719 like the ones \add in the Scriptures\add*.
\p
\v 16 But hearing about Yeshua, Herod was telling people, “That John who I had beheaded¦26736, he must have come back to life!”
\v 17 \x + \xo 6:17-18: \xt Luk 3:19-20.\x*Because Herod himself¦26749 had had John arrested and put in prison¦26768 because he had married¦26781 Herodias, his¦26774 brother¦26776 Philip's wife¦26773.
\v 18 John had been telling him that it was wrong for him to marry his¦26801 brother's¦26800 wife¦26797,
\v 19 and so Herodias resented¦26806 him enough to want to kill¦26813 him, but Herod hadn't be able to
\v 20 because he respected John as a righteous¦26828 and holy teacher and so he kept him alive. He often enjoyed hearing¦26845 from John and thought a lot about what he said.
\p
\v 21 However, an opportunity¦26850 came at Herod's birthday¦26855 celebration¦26855, when he threw a feast for his¦26856 top officials and generals and for the leaders¦26868 in Galilee¦26870.
\v 22 The daughter¦26876 of Herodias came in and danced¦26882 for them, and the king and his party guests all enjoyed it. So the king said to the young woman, “Just ask me for anything and I'll give it to you.”
\v 23 And he made an oath, “Even if you asked for half of my¦26934 kingdom¦26933, I'd give it to you!”
\p
\v 24 So she went out and asked her mother what she should ask for. Her¦26942 mother told her that she should ask for John's head.
\p
\v 25 So going back into the party, she¦26967 said seriously to the king¦26966, “I would like the head of John-the-Immerser on a plate!”
\p
\v 26 The king¦26991 was really upset with that, but because¦26994 he had made loud oaths¦26996 in front of all his guests, he couldn't say no.
\v 27 So he ordered an executioner¦27014 to go out and return with John's head. He went off and beheaded¦27028 him in the prison¦27032
\v 28 and brought¦27034 the head into the party on a plate and gave it to the girl, and she gave it to her¦27053 mother¦27052.
\v 29 When John's followers¦27058 heard¦27055 about this, they came¦27060 and fetched his¦27059 body and put it into a tomb¦27074.
\s1 Yeshua feeds 5,000 people
\r (Mat. 14:13-21; Luk. 9:10-17; Jn 6:1-14)
\p
\v 30 Now the apprentices who had been sent out returned back to Yeshua¦27081 and they reported¦27083 back everything they had done and what they had been teaching \add people\add*.
\v 31 Then he told them, “Let's just all of us head for a quiet place¦27109 and take a break.” This was because there were so many people always coming¦27119 and going¦27122, and sometimes they didn't even have a chance to eat¦27126.
\v 32 So they¦27133 went¦27133 by boat¦27138 away to a quiet place¦27143 by themselves¦27147.
\p
\v 33 But people from towns all around had seen them going¦27153 and recognised¦27159 who they were, so they ran¦27172 around the lake on foot¦27164 and got there¦27173 ahead¦27175 of them.
\v 34 \x + \xo 6:34: \xt Num 27:17; 1Ki 22:17; 2Ch 18:16; Eze 34:5; Mat 9:36.\x*So when Yeshua got out of the boat, he saw¦27188 a big crowd¦27193 and felt sorry for them because¦27202 they seemed like sheep¦27205 without a shepherd¦27208, so he started teaching¦27212 them many things¦27215.
\v 35 Then, when it was already getting late, his¦27227 apprentices¦27226 came up and said, “This place¦27236 is pretty isolated and it's already late.
\v 36 Send these people off now so they can go to the nearby settlements and villages¦27254 and buy themselves¦27257 something¦27260 to eat¦27262.”
\p
\v 37 But Yeshua answered¦27269 them, “You give them something to eat.”
\p They complained, “If we go, should we buy several months wages worth of bread so we can give all of them something to eat?”
\p
\v 38 But he¦27301 asked, “Go and find out how much bread you¦27310 have.”
\p When they'd found out they said, “Five buns and two¦27323 fish.”
\p
\v 39 Yeshua told all the people to line up in rows and sit¦27330 down on the green¦27341 grass¦27342.
\v 40 So they sat¦27345 down in rows of fifty¦27355 to a hundred¦27351.
\v 41 Then holding the five buns and two fish, he looking up to the sky¦27368 and blessed¦27369 \add God\add*, and then broke¦27373 up the buns and gave pieces to his¦27381 apprentices¦27380 so they could do likewise to the people, and he also divided¦27392 up the two fish,
\v 42 and all the people ate¦27395 and were satisfied¦27398.
\v 43 Then they¦27400 collected the left-over pieces of bread, filling¦27406 twelve¦27403 baskets¦27405, as well as the left-over pieces of fish.
\v 44 And the headcount of men¦27423 who ate that evening was five¦27421 thousand¦27421.
\s1 Yeshua walks on the lake surface
\r (Mat. 14:22-33; Jn 6:15-21)
\p
\v 45 Straight after that, Yeshua sent his¦27431 apprentices¦27430 off in the boat¦27435 to go across¦27442 to Bethsaida while he sent the crowd¦27452 home.
\v 46 Then he said goodbye¦27454 to everyone, and climbed the hill to pray.
\v 47 Later in the night, the boat¦27467 was out in the middle of the lake, and only Yeshua remained back there on the land.
\v 48 He saw them struggling to row against the wind, and sometime after 3am he came out to them, walking¦27511 on the lake surface as if to walk past them.
\v 49 But they had seen¦27525 someone walking¦27531 on the lake and thought it was a ghost¦27534, and they yelled out
\v 50 because they had all seen it and were terrified.
\p But Yeshua immediately¦27550 spoke¦27552 to them and said, “Hey, take heart, it's me, don't be afraid!”
\v 51 Then he climbed up into the boat¦27574 and the wind died¦27578 down. And they were all totally astounded
\v 52 because they¦27593 hadn't understood¦27593 the implications of him feeding all the people because their¦27600 minds were closed.
\s1 Yeshua heals many people around Gennesaret
\r (Mat. 14:34-36)
\p
\v 53 After completing their crossing¦27606, they¦27613 anchored¦27618 at Gennesaret¦27615.
\v 54 And when they got out of the boat¦27624, again people recognised¦27627 Yeshua
\v 55 and ran¦27636 around¦27636 that region, so next minute people began¦27645 bringing all of those who were sick, carrying¦27656 them on pallets¦27649 to wherever¦27660 they heard that Yeshua was.
\v 56 And whenever Yeshua entered¦27679 villages¦27682 or cities¦27685 or fields¦27688 or marketplaces¦27696, they laid the sick down there and were imploring¦27702 him that they might even just touch¦27711 the edge of his¦27710 robe, and anyone who did so was healed¦27719.
\c 7
\s1 Yeshua suggests obeying God, not tradition
\r (Mat. 15:1-9)
\p
\v 1 Some from the Pharisee party¦27725 and¦27726 some of the law teachers had come¦27730 from Jerusalem to observe Yeshua
\v 2 and¦27733 noticed that some of his¦27740 followers¦27739 were eating¦27749 their food without following their religious customs, i.e., without washing their hands¦27744.
\v 3 (The Pharisees and¦27758, in fact, all the Jewish religious leaders do not eat without first ceremonially washing their hands¦27768 as taught by their elders¦27778 over the generations.
\v 4 They won't eat at the market¦27781 if they can't do this first, and have many other¦27792 regulations about ceremonial washing¦27802 of cups and jugs and copper¦27807 kettles¦27807.)
\p
\v 5 And the Pharisees and¦27817 religious teachers asked Yeshua, “How come your¦27827 followers¦27826 don't follow our¦27833 Jewish traditions¦27832, but¦27835 eat without the ceremonial washing of hands¦27841?”
\p
\v 6 \x + \xo 7:6-7: \xt Isa 29:13 (LXX).\x*And he answered¦27847, “Isaiah got it exactly right¦27851 when he expressed God's thoughts about you hypocrites¦27859 and wrote:
\q1 ‘These people¦27867 honour¦27873 me with their lips¦27870,
\q2 but their real desires are far away from mine.
\q1
\v 7 Their worship¦27886 of me is worthless,
\q2 teaching¦27888 man-made rules as if they¦27886 are from God.’
\p
\v 8 You've ignored God's commands¦27907 instead accepting human¦27915 traditions¦27913.
\p
\v 9 And Yeshua continued, “You all simply dismiss God's commands¦27933 in favour of your¦27939 own customs.
\v 10 \x + \xo 7:10: a \xt Exo 20:12; Deu 5:16; \xo b \xt Exo 21:17; Lev 20:9.\x*Moses teaches us,
\q1 ‘Honour your¦27949 parents,’
\p and
\q1 ‘Anyone dishonestly slandering their¦27953 parents deserves the death¦27961 penalty.’
\m
\v 11 But when you all encourage people to say¦27970, ‘Whatever I had that may have helped you guys has been given to God’,
\v 12 you¦27992 are actively discouraging them from helping their parents—
\v 13 overriding God's voice for your¦28013 very convenient teaching that you disseminate instead. And that's not the only example!”
\s1 Evil comes from inside a person
\r (Mat. 15:10-20)
\p
\v 14 Yeshua called¦28028 out to the crowd¦28032, “Everyone listen to me carefully:
\v 15 Nothing that enters¦28050 your mouth makes you guilty in God's eyes. It's what comes \em out\em* of you that demonstrates your culpability.”
\p
\v 16 ≈
\v 17 When Yeshua came¦28084 back inside, his¦28098 apprentices¦28097 asked him what he meant.
\v 18 But he scolded them, “Can't you understand¦28114 something so simple! Can't you see that anything from the outside¦28119 that enters¦28120 your body doesn't make you guilty in God's sight,
\v 19 because¦28130 it doesn't enter¦28134 your mind but merely goes into your stomach and ends up in the toilet.” (By saying this he clearly showed that is was ok for Jews to eat any food.)
\p
\v 20 He continued, “It's what comes out of you that makes you guilty in God's eyes.
\v 21-22 That's because evil¦28184 thoughts, sexual¦28187 immorality¦28187, theft¦28189, murder¦28192, adultery¦28194, greed, wickedness, deceit, arrogance, lust, slander, pride, and foolishness all come from \em inside¦28174\em* people's¦28180 hearts¦28178 \add and minds\add*.
\v 23 So it's the evil¦28213 that's inside¦28214 a person¦28221 and¦28217 comes out that makes them guilty in God's eyes.”
\s1 The bold faith of a non-Jewish woman
\r (Mat. 15:21-28)
\p
\v 24 Yeshua left that place and went¦28227 \add up north\add* into the regions¦28230 of Tyre and Sidon. He tried to enter a house¦28239 without being noticed¦28249 but didn't succeed,
\v 25 and straight away a woman¦28258 who had heard¦28256 about¦28259 him turned up. She knelt in front of him because she had a little¦28264 daughter¦28264 who was demon-possessed.
\v 26 The woman¦28284 was Greek from Phoenicia in Syria and¦28294 she¦28295 begged Yeshua to command the demon¦28299 to leave her¦28306 daughter¦28305.
\v 27 But he replied, “Let the \add Jewish\add* children be treated first¦28316, because it's not good to take the children's food and throw¦28334 it to the dogs.”
\p
\v 28 And she¦28335 responded, “Yes, master¦28343, but the puppies under the table¦28354 \em do\em* get to eat the little crumbs¦28360 that the children¦28363 drop.”
\p
\v 29 And he answered, “Go home now. As a result of how you just spoke, the demon¦28375 has already left your¦28376 daughter¦28378.”
\p
\v 30 And when she¦28389 got home¦28386, the demon¦28408 had indeed gone and her little¦28396 girl was lying quietly on her bed.
\s1 Yeshua heals a deaf man who couldn't speak
\p
\v 31 Yeshua left the Tyre region, passed through¦28418 Sidon, and came¦28417 down the \add eastern\add* side of the Lake of Galilee¦28427 to the Decapolis region.
\v 32 The people there brought a man¦28442 to him who couldn't hear or speak, and asked Yeshua to heal him.
\v 33 So Yeshua took the man back away from the crowd¦28462, put his¦28471 fingers¦28470 in the man's ears¦28475, then he spat and touched¦28480 the man's mouth.
\v 34 Looking up to the sky¦28489, he sighed and said, “Open up!”
\p
\v 35 Then the man could hear, and his¦28504 tongue¦28516 was released¦28512 and he began to speak¦28519 properly.
\v 36 The Yeshua advised that they shouldn't tell anyone, but the more he¦28522 said that, the more they seemed to spread it¦28540 around.
\v 37 The crowds were totally amazed, saying¦28545, “He can do anything—he makes the deaf able to hear, and enables the ones who couldn't speak¦28559.”
\c 8
\s1 Yeshua feeds 4,000 people
\r (Mat. 15:32-39)
\p
\v 1 Another time there was a large crowd¦28568 again¦28566 with nothing to eat. Yeshua called¦28576 his¦28581 apprentices¦28580 and told¦28582 them¦28583,
\v 2 “I feel sorry for all these people because¦28593 they've already¦28594 been with us for three¦28598 days¦28595 and¦28607 don't have anything¦28610 to eat¦28611.
\v 3 I can't send¦28614 them home¦28620 because they're too weak to walk, and some have a long way to go.”
\p
\v 4 His¦28646 apprentices¦28645 queried, “Where could anyone¦28657 find enough food out here in the wilderness¦28663?”
\p
\v 5 He asked, “How much bread have you¦28675 all got?”
\p “Seven¦28682 buns,” they¦28678 answered.
\p
\v 6 So Yeshua instructed the crowd to sit down on the ground¦28691. Then he took the seven¦28695 buns, gave thanks¦28698 and broke¦28699 them and gave pieces to his¦28705 apprentices¦28704 to then distribute to the crowd.
\v 7 They also had a few small cooked fish, so he¦28724 blessed¦28721 them too and¦28718 got them to distribute them as well.
\v 8 After all the people had eaten and were full, they collected seven¦28751 basketfulls¦28752 of leftovers.
\v 9 There were some four¦28760 thousand¦28760 people there that day, and¦28760 Yeshua sent¦28762 them home after they'd eaten¦28758.
\v 10 And he and his¦28778 apprentices¦28777 climbed into the boat¦28774 and headed for the Dalmanutha¦28790 region.
\s1 The religious leaders want to see a miracle
\r (Mat. 16:1-4)
\p
\v 11 \x + \xo 8:11: \xt Mat 12:38; Luk 11:16.\x*Some men from the Pharisee party¦28798 came¦28795 out to Yeshua amd started arguing with him. They were checking him out and wanted to see a miracle.
\v 12 \x + \xo 8:12: \xt Mat 12:39; Luk 11:29.\x*Yeshua grieved inside and asked, “Why do you people need to see a miracle before you'll believe me? Actually, no miracle will be done for this generation.”
\p
\v 13 So Yeshua left in the boat again¦28852 and crossed to the other side of the lake.
\s1 The apprentices miss the significance of what's happening
\r (Mat. 16:5-12)
\p
\v 14 But Yeshua's apprentices forgot¦28863 to take¦28867 any food other than one bun that someone in the boat¦28883 had.
\v 15 \x + \xo 8:15: \xt Luk 12:1.\x*He told them, “Watch out for the yeast of the Pharisees and¦28897 of King Herod.”
\p
\v 16 They asked each other what it meant—was it because¦28911 they forgot food?
\p
\v 17 But Yeshua knew what they were saying¦28921 and asked, “Why are you all discussing about not having food? Can't you figure it¦28918 out? Or are your¦28950 minds completely closed?
\v 18 \x + \xo 8:18: \xt Jer 5:21; Eze 12:2; Mrk 4:12.\x*You all have eyes¦28951 but can't seem to see and have ears¦28960 but can't seem to listen. Have you already forgotten what just happened?
\v 19 When I broke¦28980 up the five buns to feed five thousand¦28983 people, how many basketfulls¦28986 of leftovers did you collect?”
\p “Twelve¦28994,” they answered.
\p
\v 20 “And when we fed four¦29003 thousand¦29003 with seven¦28999 buns, how many full baskets¦29006 of leftovers then?”
\p “Seven¦29020,” they¦29018 answered.
\p
\v 21 Yeshua asked, “How can you all not understand¦29030 what's going on right in front of you!”
\s1 Yeshua heals a blind man near Bethsaida
\p
\v 22 As they entered Bethsaida, the people brought a blind¦29041 man¦29041 to Yeshua and asked him to touch¦29047 him.
\v 23 So Yeshua took the man's hand¦29053 and led him out of the village¦29063. Then he spat in his eyes¦29069, placed his hands¦29074 on him, and asked him, “What can you see?”
\p
\v 24 The man looked¦29089 around and answered, “I can see the people¦29096, but they just look like trees¦29100.”
\v 25 Yeshua touched the man's eyes¦29114 again¦29105 and then he could see clearly—he was now completely better.
\v 26 Then Yeshua told him not to go back into the village¦29164 but to go straight home¦29145.
\s1 Yeshua asks who they think he is
\r (Mat. 16:13-20; Luk. 9:18-21)
\p
\v 27 Then Yeshua and his¦29180 followers moved around the various villages¦29183 of Caesaria Philippi. On the way, he asked them, “Who does everyone think I am?”
\p
\v 28 \x + \xo 8:28: \xt Mrk 6:14-15; Luk 9:7-8.\x*They said, “Some say John-the-Immerser, some say Elijah, and¦29219 some say one of the prophets¦29230.”
\p
\v 29 \x + \xo 8:29: \xt Jn 6:68-69.\x*Then he asked, “And what do you all think?”
\p Peter said, “You are the promised one sent by God.”
\p
\v 30 Then Yeshua warned¦29262 them not to tell others about him¦29271.
\s1 Yeshua's radical challenge to his would-be followers
\r (Mat. 16:21-28; Luk. 9:22-27)
\p
\v 31 Then Yeshua¦29283 began¦29275 teaching¦29276 his followers that mankind's child would need to suffer¦29285 a lot, to be rejected¦29287 by the religious leaders, and so to be put to death but to come back to life after¦29302 three¦29304 days¦29306.
\v 32 He taught this very clearly, but Peter took him aside¦29315 and told him off.
\v 33 Yeshua turned¦29326 back and looked at the others, then reprimanded Peter, “Stand back, Satan¦29342! you're applying human¦29352 values instead of considering God's plan.”
\p
\v 34 \x + \xo 8:34: \xt Mat 10:38; Luk 14:27.\x*Calling out to them and to the crowd¦29356, he said¦29361, “Anyone who wants to follow me must first put aside their¦29380 own desires and then follow me—even through very difficult times.
\v 35 \x + \xo 8:35: \xt Mat 10:39; Luk 17:33; Jn 12:25.\x*Anyone who worries about saving¦29412 their own life will lose it, but whoever gives their life due to following me and my¦29404 teaching will save their life.
\v 36 Because it¦29417 doesn't benefit¦29417 a person¦29419 if they gain everything in the world¦29425 but lose their soul¦29433.
\v 37 What can someone offer in order to buy a home for their soul¦29444?
\v 38 Yes, whoever¦29448 is ashamed of me and my¦29453 message¦29461 in front of this adulterous¦29467 and sinful¦29469 generation¦29464, mankind's child will likewise be ashamed of them when he comes clearly displaying God's¦29474 greatness and bringing the holy angels¦29488.”
\c 9
\p
\v 1 And he continued, “I can assure you that some of the ones standing here won't die until¦29514 they have seen God's powerful¦29523 kingdom¦29518 arrive.”
\s1 Moses and Elijah speak with Yeshua
\r (Mat. 17:1-13; Luk. 9:28-36)
\p
\v 2 \x + \xo 9:2-7: \xt 2Pe 1:17-18.\x*Six days¦29526 later Yeshua took Peter and Jacob and John, and just the four of them went up onto a high hill. Then he¦29557 was changed right in front of their eyes
\v 3 and¦29565 his¦29568 clothes¦29567 turned incredibly shining¦29571 white—whiter than any bleach could make them.
\v 4 And Elijah and Moses appeared beside Yeshua¦29605 and started talking with him.
\v 5 Peter said to Yeshua¦29614, “Teacher, it's good¦29616 that we're here. Maybe we could make three¦29628 shelters up here: one for you¦29630 and one for Moses and one for Elijah?”
\v 6 He said that because they¦29650 were terrified¦29648 and didn't know what to say.
\p
\v 7 \x + \xo 9:7: \xt Mat 3:17; Mrk 1:11; Luk 3:22.\x*Then a cloud came over the sun and a voice¦29662 came out of the cloud saying, “This is my¦29673 dear son. Listen to him.”
\v 8 When they looked¦29685 around¦29685, they couldn't see anyone else there any more, except¦29692 for Yeshua¦29696 himself.
\p
\v 9 As they descended again, Yeshua¦29725 told them to tell no one what had happened up there until after mankind's child came back to life.
\p
\v 10 They remembered that, although between all three of them they¦29734 couldn't understand the bit about coming back to life.
\v 11 \x + \xo 9:11: \xt Mal 4:5; Mat 11:14.\x*They asked Yeshua, “Isn't it¦29763 written that Elijah will be the first¦29766 to return?”
\p
\v 12 He answered, “Yes, Elijah is indeed¦29776 the one to come¦29777 first¦29779 to start the restoration¦29780. But isn't it¦29788 also written¦29788 that mankind's child will suffer¦29796 a lot and¦29797 be scorned¦29798?
\v 13 You see, Elijah has come¦29808 already, and they treated him just however they liked, just like it was written¦29817 that it would happen.”
\s1 Yeshua drives out a stubborn demon
\r (Mat. 17:14-21; Luk. 9:37-43a)
\p
\v 14 When they got back to \add his other\add* followers¦29826, Yeshua saw¦29827 that they were surrounded by a large crowd¦29830 and¦29835 the religious teachers were debating¦29838 with them.
\v 15 The crowd¦29848 were very surprised when they noticed Yeshua and came running¦29860 to greet¦29861 him.
\v 16 He asked¦29864 them, “What were you¦29869 all talking about?”
\p
\v 17 One of the people answered¦29877, “Teacher¦29886, I brought¦29887 my¦29890 son here—he has a demon that prevents him from speaking.
\v 18 Whenever it takes hold of him, it attacks¦29903 him and he starts foaming¦29906 at the mouth and grating¦29908 his teeth¦29910 and his joints lock up. I tried to get your¦29919 followers¦29918 to command it to leave but they couldn't.”
\p
\v 19 Yeshua replied, “You are a faithless generation¦29940. How much longer will I have to be here? How much longer can I tolerate¦29952 you all? Bring him¦29956 here.”
\v 20 So they brought¦29961 the boy to him. When he saw Yeshua, the demon immediately¦29971 caused him to have convulsions¦29972 and fall on the ground¦29980—rolling¦29981 over and foaming¦29982 at the mouth.
\p
\v 21 Yeshua asked¦29984 his¦29988 father¦29987, “How long has this been happening?”
\p “Since he was small,” he replied,
\v 22 “and often¦30008 it throws¦30015 him into the fire¦30013 or into water¦30018 to try to destroy¦30021 him. But if you feel sorry for us and can do it, please help¦30030 us.”
\p
\v 23 Yeshua asked him¦30041, “If I can? A person who believes¦30051 can do anything.”
\p
\v 24 The boys father¦30058 cried¦30055 out, “I do believe¦30068—help¦30070 me to fight unbelief¦30074.”
\p
\v 25 Then Yeshua¦30082 noticing that a big crowd¦30087 was quickly forming, scolded the evil spirit, “You spirit who causes muteness and deafness. Leave this boy now and never return to him.”
\p
\v 26 There was yelling and strong convulsions¦30122, and then the demon left him and the boy lay still as if dead¦30131, and many people thought he was.
\v 27 But Yeshua¦30141 took his¦30146 hand¦30145 and lifted it, and the boy got up.
\p
\v 28 When Yeshua and his¦30165 apprentices¦30164 had gone into the house¦30159 by themselves¦30169, they asked him, “How come¦30154 we couldn't drive it¦30186 out?”
\p
\v 29 He replied, “This kind will only leave after prayer¦30202 and¦30203 fasting¦30204.”
\s1 Yeshua talks again about being executed
\r (Mat. 17:22-23; Luk. 9:43b-45)
\p
\v 30 Then they¦30210 left that place and¦30214 were moving around Galilee¦30213, because Yeshua didn't want people to know¦30219 where he¦30216 was
\v 31 while he was teaching¦30221 his¦30225 apprentices¦30224. He told them, “mankind's child will be arrested and executed, but after¦30246 three¦30248 days¦30250 he'll come back to life.”
\p
\v 32 But they didn't know what that meant, and they were too scared to ask¦30263 him¦30261.
\s1 How to be the best
\r (Mat. 18:1-5; Luk. 9:46-48)
\p
\v 33 Then they went Capernaum and when they arrived at the house¦30273, Yeshua asked them what they were discussing on the way¦30280.
\p
\v 34 \x + \xo 9:34: \xt Luk 22:24.\x*But they didn't reply because while they were walking, they had been talking about which of them is the best.
\v 35 \x + \xo 9:35: \xt Mat 20:26-27; 23:11; Mrk 10:43-44; Luk 22:26.\x*So Yeshua sat¦30308 down and called¦30309 the twelve¦30311 of them and explained, “Whoever wants to be at the top, has to be at the bottom and help all the others.”
\v 36 Then Yeshua called a young boy and stood¦30330 him in the middle of them, and giving him a hug said¦30342,
\v 37 \x + \xo 9:37: \xt Mat 10:40; Luk 10:16; Jn 13:20.\x*“Whoever¦30344 welcomes young children¦30351 on my¦30359 behalf, welcomes me, and¦30362 whoever¦30363 welcomes me is not actually welcoming me, but¦30373 welcoming the one who sent¦30375 me here.”
\s1 Others are also serving Yeshua
\r (Luk. 9:49-50)
\p
\v 38 John checked with Yeshua¦30388, “Teacher¦30384, we saw¦30389 someone¦30391 using your¦30395 authority to command demons¦30397 to leave, but we told him off because¦30409 he wasn't one of us.”
\p
\v 39 Yeshua responded, “No, don't stop him¦30421 because anyone who does a miracle¦30427 using my¦30432 name¦30431 won't just quickly¦30436 turn around and slander me.
\v 40 \x + \xo 9:40: \xt Mat 12:30; Luk 11:23.\x*Anyone who's not against¦30444 us is for us.
\v 41 \x + \xo 9:41: \xt Mat 10:42.\x* Anyone who gives you water¦30459 to drink¦30456 because you are followers of God's chosen¦30466 one and who does it because they are working for me, I can assure you that they'll receive their¦30466 reward¦30478.
\s1 Difficult teachings about disobedience
\r (Mat. 18:6-9; Luk. 17:1-2)
\p
\v 42 But anyone who causes a young person to falter from their trust in me, it¦30497 would be better¦30496 if they were thrown¦30516 into the sea¦30520 with a heavy¦30508 weight tied around their neck.
\v 43 \x + \xo 9:43: \xt Mat 5:30.\x*If your¦30528 hand¦30527 causes you to disobey God, cut it off—it's better¦30531 to enter \add eternal\add* life¦30540 being maimed¦30536, than to have two¦30545 hands¦30546 but to be thrown into the fire¦30558 that never goes out.
\v 44 ≈
\v 45 And if your¦30577 foot¦30576 causes you to disobey God, cut it off—it's better¦30585 to enter \add eternal\add* life¦30595 being maimed, than to have two¦30603 feet¦30604 but to be thrown¦30607 into hell.
\v 46 ≈
\v 47 \x + \xo 9:47: \xt Mat 5:29.\x*And if your¦30633 eye¦30632 causes you to disobey God, gouge it out—it's better¦30640 to enter God's kingdom¦30648 one-eyed¦30644, than to have two¦30653 eyes¦30654 and be thrown into hell
\v 48 where¦30663 the worms never die and¦30669 the fire¦30671 never goes out.
\p
\v 49 Everyone will be salted¦30678 with fire¦30677.
\p
\v 50 \x + \xo 9:50: \xt Mat 5:13; Luk 14:34-35.\x*Now salt is good¦30686, but¦30691 if it¦30701 were to go bad, what would you¦30702 season¦30702 \add your food\add* with then? So keep yourselves¦30707 like salt, and¦30711 strive to get on well with each other.
\c 10
\s1 It's God that joins husband and wife
\r (Mat. 19:1-12; Luk. 16:18)
\p
\v 1 Then Yeshua left there¦30717 and went down to the Judean area and across the Jordan river. Again the crowds¦30738 followed him, and he taught them just like he usually did.
\p
\v 2 Some from the Pharisee party¦30752 approached¦30749 Yeshua to check him out and asked, “Does the law allow a husband¦30761 to dismiss his wife¦30762?”
\p
\v 3 “Well, what law did Moses give to you¦30772 all?” he¦30766 asked.
\p
\v 4 \x + \xo 10:4: \xt Deu 24:1-4; Mat 5:31.\x*They answered, “Moses¦30782 said¦30778 that a husband is allowed to write¦30786 a statement of divorce¦30784 and¦30787 dismiss his wife with it.”
\p
\v 5 Yeshua responded, “Yes, he wrote¦30800 that law because he saw your¦30799 stubborn desires,
\v 6 \x + \xo 10:6: \xt Gen 1:27; 5:2.\x*but¦30807 God made both men and¦30811 women right at the beginning¦30808.
\v 7 \x + \xo 10:7-8: \xt Gen 2:24.\x*As a result, a man¦30824 leaves his parents and joins together with his wife¦30838
\v 8 and the couple become a single unit. So there's no longer¦30850 two of them, but only one.
\v 9 So if it's God who joins them together¦30862 like that, no person¦30863 \add has the authority\add* to separate¦30865 them.”
\p
\v 10 Back in the house¦30873 again¦30875, his apprentices¦30878 asked about this.
\v 11 \x + \xo 10:11-12: \xt Mat 5:32; 1Cor 7:10-11.\x*And Yeshua told them, “Whoever¦30896 divorces his wife and marries another¦30910 person, commits adultery¦30912 towards his wife.”
\v 12 And likewise if the wife divorces her husband and marries another¦30934 person, she is committing adultery¦30937 towards her husband.”
\s1 Yeshua encourages childlike faith
\r (Mat. 19:13-15; Luk. 18:15-17)
\p
\v 13 The people were bringing¦30939 small children¦30941 for Yeshua to touch¦30945, but¦30947 his apprentices¦30948 scolded them.
\v 14 However, Yeshua¦30958 noticed it and was upset, “Just let those kids come. Don't prevent them because God's kingdom¦30982 consists of people like them.
\v 15 \x + \xo 10:15: \xt Mat 18:3.\x*Actually, you can't even enter God's kingdom¦30996 unless you accept it¦31005 just like a small child¦31000 does.”
\v 16 So he continued hugging the children and \add commanding\add* a good life for them as he placed his hands¦31016 on each one.
\s1 Leaving behind everything to be saved
\r (Mat. 19:16-30; Luk. 18:18-30)
\p
\v 17 One time when Yeshua was starting out on a trip, a man caught up to him and kneeling down in front of him asked, “Good teacher, what do I have to do to inherit¦31048 eternal¦31047 life¦31046?”
\p
\v 18 He answered, “Why do you call me \em good\em*? No person is good—only God is.
\v 19 \x + \xo 10:19: a \xt Exo 20:13; Deu 5:17; \xo b \xt Exo 20:14; Deu 5:18; \xo c \xt Exo 20:15; Deu 5:19; \xo d \xt Exo 20:16; Deu 5:20; \xo e \xt Exo 20:12; Deu 5:16.\x*You know the commandments¦31067: don't murder¦31073, don't commit¦31075 adultery¦31075, don't steal¦31077, don't lie about others, don't defraud¦31082 others, and¦31088 honour¦31084 your¦31087 parents.”
\p
\v 20 The man responded, “I've kept¦31103 all of those since I was young.”
\p
\v 21 Yeshua¦31114 looked up at him with genuine love and said¦31121, “There's one thing¦31128 still to be done: sell everything you have and give¦31137 the money to the poor—then you'll have wealth in heaven¦31144. After¦31114 that, come¦31147 and follow¦31148 me.”
\v 22 But the man grew very sad when he heard this, because he owned many properties¦31178.
\p
\v 23 Yeshua¦31184 looked¦31182 around¦31182 at his¦31189 followers¦31188, “It's so difficult¦31191 for wealthy¦31194 people to enter God's kingdom¦31198.”
\p
\v 24 His¦31210 followers¦31204 were a bit stunned at his¦31210 teaching.) Yeshua¦31213 continued, “Yes, it's certainly difficult¦31221 to enter into God's kingdom¦31230.
\v 25 It's easier¦31235 for a camel¦31239 to go through the eye¦31243 of a needle¦31247 than for a rich person to enter God's kingdom¦31256.”
\p
\v 26 Now they¦31261 were totally stunned, asking, “How can anyone possibly be saved¦31273 then?”
\p
\v 27 Yeshua looked intently at them, “Yes, humanly¦31283 it's quite impossible¦31285. But with God it's different—God can do anything!”
\p
\v 28 Peter said, “We left everything and came and followed¦31314 you¦31316.”
\p
\v 29 He answered, “Yes I can assure you¦31331 all that whoever left their home or farm, and left their siblings or parents or children¦31351 because of me and my¦31355 teaching,
\v 30 they'll be rewarded one hundred¦31368 times over with homes and farms¦31391 and siblings and parents and children¦31389 along with persecution¦31393, but gaining eternal¦31402 life¦31401 in the next era.
\v 31 \x + \xo 10:31: \xt Mat 20:16; Luk 13:30.\x*But many at the top now will be at the bottom then, and¦31410 many at the bottom now will be blessed then.”
\s1 Yeshua predicts his execution a third time
\r (Mat. 20:17-19; Luk. 18:31-34)
\p
\v 32 They were heading south to Jerusalem with Yeshua in front, and his followers¦31434 were a bit surprised and a bit scared. Yeshua took the twelve¦31441 aside and started telling¦31444 them what was going to happen¦31448 to him,
\v 33 “We're on our way down to Jerusalem and mankind's child will be turned over to the chief¦31461 priests¦31461 and the religious teachers, and they'll sentence him to die and pass him over to the non-Jews.
\v 34 Then they'll ridicule him and spit on him before they beat him and execute him, but he'll come back to life again in three¦31495 days¦31497 time.”
\s1 How to become respected in God's kingdom
\r (Mat. 20:20-28)
\p
\v 35 Then Jacob and John, the two¦31510 sons¦31511 of Zebedee¦31512 approached¦31504 Yeshua and asked, “Teacher¦31517, we'd like to ask a favour from you—please don't disappoint us.”
\p
\v 36 “What do you want from me?” Yeshua asked.
\p
\v 37 They answered, “Allow us two to sit¦31565 beside you in heaven—one of us on each side of you.”
\p
\v 38 \x + \xo 10:38: \xt Luk 12:50.\x*But Yeshua replied, “You don't even understand what you're asking for. Do you think you could endure the suffering that I have to go through? Or to be enveloped in the darkness that I have to go down into?”
\p
\v 39 And they replied, “Sure we can.”
\p “And indeed you all will suffer like me and be enveloped in darkness like I will be,” responded Yeshua¦31611,
\v 40 but as for deciding who will sit¦31631 next to me, that's not my¦31634 decision to make because it's already been decided.”
\p
\v 41 When the ten¦31658 other apprentices heard¦31655 what these two had asked for, they were upset at Jacob and¦31669 John.
\v 42 \x + \xo 10:42-43: \xt Luk 22:25-26.\x*But Yeshua¦31678 called¦31675 them over, “Listen, in most countries their rulers boss the people around and¦31692 their leaders exert their authority¦31698 over them.
\v 43 \x + \xo 10:43-44: \xt Mat 23:11; Mrk 9:35; Luk 22:26.\x*But it¦31704 doesn't work like that with you—anyone of you who wanted to be honoured must serve the others,
\v 44 and¦31726 whoever¦31727 wants to become the most respected has to \add work\add* like a slave¦31740 does.
\v 45 Even¦31746 mankind's child didn't come to be served¦31749, but¦31750 to serve¦31751 others and¦31752 to give¦31753 his¦31756 life¦31755 as a ransom¦31758 to set many people free.
\s1 Blind Bartimeus gets his miracle
\r (Mat. 20:29-34; Luk. 18:35-43)
\p
\v 46 They arrived at Jericho, and then when Yeshua and his¦31776 followers¦31775 were leaving again with a large¦31779 crowd¦31778 following, they¦31762 came across blind¦31785 Bartimeus¦31783 sitting¦31788 beside¦31789 the path begging.
\v 47 When he heard¦31795 that it was Yeshua from Nazareth¦31802 going past, he yelled out, “Yeshua, \add promised\add* descendant of David, help me please.”
\p
\v 48 When several people told him to stop, he just yelled out even louder, “Yeshua, \add promised\add* descendant of David¦31829, help me please.”
\p
\v 49 Then Yeshua¦31835 stopped¦31833 and got the people to call the blind¦31847 man¦31847. So they called him, “Hey, be confident! Get up and come because he's called for you.”
\p
\v 50 So Bartimeus threw off his¦31862 jacket, jumped¦31863 up, and was led to Yeshua¦31869.
\p
\v 51 “Now, what can I do for you?” Yeshua¦31875 asked.
\p “My teacher¦31889, I'd like to be able to see,” Bartimeus replied.
\p
\v 52 Then Yeshua responded, “Ok, off you go then—your¦31902 faith¦31901 has saved¦31903 you.”
\p And immediately¦31907 Bartimeus was able to see, and followed¦31910 along the path after¦31911 Yeshua.
\c 11
\s1 Yeshua is treated like a king as he enters Jerusalem
\r (Mat. 21:1-11; Luk. 19:28-40; Jn 12:12-19)
\p
\v 1 As they¦31919 got close to Jerusalem and were passing Bethphage and Bethany on the Mount¦31933 of Olives¦31936, Yeshua sent two¦31939 of his¦31940 apprentices¦31941 ahead, telling them,
\v 2 “Go on to the next village¦31952 and as you enter¦31959 it, you'll see a young donkey that hasn't ever been ridden yet. Untie it and bring¦31983 it back here.
\v 3 If anyone¦31988 asks what you're doing¦31993, tell them that the master¦32001 needs it and he'll return it later.”
\p
\v 4 So they went ahead and found¦32020 a donkey tied up on the path just outside¦32027 the door¦32026 of a house, and so they went to untie it.
\v 5 But some of the people standing around there¦32038 said, “Hoy! What do you think you're doing¦32044 untying that donkey?”
\p
\v 6 So they¦32061 responded just as Yeshua¦32059 had told them, and¦32060 the people allowed¦32061 them to proceed.
\v 7 They brought the young donkey to Yeshua, placing their¦32080 coats¦32078 over it before Yeshua mounted it.
\v 8 \add As Yeshua rode it into Jerusalem,\add* many people laid their¦32096 coats¦32094 on the road¦32103, while others¦32105 lay down leafy¦32107 branches¦32107 cut from trees in nearby fields¦32113.
\v 9 \x + \xo 11:9: \xt Psa 118:25-26.\x*Some went ahead and others came along behind, shouting, “This is the saviour¦32129 who comes with the authority and blessing¦32130 from God—
\v 10 the promised ancestor of King David who is blessed as he ushers in his¦32146 kingdom¦32140—the blessed saviour¦32148 from heaven.”
\p
\v 11 And so Yeshua arrived in Jerusalem and went into the temple¦32163 and looked¦32165 all around¦32165, but because it was now evening¦32167, he went back out to Bethania village with his twelve¦32179 apprentices.
\s1 Yeshua curses a fig tree
\r (Mat. 21:18-19)
\p
\v 12 The next day¦32182 after they'd left Bethania, Yeshua was hungry.
\v 13 From a distance he noticed a fig¦32196 tree¦32196 that was in leaf so he went over to see if there was any fruit on it, but when he reached it there was only leaves because it wasn't the right season¦32240 for figs¦32244.
\v 14 So he spoke to the tree, “No one in this age will ever eat¦32271 fruit¦32269 from you again.” (His¦32278 followers¦32277 heard him say that.)
\s1 Yeshua upsets the traders inside the temple
\r (Mat. 21:12-17; Luk. 19:45-48; Jn 2:13-22)
\p
\v 15 Then they came back into Jerusalem and on into the temple where Yeshua started driving out the sellers and the buyers that were trading in there. Then he tipped over the tables¦32312 of the money-changers¦32314 and the chairs of the ones selling doves¦32323,
\v 16 and stopped others from carrying¦32332 goods through the temple¦32339.
\v 17 \x + \xo 11:17: a \xt Isa 56:7; \xo b \xt Jer 7:11.\x*He said, “Isn't it written¦32347 in the Scriptures,
\q1 ‘My house will be known as a house of prayer¦32353 for all the nations¦32357’?
\m But all of you have turned it into a sanctuary for swindlers.”
\p
\v 18 When the chief¦32370 priests¦32370 and the religious teachers heard¦32368 this, they started looking for a way that they could destroy¦32380 him, because they were afraid of him and the way that the crowd¦32389 marvelled at this teaching.
\p
\v 19 Every evening¦32399, Yeshua and his apprentices would go out of the city¦32407 to stay overnight.
\s1 Yeshua gives a lesson on moving mountains
\r (Mat. 21:20-22)
\p
\v 20 As they¦32416 entered the city again in the morning¦32414, Yeshua's apprentices noticed that the fig¦32418 tree¦32418 was totally dead.
\v 21 Peter remembered what he had said to the tree, and commented, “Teacher, that fig¦32432 tree that you cursed¦32434 has withered¦32435 up.”
\p
\v 22 Yeshua responded, “Use your faith¦32445 in God.
\v 23 \x + \xo 11:23: \xt Mat 17:20; 1Cor 13:2.\x*I can assure you¦32451 that if anyone tells a mountain¦32458 to go into the sea¦32467 and doesn't doubt¦32470 in their mind but believes¦32478 that what they're saying¦32450 will happen, then it¦32470 will.
\v 24 So I tell you all that anything you ask God for in your prayers, if you believe¦32506 that you have received¦32508 it¦32513, then you will.
\v 25 \x + \xo 11:25-26: \xt Mat 6:14-15.\x*Whenever you are standing¦32519 praying¦32520, if you have something against¦32526 someone, be sure to forgive them so that your father¦32531 in heaven¦32537 can also forgive your shortcomings.”
\s1 The leaders question Yeshua's authority
\r (Mat. 21:23-27; Luk. 20:1-8)
\p
\v 26 ≈
\v 27 They continued on into Jerusalem¦32568 and on to the temple¦32572 where they¦32564 were met by the chief¦32579 priests¦32579 and the religious teachers and the elders¦32585.
\v 28 They asked Yeshua, “Do you have any authority to do what you did? If so, who gave it to you?”
\p
\v 29 Yeshua¦32613 answered¦32627, “Ok, I'll also ask you something and when you answer¦32627 me I'll tell you about my authority¦32637 to do that:
\v 30 When John \add preached and\add* immersed¦32641 people, did the authority for that come from heaven¦32648 or from people here?”
\p
\v 31 They discussed this among themselves¦32662, reasoning¦32658, “If we say¦32668 it was from heaven¦32670, he'll ask us why we didn't believe¦32679 him¦32680.
\v 32 But we¦32683 can't say¦32683 that it was just from people.” (They said that because they were scared of the crowds¦32690, knowing that they believed that John was a prophet¦32703.)
\v 33 So they¦32710 answered¦32706, “We don't know.”
\p And Yeshua¦32716 also responded, “Well then, I won't tell you¦32724 about my authority¦32729 to do those things¦32731 either.”

\s1 The parable about the tenants killing the owner's son
\r (Mat. 21:33-46; Luk. 20:9-19)
\p
\v 1 \x + \xo 12:1: \xt Isa 5:1-2.\x*Then he started telling them some parables¦32737: “A man¦32742 planted¦32744 a vineyard¦32740 and put a fence¦32749 and a moat around¦32747 it and built¦32755 a \add security\add* tower¦32756. Then he rented¦32758 it out and went off travelling¦32764.
\v 2 At harvest time, he sent a slave¦32772 to go to the tenant farmers and get his \add percentage\add* of the harvest.
\v 3 But the tenants grabbed the slave and beat him up, then sent¦32797 him back empty-handed¦32798.
\v 4 The owner sent¦32803 a second slave¦32807, but they¦32812 insulted this one and struck¦32812 him on the head.
\v 5 So the owner sent a third slave and they murdered him. He sent many other slaves—some they just beat up and others they murdered.
\v 6 But the owner still¦32844 had his one, dearly loved¦32853 son, so finally he sent¦32856 him to go, thinking that they would now be convinced because it was his son.
\v 7 But the tenant¦32874 farmers¦32874 said¦32882 to each others, ‘Ah ha. This is the one who will inherit¦32895 this land. If we kill¦32889 \em him¦32890\em*, we'll be the ones to control the estate.’
\v 8 So they took him and killed¦32899 him, and threw the body outside¦32905 the vineyard¦32907 fence.
\p
\v 9 “Now, what do you think the owner of the vineyard will do? Yes, he'll come and eliminate those \add evil\add* tenants¦32919, and give the contract to others¦32924.
\v 10 \x + \xo 12:10-11: \xt Psa 118:22-23.\x*Haven't¦32931 you all read this in the scriptures¦32927:
\q1 ‘the stone¦32931 that the builders¦32935 rejected¦32933
\q1 became the \add important\add* cornerstone¦32940
\q1
\v 11 that was given by the master¦32942,
\q1 and¦32945 we think it's incredible.’?”
\p
\v 12 And those leaders tried to arrest him because they knew¦32959 that it was them that the parable¦32965 was addressed to, but they couldn't do it because \add Yeshua had the favour\add* of the crowd¦32958, so they just left the area.
\s1 Yeshua answers about payment of taxes
\r (Mat. 22:15-22; Luk. 20:20-26)
\p
\v 13 Then the religious leaders sent some members of the Pharisee party¦32980 and¦32981 some of the \add political\add* supporters¦32983 of King Herod to try to catch¦32987 Yeshua out.
\v 14 So they \add flattered\add* him, “Teacher¦33003, we know that you are honest even if it upsets others, and that you teach¦33027 the truth¦33022 about God without caring¦33010 about people's¦33019 opinions. Is it legal \add for us Jews\add* to pay the poll tax to the Roman emperor or not? How should we handle this?”
\p
\v 15 But knowing their¦33052 hypocrisy¦33054, Yeshua responded to them, “Why are you¦33059 trying to test me? Bring me a coin so we can determine the proper answer.”
\p
\v 16 When they brought¦33070 him a coin, he asked, “Whose image¦33076 and inscription¦33080 are on this coin?”
\p And they said¦33083, “The emperor's.”
\p
\v 17 “Well then,” said Yeshua, “give to the emperor whatever is due him, but give God what is owed to God.”
\p And they had to admit that that was an outstanding answer.
\s1 Yeshua explains that those who've died are alive
\r (Mat. 22:23-33; Luk. 20:27-40)
\p
\v 18 \x + \xo 12:18: \xt Acts 23:8.\x*Another time, members of the Sadducee sect came to Yeshua and¦33127 asked,
\v 19 \x + \xo 12:19: \xt Deu 25:5.\x*“Teacher¦33133, Moses wrote¦33135 that if a man's married brother should die before his wife without having any children¦33155, then his brother should marry her¦33160 to produce descendants in his brother's name.
\v 20 Now what if there were seven¦33175 brothers¦33177 and the first¦33184 one got married and died childless.
\v 21 So then the second¦33196 brother took¦33197 her¦33198 in, but again died¦33200 childless, and then the third¦33211.
\v 22 Eventually all seven¦33220 brothers died childless, and finally the woman¦33232 also died.
\v 23 Now, at the resurrection¦33237 of the dead, which¦33241 brother will she be the wife of, because at some point, she was married to each of the seven¦33249 of them?”
\p
\v 24 So Yeshua¦33259 answered, “Actually you're all quite wrong, because you ignore the scriptures¦33270 and also because you haven't experienced God's power¦33273.
\v 25 When the dead¦33280 do come back to life, they won't be getting engaged or married, but will be like the angels¦33296 in heaven¦33300.
\v 26 \x + \xo 12:26: \xt Exo 3:6.\x*And as for the state of those who've died, didn't you¦33310 read in the scriptures about Moses when God spoke¦33324 to him¦33325 in front of the \add burning\add* thorn¦33320 bush and said, ‘I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob’?
\v 27 So God is not the God of the dead¦33346, but¦33347 of the living¦33349. You Sadducees are very wrong!”
\s1 Yeshua answers about genuine obedience to God
\r (Mat. 22:34-40; Luk. 10:25-28)
\p
\v 28 Then one of the religious teachers who had heard¦33360 their¦33362 question and Yeshua's excellent answer¦33371, came closer and asked¦33373, “Which¦33377 of the commandments¦33379 is the most important?”
\p
\v 29 \x + \xo 12:29-30: \xt Deu 6:4-5.\x*Yeshua answered¦33387, “Well, the most important is this: ‘Listen, Israel. There's only one God who is our¦33410 master.
\v 30 You must love God your master¦33416 with all your heart¦33423 and with all your soul¦33430 and with all your mind and with all your strength¦33443.’
\v 31 \x + \xo 12:31: \xt Lev 19:18.\x*And the second¦33449 is: ‘Love your¦33460 neighbour¦33459 like \add you¦33460 look after\add* yourself¦33462.’ There's no other commandments¦33467 more important than these¦33465.”
\p
\v 32 \x + \xo 12:32: \xt Deu 4:35.\x*The teacher replied to Yeshua, “Yes, teacher, you're quite right saying there's¦33491 only one God and¦33489 no other,
\v 33 \x + \xo 12:33: \xt Hos 6:6.\x* and saying that we should love him¦33498 with all our heart¦33502 and all our intelligence¦33510 and all our strength¦33521, and to be loving our neighbours¦33526 like we \add look after\add* ourselves, and all this is more important¦33531 than all the required temple offerings¦33536 and sacrifices¦33539.”
\p
\v 34 \x + \xo 12:28-34: \xt Luk 10:25-28.\x*When Yeshua saw that he had given such a thoughtful answer¦33547, he said¦33548, “You are very close to the kingdom¦33556 of God!”
\p After that, no one else dared to ask¦33565 Yeshua any more questions.
\s1 Yeshua asks about the messiah being a descendant of David
\r (Mat. 22:41-46; Luk. 20:41-44)
\p
\v 35 Later when Yeshua¦33571 was teaching in the temple¦33577, he asked the people, “How is it that the teachers here say that the messiah¦33585 is a descendant of King David?
\v 36 \x + \xo 12:36: \xt Psa 110:1.\x* Because David himself¦33591 said under the inspiration of the holy spirit¦33598,
\q1 ‘The master told my¦33607 master,
\q2 “Sit there in the position of honour
\q2 until¦33613 I can conquer your¦33612 enemies¦33618.” ’
\m
\v 37 If David calls him his master¦33631, how can he possibly be his descendant?”
\p The large crowd¦33643 was very interested to hear everything that Yeshua had to say.
\s1 Yeshua warns about smartly-dressed teachers
\r (Mat. 23:1-36; Luk. 20:45-47)
\p
\v 38 As Yeshua continued teaching, he said, “Watch out for these religious teachers who like to wear \add fancy\add* robes¦33674 and be greeted¦33677 in the square,
\v 39 and have the best seats¦33683 at meetings and the best places¦33688 at dinners.
\v 40 These¦33707 people trick widows¦33699 out of their properties, but offer long prayers to cover it up. They will be getting a stricter judgement than others.”
\s1 The sacrificial donation of a widow
\r (Luk. 21:1-4)
\p
\v 41 As he sat¦33713 down in front¦33717 of the \add temple\add* treasury, Yeshua watched the crowd¦33729 as they threw coins into \add the dish\add*, and some rich people were donating quite valuable \add silver\add* coins.
\v 42 Then an impoverished widow¦33748 came and threw in two¦33752 small \add copper\add* coins.
\v 43 Yeshua called¦33757 his¦33760 followers¦33759 and told them, “Honestly, that poor widow¦33769 gave more than all the others.
\v 44 You see, most people donate from their¦33802 excess wealth¦33791, but¦33798 this woman¦33797 even gave \add some of\add* the small amount that she¦33805 needed to live on.”
\c 13
\s1 Yeshua predicts total destruction of the temple
\r (Mat. 24:1-2; Luk. 21:5-6)
\p
\v 1 As they were leaving the temple¦33816 area, one of Yeshua's¦33825 followers¦33822 noted, “Teacher¦33825, look at these \add large\add* stones¦33828 and¦33829 the \add beautiful\add* buildings¦33831 that they've been made into.”
\p
\v 2 But Yeshua responded, “Yes, incredible buildings¦33849, but \add the time will come\add* when they're torn down—not a single stone¦33860 will be left sitting in its place.”
\s1 Yeshua talks about coming hardships
\r (Mat. 24:3-14; Luk. 21:7-19)
\p
\v 3 Later when they were over on the Mount¦33884 of Olives¦33886 overlooking the temple¦33889, Peter and Jacob and John and Andrew¦33903 were with Yeshua and asked
\v 4 when all this destruction would happen, and¦33910 what indications there would be that it's about to happen.
\p
\v 5 So Yeshua¦33927 told them, “Be careful so that you¦33938 aren't mislead¦33939 by others.
\v 6 Plenty of people will say that they're coming¦33943 under my¦33947 authority, or that they're me, and¦33954 they'll mislead¦33957 many others.
\v 7 And whenever¦33958 you¦33960 hear¦33960 about wars or about battles about to begin, don't be worried—these things will certainly happen, but¦33972 there's more to follow.
\v 8 Countries will take up arms against other countries, and kingdoms against other kingdom. There'll be earthquakes¦33987 in \add many\add* places¦33989 and there'll¦33991 be famines¦33992, but these¦33998 will be just like the beginning¦33996 of birth¦33997 pains¦33997.
\p
\v 9 \x + \xo 13:9-11: \xt Mat 10:17-20; Luk 12:11-12.\x*“So be careful. You'll be turned over to \add local\add* councils¦34012 \add for questioning\add*, will be whipped in the religious meeting halls, and will be stood¦34025 in front of governors¦34020 and kings¦34024 because of following me. But you'll be able to present your life stories to them
\v 10 and it's right that the good¦34048 news first\f + \fr 13:10 \ft TD: It's not clear here what was meant by ‘first’—‘first’ before what?\f* be proclaimed¦34046 to every country.
\v 11 But whenever¦34054 they bring¦34056 you along to hand¦34061 you over, don't worry¦34061 in advance about what you're going to say to defend yourselves, but wait until the hearing proceeds and speak what you are given¦34070 then, because then it won't be you speaking, but God's spirit¦34089.
\v 12 In those times, a brother will report on his brother to have him executed, and a father¦34100 report on his child¦34101, and children¦34106 will be encouraged to report on their own parents¦34108 and then they'll be executed as a result.
\v 13 \x + \xo 13:13: \xt Mat 10:22.\x*And every one will hate you¦34113 all because¦34117 they hate my¦34120 name¦34119, but whoever endures¦34123 to the end¦34125 will be saved¦34127.
\s1 Yeshua warns about coming horror and deceptions
\r (Mat. 24:15-28; Luk. 21:20-24)
\p
\v 14 \x + \xo 13:14: \xt Dan 9:27; 11:31; 12:11.\x*“But whenever¦34128 you see¦34131 the most horrible thing that drives people from God, standing where¦34147 it¦34149 shouldn't be (and you readers should understand¦34152 this), then anyone in Judea should flee into the hills
\v 15 \x + \xo 13:15-16: \xt Luk 17:31.\x*and anyone upstairs looking outside shouldn't come down into the bedrooms to get anything¦34180,
\v 16 and¦34186 anyone working outside shouldn't go back inside to get a change of clothes.
\v 17 It will be extremely difficult for pregnant women and for mothers who are breast-feeding their children¦34208 in those¦34214 days¦34216.
\v 18 Just pray that it¦34222 won't happen in the winter¦34226
\v 19 \x + \xo 13:19: \xt Dan 12:1; Rev 7:14.\x*because those¦34232 days¦34231 will be terrible like nothing that's ever happened before, all the way back to when God created¦34243 the world right until¦34249 the present time¦34250, and¦34252 won't ever happen again.
\v 20 And if the master¦34263 hadn't shortened that time, no humans would¦34271 even survive, but he shortened that time so that the chosen¦34279 ones could be saved¦34272.
\p
\v 21 So don't believe¦34305 it¦34305 if you¦34291 hear someone say¦34292, ‘Look, the messiah¦34298 has arrived here.’ or ‘There's the one that God has sent.’
\v 22 Plenty of fake messiahs¦34311 and deceiving prophets¦34313 will certainly come and even do things that humans can't normally do, so much so that even the chosen¦34328 ones would defect if that were possible¦34325.
\v 23 So watch¦34331 out, but I've warned you in advance about all of this.
\s1 The universe collapses as the son arrives
\r (Mat. 24:29-31; Luk. 21:25-28)
\p
\v 24 \x + \xo 13:24: a \xt Isa 13:10; Joel 2:10,31; 3:15; Rev 6:12; \xo b \xt Isa 13:10; Eze 32:7.\x*“After those¦34339 very difficult times, the sun¦34347 will go dark and¦34349 the moon¦34351 won't shine at night.
\v 25 \x + \xo 13:25: a \xt Isa 34:4; Rev 6:13; \xo b \xt Joel 2:10.\x*The stars¦34359 will fall down out of the sky¦34364 and the powers¦34371 in the heavens¦34377 will be shaken¦34380 up.
\v 26 \x + \xo 13:26: \xt Dan 7:13; Rev 1:7.\x*Then¦34387 the people will see mankind's child in the clouds¦34392 coming¦34388 with incredible power¦34396 and¦34398 brightness.
\v 27 He'll send the angels¦34406 out to collect all the chosen¦34412 people from the four¦34416 corners of the world, from everywhere between the earth¦34422 and¦34408 the sky.
\s1 Watch out for the change in season
\r (Mat. 24:32-35; Luk. 21:29-33)
\p
\v 28 So learn¦34432 a lesson from fig¦34431 trees—whenever¦34435 the branches¦34439 green up and start sprouting¦34444 leaves¦34446 and then everyone knows that summer¦34455 is close.
\v 29 So too whenever¦34460 you see¦34462 all these¦34464 things¦34464 happening, you know that the end \add of this current world\add* is close.
\v 30 I can assure you that the generation¦34484 of people who see these things won't die off before these latter things happen.
\v 31 The sky and¦34496 the planet might collapse, but¦34502 my¦34504 teachings will never become irrelevant.
\s1 Stay alert for the coming of the master
\r (Mat. 24:36-44)
\p
\v 32 \x + \xo 13:32: \xt Mat 24:36.\x* But as for the date or time when all this will happen, only the father¦34534 knows that—even the son and angels¦34522 don't know.
\v 33 So watch out, observe current events, and¦34539 be praying¦34540, because you¦34542 won't know exactly when all this will happen.
\v 34 \x + \xo 13:34: \xt Luk 12:36-38.\x*It can all be compared to a man¦34558 who was about to leave his house¦34563 and go on a trip. Before he leaves, he gives certain jobs and responsibilities to his various slaves¦34569, and instructs his security guard to stay alert.
\v 35 So you all watch¦34586 and stay alert, because you don't know when the master¦34593 of the house¦34595 might return—perhaps one evening¦34598 or at midnight¦34601, or at dawn or maybe mid-morning.
\v 36 You certainly don't want to be caught napping when he¦34612 comes.
\v 37 And what I'm telling you¦34619 now, I tell everyone: stay alert and watch¦34624.”
\c 14
\s1 The leaders plan to eliminate Yeshua
\r (Mat. 26:1-5; Luk. 22:1-2; Jn 11:45-53)
\p
\v 1 \x + \xo 14:1: \xt Exo 12:1-27.\x*Now it was two¦34633 days¦34634 before the Passover Feast and the Feast of Flat Bread, and the chief¦34638 priests¦34638 and the religious teachers were trying to figure out how they could have Yeshua set up so they could arrest him and have him executed,
\v 2 but they¦34651 knew that the Feast wouldn't be a good time because the people¦34664 would protest in Yeshua's favour.
\s1 The woman anoints Yeshua for his burial
\r (Mat. 26:6-13; Jn 12:1-8)
\p
\v 3 \x + \xo 14:3: \xt Luk 7:37-38.\x*Meanwhile, Yeshua was in Bethany at the home who Simon who had previously had leprosy¦34677. Yeshua was sitting there when a woman¦34681 came¦34680 in with a hand-crafted container of very expensive¦34689 fragrant oil. Breaking open the sealed flask, she¦34699 poured¦34699 the fragrant oil over Yeshua's head.
\v 4 Immediately some started quietly grumbling about the extravagant waste,
\v 5 then they¦34748 scolded the woman because a flask of genuine lotion like this could easily fetch almost a year's wages if it was sold.
\p
\v 6 But Yeshua spoke up, “What do you think you're doing abusing her—leave her alone! She's done something very good¦34764 for me.
\v 7 \x + \xo 14:7: \xt Deu 15:11.\x*You'll always have poor people around, and you can help them whenever¦34781 you want to, but I won't be around forever.
\v 8 She has performed the traditional anointing¦34802 of my body¦34805 in advance of my burial¦34809.
\v 9 And I can assure you¦34813 that wherever¦34815 the good¦34820 news is proclaimed¦34818 around the world¦34825, what she has done today will be part of the story and she'll be remembered.
\s1 Judas offers to hand Yeshua over
\r (Mat. 26:14-16; Luk. 22:3-6)
\p
\v 10 Then Judas Iscariot, one of the Yeshua's twelve¦34846 \add trainees\add*, visited the chief¦34850 priests¦34850 to offer to hand Yeshua over to them.
\v 11 When they heard¦34861 this, they were very pleased and promised¦34865 to pay him well, and Judas asked them about the most convenient¦34875 way for them to get hold of Yeshua.
\s1 Yeshua's trainees prepare the Passover meal
\r (Mat. 26:17-25; Luk. 22:7-14, 21-23)
\p
\v 12 On the first¦34880 day¦34881 of the Feast of Flat Bread when the lambs would be slaughtered ready for the special Passover meal, Yeshua's trainees asked him, “Where¦34893 do you want us to get everything ready for our¦34892 Passover meal?”
\p
\v 13 So Yeshua sent off two¦34905 of them with these instructions, “Go into town and a man¦34926 carrying a pitcher¦34927 of water¦34928 will meet you there. Just follow¦34930 him
\v 14 until he goes into a house. Then find the owner¦34939 of the house and tell him that the teacher¦34942 wants to know the location of the guestroom¦34947 where¦34933 he and his¦34955 trainees can celebrate the Passover meal.
\v 15 He'll show you a large¦34967, furnished¦34968 room upstairs—that's where you can get everything ready¦34970.
\p
\v 16 So the two of them went off into the town, and everything happened there exactly as Yeshua had told them, and so they prepared¦34994 the special meal there.
\s1 Yeshua shocks his trainees at the Passover meal
\r (Mat. 26:20-30; Luk. 22:14-23; Jn 13:21-30; 1 Kur. 11:23-25)
\p
\v 17 As the evening¦34998 approached, Yeshua went in for dinner with his twelve¦35005 trainees.
\v 18 \x + \xo 14:18: \xt Psa 41:9.\x*As they were sitting around eating, he¦35026 told them, “I will tell you frankly that one of you eating with me here will hand me over \add to be arrested\add*.”
\v 19 That upset them, and¦35037 several of them individually asked, “Surely¦35044 it couldn't be me?”
\p
\v 20 Then he continued, “It's one of the twelve¦35061—the one who dips his bread in the sauce at the same time as me.
\v 21 Indeed it's written¦35084 \add in the scriptures\add* that mankind's child will be arrested, but on the other¦35089 hand, what a tragedy it will be for the one who hands him over—in fact it would be better¦35100 for that man if he was never born.”
\p
\v 22 As the carried on eating¦35111, he took a bread roll, blessed¦35117 \add God\add*, broke¦35120 the roll apart and gave a piece to them, saying, “Take this bread—it's my¦35135 body¦35134.”
\p
\v 23 Then he picked up a cup, gave¦35141 thanks¦35140 \add to God\add*, and passed it around so they could each drink from it,
\v 24 \x + \xo 14:24: a \xt Exo 24:8; \xo b \xt Jer 31:31-34.\x*saying, “This is the blood¦35156 of my¦35157 contract that will be poured¦35166 out for many \add people\add*.
\v 25 I can assure you¦35175 that I won't drink anything made from grapes until¦35188 I drink new juice in God's kingdom¦35198.”
\p
\v 26 And after they'd sung some songs, they left the town and went across to the Mount¦35206 of Olives¦35208.
\s1 Yeshua predicts Peters denials
\r (Mat. 26:31-35; Luk. 22:31-34; Jn 13:36-38)
\p
\v 27 \x + \xo 14:27: \xt Zech 13:7.\x*Then Yeshua continued his teaching, “All of you¦35218 will stumble¦35218 because¦35227 it's written¦35228 in the scriptures: ‘I will strike¦35229 down the shepherd¦35231 and¦35232 the sheep¦35236 will be scattered¦35238.’
\v 28 \x + \xo 14:28: \xt Mat 28:16.\x*But after¦35241 I come back to life, I'll go on ahead of you¦35248 back to Galilee¦35251.”
\p
\v 29 But Peter contradicted him¦35258, “Even if everyone else stumbles¦35264, I won't!”
\p
\v 30 And Yeshua¦35275 responded, “I can assure you that you'll renounce¦35296 me three¦35292 times¦35292 this very night¦35285, before¦35287 the rooster¦35290 crows early tomorrow morning.”
\p
\v 31 But Peter argued forcibly, “Even if I had to die¦35316 with you, I would never disown you!”
\p And all the others said similar things.
\s1 Yeshua, in distress, prays at Gethsemane
\r (Mat. 26:36-46; Luk. 22:39-46)
\p
\v 32 They walked along until¦35347 they came to a piece of land called Gethsemane¦35338 where Yeshua told his¦35343 trainees to sit down while he prayed.
\v 33 He took Peter and Jacob and John further in with him¦35361 where he¦35351 stared off in a daze but was obviously very distressed¦35367.
\v 34 He told the three of them, “My¦35376 soul¦35375 is deathly¦35378 sad! You guys just stay here and¦35381 keep alert.”
\p
\v 35 He went ahead a little¦35386 way where he knelt on the ground¦35394 with his head down and prayed—asking if it was possible¦35400 to avoid what was ahead of him.
\v 36 But he¦35411 said, “Father, I know that you can do anything. Let me avoid this suffering, but yes I know, it doesn't matter what I want¦35441 but what you've \add planned\add*.”
\p
\v 37 Then he went back and found the others sleeping. He asked Peter, “Simon, are you asleep? Couldn't you stay awake even for a single hour¦35459?
\v 38 You all need to stay alert and be careful not to give into temptation¦35469. I know your spirits¦35472 are enthusiastic on one hand, but it's still easy to give in to the moment.”
\p
\v 39 Then he went further in again¦35479 and prayed¦35481 as before,
\v 40 but when he returned again¦35487, he found¦35490 them all asleep because they were tired, but they couldn't really find any excuse to give.
\p
\v 41 The third¦35514 time that Yeshua returned, he said to them, “Ah, you're all sleeping¦35518 again and having a good rest. It's well earned but the time has come for mankind's child to be handed over to evil men.
\v 42 Come on—get up—we¦35544 need to go! Look, the one who'll hand me over is on his way.
\s1 Yeshua is arrested in the night
\r (Mat. 26:47-56; Luk. 22:47-53; Jn 18:3-12)
\p
\v 43 Even while Yeshua was still¦35556 speaking¦35558, Judas reached him, followed by a crowd¦35572 from the the chief¦35581 priests¦35581, and the religious teachers, and the elders¦35588—many armed with swords¦35575 and clubs¦35577.
\v 44 Judas had prearranged a signal¦35596 with them that whoever he greeted with a kiss¦35602, they should grab that person and lead him away under guard.
\p
\v 45 So he walked right up to Yeshua¦35623 and said, “My honoured teacher,” and greeted him with a kiss.
\v 46 Then the others with him grabbed Yeshua and secured him.
\v 47 But one of the ones with Yeshua that was beside him¦35664, drew his¦35660 sword¦35653 and¦35662 struck a slave¦35659 of the chief¦35661 priest¦35661, cutting off the man's ear¦35666.
\v 48 Yeshua spoke to the crowd, “Did¦35672 you all bring swords¦35681 and¦35682 clubs¦35683 to try to capture¦35684 me like you'd chase down a thief?
\v 49 \x + \xo 14:49: \xt Luk 19:47; 21:37.\x*I was standing there teaching¦35694 in the temple¦35693 every¦35686 day¦35687 and you could have arrested me, but it's happened this way to ensure that the what's written in scriptures¦35704 will be fulfilled¦35702.
\p
\v 50 Meanwhile, the ones with Yeshua had taken off.
\v 51 One young¦35720 fellow was wearing a single linen¦35729 robe, and when the crowd tried to grab him,
\v 52 it came off \add in the struggle\add* and he ran away stark naked¦35746.
\s1 The mock trial where Yeshua is sentenced to death
\r (Mat. 26:57-68; Luk. 22:54-55,63-71; Jn 18:13-14,19-24)
\p
\v 53 The guards led Yeshua¦35753 away to the chief priest's¦35756 residence, and all the chief priests¦35766 and the elders¦35771 and the religious teachers gathered there also.
\v 54 Peter¦35778 followed¦35781 along from a distance and went in as far as the courtyard¦35788 of the residence where he joined the servants who were sitting¦35794 around the fire¦35803 keeping warm.
\v 55 Inside, the chief¦35806 priests¦35806 and all the council¦35810 were trying to establish a case against¦35812 Yeshua¦35814 so he could be sentenced to death¦35820, but they weren't coming up with anything.
\v 56 Several were making up charges against¦35831 him¦35832, but¦35833 none of the accusers' stories agreed with each other.
\p
\v 57 Eventually some of them stood¦35842 up and offered this false¦35843 charge:
\v 58 \x + \xo 14:58: \xt Jn 2:19.\x*“We heard¦35851 him¦35852 say that he would demolish this temple¦35860 made by many labourers, and within three¦35866 days¦35867 he'd build¦35871 another¦35868 one without any helpers.”
\v 59 But even then, they couldn't get their¦35880 accusations to align with each other.
\p
\v 60 Nevertheless the chief¦35884 priest¦35884 in the middle of the council stood¦35882 up and asked¦35888 Yeshua, “Aren't you going to defend yourself? These men¦35897 are accusing you of these¦35897 things.”
\p
\v 61 But Yeshua didn't say anything. So the chief¦35916 priest¦35916 asked again, “Is it true that you're the chosen¦35930 one that God promised to send—the son of the blessed¦35936 \add God\add*?”
\p
\v 62 \x + \xo 14:62: \xt Dan 7:13.\x*Yeshua¦35940 replied, “I am. And you¦35948 will all see mankind's child sitting¦35956 in the honoured postion by the powerful¦35958 God and coming¦35960 through the clouds¦35964 in the sky¦35967.”
\p
\v 63 Then the chief¦35970 priest¦35970 tore his own robe \add to show his disgust\add* and shouted, “We certainly don't need any more witnesses¦35982 now!
\v 64 \x + \xo 14:64: \xt Lev 24:16.\x*You yourselves all heard¦35985 him¦36005 insult God. What sentence does that deserve?”
\p So the leaders there agreed that Yeshua needed to be sentenced to death¦36010.
\p
\v 65 Then various people started spitting¦36014 on him, and blindfolding¦36017 him and beating¦36025 him saying¦36029, “Ha, tell us who that was!” Even the servants joined in to slap him.
\s1 The pegpahunware of Pidru concerning of Yeshua
\r (Mat. 26:69-75; Luk. 22:56-62; Jn 18:15-18,25-27)
\p
\v 66 Meanwhile, Peter¦36052 was down in the courtyard¦36056 when one of the chief¦36066 priest's¦36066 servant¦36063 girl came out,
\v 67 and seeing Peter warming¦36071 himself¦36071, she¦36075 looked more closely and said, “Hey, you were with that Yeshua¦36089 from Nazareth¦36083!”
\p
\v 68 But he denied it, “I don't know him and I don't know why you think I would!” And he moved away from the fire.
\p
\v 69 But the girl¦36121 that had seen¦36122 him¦36123 said to some of the others standing around, “That guy's one of them.”
\p
\v 70 But again Peter denied it.
\p A little¦36152 while later, some of those standing there said, “You must be one of them because you're from Galilee¦36167.”
\p
\v 71 Now Peter started swearing¦36181 and cursing¦36177 and said, “I've never even met that fellow that you're all talking about!”
\p
\v 72 And right then the rooster crowed¦36196 for the second¦36194 time¦36194. Peter remembered now what Yeshua had told him—how he would renounce¦36224 Yeshua three¦36222 times¦36222 before the rooster crows—and he broke¦36227 down and cried.

\s1 Pilate tries to interrogate Yeshua
\r (Mat. 27:1-2,11-14; Luk. 23:1-5; Jn 18:28-38)
\p
\v 1 First thing in the morning¦36236, the chief¦36242 priests¦36242 called a meeting with the elders¦36245 and the religious teachers and all the council¦36254, and they ordered that Yeshua¦36258 be tied up and taken over to Governor Pilate¦36268.
\v 2 There Pilate¦36273 asked¦36270 him, “Are you the king¦36278 of the Jews?”
\p “You said it¦36289,” replied Yeshua.
\p
\v 3 Then the chief¦36295 priests¦36295 started hurling accusations¦36291 against¦36293 Yeshua.
\v 4 So Pilate¦36303 asked¦36305 him¦36307 again, “Don't you have anything to say? Listen to all these accusations¦36317 they're making against you.”
\p
\v 5 But Pilate¦36328 was astounded that Yeshua¦36321 didn't answer¦36324 any further.
\s1 Pilate agrees to execute an innocent man
\r (Mat. 27:15-26; Luk. 23:13-25; Jn 18:39–19:16)
\p
\v 6 Now at time of the Jewish Passover, Pilate would normally pardon one prisoner¦36340 for them and release him.
\v 7 There was another prisoner at the time named Barabbas¦36352 who was an activist accused of murder¦36362.
\v 8 By now, the crowd¦36371 had arrived and asked Pilate to release a prisoner as usual at Passover.
\v 9 So he asked them, “Do you want me to release the King of the Jews for you?”
\v 10 This was because Pilate was well aware that the chief¦36407 priests¦36407 had brought Yeshua because they were jealous of his \add popularity\add*.
\v 11 But the chief¦36410 priests¦36410 stirred¦36412 up the crowd¦36415 to start saying that it was Barabbas¦36421 that they wanted released.
\v 12 So Pilate¦36426 asked again¦36427, “Then what should I do with this man that you¦36438 call the King of the Jews?”
\p
\v 13 The crowd yelled back, “Execute¦36450 him¦36451 on a pole.”
\p
\v 14 Pilate¦36454 demanded, “What has he¦36460 even done wrong?”
\p But they¦36462 just yelled louder, “Execute¦36469 him¦36470 on a pole!”
\p
\v 15 Now Pilate¦36473 wanted to placate the crowd¦36481, so he had Barabbas¦36487 released while he had Yeshua flogged¦36494 and then handed over to the execution¦36498 squad.
\s1 The battalion plays with their mock “king”
\r (Mat. 27:27-31; Jn 19:2-3)
\p
\v 16 So the soldiers¦36501 led Yeshua inside the palace¦36508 that was the governor's¦36512 residence¦36512, and¦36513 called in the rest of the battalion.
\v 17 They \add mocked Yeshua\add* by dressing¦36520 him in a kingly robe, and after someone twisted¦36528 some thorns¦36529 together¦36528 into a mock crown¦36530, they pressed it onto his head,
\v 18 and¦36531 began¦36532 saluting him¦36534, “Greetings¦36537, King of the Jews.”
\v 19 They took turns whacking his¦36545 head with a stick and spitting¦36554 on him, while others knelt down in front of him and pretended to be bowing to him.
\v 20 After they'd finished having fun mocked¦36565 him, they took the purple¦36570 robe off him, and put his¦36577 own robe back on him. Then they led him outside towards the execution¦36585 spot.
\s1 Yeshua is publicly executed along with thieves
\r (Mat. 27:32-44; Luk. 23:26-43; Jn 19:17-27)
\p
\v 21 \x + \xo 15:21: \xt Rom 16:13.\x*As they walked out of the city, they came across a man¦36592 coming¦36598 in from the country¦36601. He was Simon from Cyrene, the father¦36603 of Alexander¦36604 and Rufus, and the soldiers forced him¦36611 to carry¦36608 the execution pole,
\v 22 and so they¦36614 all arrived at Golgotha¦36620 (which¦36622 means “Place¦36627 of the skull¦36627”).
\v 23 There the soliders went to give some spiced wine to Yeshua, but¦36639 he¦36641 declined it.
\v 24 \x + \xo 15:24: \xt Psa 22:18.\x*So they¦36647 carried out the execution¦36643, taking Yeshua's clothes¦36650 and¦36657 drawing straws to see who would get what.
\v 25 By now it¦36660 was 9am, and¦36665 they¦36667 affixed Yeshua to the pole.
\v 26 The charge¦36675 had been written out and attached \add at the top\add*: “The King of the Jews.”
\v 27 That morning, two¦36690 thieves were also executed¦36687 there—one on each side of Yeshua.
\p
\v 28 ≈
\v 29 \x + \xo 15:29: a \xt Psa 22:7; 109:25; \xo b \xt Mrk 14:58; Jn 2:19.\x*As people passed by on the path, they insulted Yeshua, shaking¦36718 their¦36721 heads¦36720 and shouting, “Hoy there! You who reckoned you¦36726 could demolish the temple¦36729 and rebuild it¦36731 in three¦36733 days¦36734.
\v 30 Come down from that pole and save¦36736 yourself¦36737.”
\p
\v 31 Similarly the chief¦36748 priests¦36748 and the religious teachers laughed together and mocked, “He did miracles for others¦36757, but he can't even save¦36762 himself¦36759.
\v 32 The so-called ‘chosen one’ or ‘King of Israel’. Now, if he'd just come¦36769 down from there, then we'd be able to believe¦36778 him.”
\p Even the other two being executed¦36782 with him were deriding¦36785 him.
\s1 Yeshua breathes his last
\r (Mat. 27:45-56; Luk. 23:44-49; Jn 19:28-30)
\p
\v 33 At noon, it got dark everywhere, until¦36801 3pm,
\v 34 \x + \xo 15:34: \xt Psa 22:1.\x*when Yeshua shouted¦36811 loudly, “My¦36830 God, my¦36830 God, why have you¦36837 abandoned¦36837 me?”
\p
\v 35 Some of the people standing nearby thought he was calling¦36853 the prophet Elijah.
\v 36 \x + \xo 15:36: \xt Psa 69:21.\x*One of them ran, and soaked a sponge¦36863 in some sour wine, then put it on a stick and held it up for Yeshua to drink¦36869, saying¦36871, “Hang on. Let's see¦36875 if Elijah does come to get him down.”
\p
\v 37 But just then Yeshua¦36883 uttered a loud¦36886 cry¦36885 and exhaled his last breath.
\p
\v 38 \x + \xo 15:38: \xt Exo 26:31-33.\x*(Back in the temple¦36892, the curtain¦36890 tore down the middle from the top to the bottom¦36901.)
\v 39 The Roman centurion¦36905 who had been standing back watching everything, said¦36921 when Yeshua died, “This man¦36925 was definitely God's son.”
\p
\v 40 \x + \xo 15:40-41: \xt Luk 8:2-3.\x*Further back, there was also a group of women¦36936 observing¦36939 everything. These included Mary from Magdala¦36947, Mary the mother¦36959 of young Jacob and Joses, and Salome,
\v 41 and others who had followed¦36969 Yeshua around Galilee¦36968 and helped look after¦36971 him, along with many others who had come¦36981 down with him to Jerusalem.
\s1 Joseph boldly lays the body in a burial chamber
\r (Mat. 27:57-61; Luk. 23:50-56; Jn 19:38-42)
\p
\v 42 As evening¦36987 came, it was now the Preparation Day, i.e., the day before the Rest Day.
\v 43 Joseph (who'd come¦37000 from the city of Arimathea¦37005 and one who was waiting¦37014 for the coming of God's kingdom¦37016), a prominent¦37007 council¦37008 member¦37008, steeled himself¦37012 up and went in to see the governor to get permission to transfer Yeshua's body¦37029.
\v 44 Governor Pilate¦37034 didn't think he'd be dead yet, so he called¦37043 an army commander to find out if Yeshua had indeed died.
\v 45 As soon as he found out, he gave Joseph¦37068 permission.
\v 46 So Joseph \add and his¦37111 companions\add* went and bought¦37073 some linen burial cloth and then, removing Yeshua's body from the pole, wrapped¦37081 it in the cloth and placed it in a burial chamber that had been chiseled into a rockface. Then they rolled¦37104 a rock¦37102 across the opening.
\v 47 Others were watching and noted where¦37133 the body had been laid, including Mary from Magdala¦37119 and Mary the mother¦37122 of Joses.
\c 16
\s1 The massive shock at the burial chamber
\r (Mat. 28:1-8; Luk. 24:1-12; Jn 20:1-10)
\p
\v 1 After the Rest Day was over, Mary from Magdala¦37145 and Mary the mother¦37148 of Jacob and Salome, went and bought¦37153 some traditional burial spices¦37154 that evening to take to the burial chamber and place with the body.
\v 2 Then very early¦37164 on Sunday morning they¦37172 went to the chamber, arriving just as the sun¦37181 was rising.
\v 3 But they realised that they didn't have anyone with them to roll the rock away that was covering the entrance.
\v 4 However, when they looked¦37204 they saw that the very large¦37216 rock had already been rolled¦37208 away.
\v 5 So they went on into the burial chamber and were toally stunned to find a young¦37234 man¦37234 dressed in white¦37242, sitting¦37236 in there on the side.
\p
\v 6 He assured them, “Don't be surprised. I know you're looking for Yeshua from Nazareth¦37264, the one who was executed¦37267 on a pole. But see¦37272 there where¦37280 his body was—he's not there because he came back to life.
\v 7 \x + \xo 16:7: \xt Mat 26:32; Mrk 14:28.\x*So you three should go and tell his¦37289 trainees, and Peter in particular, that he's going to go up ahead of them to Galilee¦37300 and you'll all see him up there¦37301, just as he already told you.”
\p
\v 8 So they left the chamber and took off running, still stunned and shaking and too scared to stop and to talk to anyone.
\rem It's not certain whether or not the following longer ending of this document was actually penned by Mark, or whether it was appended slightly later. Expert scholars are divided on this, and hence it's included here for your consideration:
\s1 \add The others don't believe that Mary saw Yeshua\add*
\r (Mat. 28:9-10; Jn 20:11-18)
\v 9 \add After coming back to life early on Sunday morning, Yeshua appeared first to Mary from Magdala. (She was the one that he had once commanded seven demons to leave.)\add*
\v 10 \add After leaving him, she went and told his followers who were mourning and weeping at his loss.\add*
\v 11 \add But when she told them that he is alive again and that she'd seen him, they simply didn't believe her.\add*
\s1 \add Yeshua appears to two of his followers\add*
\r (Luk. 24:13-35)
\p
\v 12 \add Later on, Yeshua appeared in a different form to two of his followers on the path as they left Jerusalem and headed out to the countryside,\add*
\v 13 \add but when they hurried back and told the others, no one believed them.\add*
\s1 \add Yeshua appears to his trainees and instructs them\add*
\r (Mat. 28:16-20; Luk. 24:36-49; Jn 20:19-23; Acts 1:6-8)
\p
\v 14 \add Later again when the eleven trainees were sitting around eating, Yeshua appeared in the room and scolded them for not believing and for being so stubborn when they hadn't believed others who had told them that he'd come back from the dead.\add*
\v 15 \x + \xo 16:15: \xt Acts 1:8.\x*\add Then he instructed them, “Travel around all the world and tell the good news to everyone.\add*
\v 16 \add Anyone who believes and gets immersed in water will be saved, however, those who refuse to believe will be condemned to death.\add*
\v 17 \add Those who believe will be able to do miracles: they'll be able to use my authority to command demons to leave and to speak new languages,\add*
\v 18 \add and they'll be able to pick up snakes. If they drink anything poisonous, it won't hurt them, and they will place their hands on people and make them better.\add*
\s1 \add Yeshua is lifted up to heaven\add*
\r (Luk. 24:50-53; Acts 1:9-11)
\p
\v 19 \x + \xo 16:19: \xt Acts 1:9-11.\x*\add When Yeshua had finished speaking, he was lifted up into heaven and seated in the honoured place next to God.\add*
\v 20 \add Then his followers went around preaching everywhere, and God worked through them and so they were able to confirm the truth of their preaching by doing miracles.\add*
