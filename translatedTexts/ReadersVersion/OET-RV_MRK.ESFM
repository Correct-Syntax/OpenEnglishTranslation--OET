\is1 Introduction
\is2 Author
\ip This account about the works and teachings of Jesus was written by Mark, the son of a Jewish family who lived in Jerusalem. His mother was named Mary (<a href="ACT.html#C12V12">Acts 12:12</a>).
\ip Many people think he was John Mark, a cousin of Barnabas (<a href="COL.html#C4V10">Col. 4:10</a>) who accompanied Paul on his first long-distance trip to spread the good news about Jesus the Messiah (<a href="ACT.html#C12V25">Acts 12:25</a>, <a href="ACT.html#C13V13">13:13</a>). We also know that Mark accompanied Peter (<a href="PE1.html#C5V13">1 Peter 5:13</a>), and some consider that it might have been Peter who narrated to Mark what Jesus had done and taught.
\is2 This account
\ip This account seems to have been written for non-Jews, especially perhaps those familiar with Roman customs. So he didn’t use much ink as Matthew or Luke explaining prophecies from the Jewish scriptures but he does, however, take time to explain Jewish customs to help non-Jewish readers.
\ip Mark explains here that Jesus came to serve both God and the people, and he often refers to him as the “Son of Man”. We can see that especially in <a href="#C10V45">10:45</a>: “...” Mark wants his readers to know that Jesus did incredible things, but especially focuses on his teaching. He confirms the power and authority of Jesus by telling about the miracles that he did, his healing of the sick, and his exorcism of demons.
\ip The ending of this narrative is often disputed, and scholars are still debating about whether or not the longer ending (<a href="#C16V9">16:9-20</a>) is original. The \em OET\em* includes the disputed longer ending, but displays it in a smaller font to indicate its debatable status.

\v 1 Here begins the good news about Jesus the Messiah—the son of god:
\s1 The ministry of John the immerser (The return of “Elijah”)
\r (Mat. 3:1-12; Luk. 3:1-18; Jhn. 1:19-28)
\p
\v 2 \x + \xo 1:2: \xt Mal 3:1.\x*The prophet Isaiah wrote:
\q1 “See, I’m sending my messenger to you,
\q1 the one who be be preparing your path.
\q1
\v 3 \x + \xo 1:3: \xt Isa 40:3 (LXX).\x*The voice out in the wilderness shouting,
\q2 ‘Get the path ready for the master;
\q2 Make it smooth for him to travel on.’ ”
\p
\v 4 John turned up in the wilderness announcing that people should get immersed in water in order to show that their sins have been forgiven.
\v 5 And many from the Judean region and from the city of Jerusalem went out to hear him, and they confessed their sins and asked John to immerse them in Jordan river.
\p
\v 6 \x + \xo 1:6: \xt 2Ki 1:8.\x*John was dressed in simple clothes made from camel hair with a leather belt around his waist, and he lived on locusts and wild honey.
\v 7 And he also announced that, “There’s a greater man coming soon—in fact I’m not even good enough to bend down and untie his sandals.
\v 8 I immersed you in water, but he will immerse you all in God’s pure spirit.”
\s1 Jesus gets immersed and then tempted
\r (Mat. 3:13–4:11; Luk. 3:21-22; 4:1-13)
\p
\v 9 Then one day Jesus came from Nazareth in the Galilee region, and he was immersed in the Jordan river by John.
\v 10 As Jesus came up out of the water, he saw the sky being opened up, and God’s spirit coming down on him like a dove.
\v 11 \x + \xo 1:11: \xt Gen 22:2; Psa 2:7; Isa 42:1; Mat 3:17; 12:18; Mrk 9:7; Luk 3:22.\x*And a voice came from the sky saying, “You are my son who I love and am pleased with.”
\p
\v 12 And then the spirit sent him into the wilderness
\v 13 where he was tested by Satan for forty days. He was out there with the wild animals, but angels waited on him there.
\s1 The selection of the first followers / apprentices
\r (Mat. 4:12-22; Luk. 4:14-15; 5:1-11)
\p
\v 14 After John had been arrested, Jesus went back to Galilee, announcing the good news from God
\v 15 \x + \xo 1:15: \xt Mat 3:2.\x*saying, “The promised time is here, and the kingdom of God is now near, so be turning from your sins and believing this good news.”
\p
\v 16 And as he went around the lake of Galilee, Jesus saw Simon and his brother Andrew throwing a net into the lake because they were fishermen.
\v 17 And he said to them, “Come with me and I will be making you fishermen of people.”
\v 18 And so they left their fishing and went off with Jesus.
\p
\v 19 Then a bit further on he saw James Zebedee and his brother John with him in a boat getting their nets ready.
\v 20 Jesus called them and they too went off with him, leaving their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired workers.
\s1 Jesus drives out a demon
\r (Luk. 4:31-37)
\p
\v 21 They went on into Capernaum where he went into the meeting hall and began teaching as soon as the Sabbath started.
\v 22 \x + \xo 1:22: \xt Mat 7:28-29.\x*The congregation was amazed at his teaching, because he taught with authority, not like the regular teachers there.
\p
\v 23 Then a demon-possessed man in the meeting hall suddenly yelled out,
\v 24 “What are we to you, Jesus of Nazareth? You’ve come to destroy us. I know that you’re God’s holy one.”
\p
\v 25 But Jesus scolded it, “Keep quiet!”, and, “Come out of him!”
\p
\v 26 Then the demon threw the man into a convulsion, cried out loudly, and left him.
\v 27 Everyone was astounded, and asked each other, “What just happened? We haven’t heard this before: he has authority to command demons, and they obey him!”
\p
\v 28 And the news about Jesus spread all over the entire region of Galilee.
\s1 Jesus heals many others
\r (Mat. 8:14-17; Luk. 4:38-41)
\p
\v 29 After leaving the meeting hall, Jesus went into the home of Simon and Andrew, along with James and John.
\v 30 Inside, Simon’s mother-in-law was lying down with a fever, and the others spoke to Jesus about her.
\v 31 He went up to her, took hold of her hand, and helped her up. Then the fever subsided and she got them something to eat.
\p
\v 32 That evening when the sun set, the people brought all those who were sick or demon-possessed to Jesus.
\v 33 It seemed like the entire town had gathered there outside the front door.
\v 34 Jesus healed many who were sick from a range of diseases, and he threw out many demons—not allowing them to speak because they knew that he was the Messiah.
\s1 Jesus prays before going preaching
\r (Luk. 4:42-44)
\p
\v 35 In the small hours of the night, Jesus got up and went out to a solitary place and prayed there.
\v 36 But Simon and the others came looking for him,
\v 37 and when they found him they said, “Everyone’s looking for you!”
\p
\v 38 And Jesus answered, “Well, we’ll be going into the other villages around here, so that I can also tell them. That’s what I came here for.”
\v 39 \x + \xo 1:39: \xt Mat 4:23; 9:35.\x*Then he went preaching in all their meeting halls in Galilee and driving out demons.
\s1 Jesus heals a man with leprosy
\r (Mat. 8:1-4; Luk. 5:12-16)
\p
\v 40 A man with leprosy came to Jesus asking him, “I know that you could treat me if you wanted to.”
\p
\v 41 Jesus felt compassion for him, reached out his hand and touched him, and said, “Yes, I will. Get well.”
\v 42 Then immediately the leprosy was gone, and he was well again.
\v 43 So Jesus sent him away, but warned him:
\v 44 \x + \xo 1:44: \xt Lev 14:1-32.\x*“Don’t talk to anyone—just go to the priest and show him that you’re well, and as a testimony of that, make the offering that Moses commanded.”
\p
\v 45 But after the man left, he started telling lots of people and spreading the news—so much so that Jesus could no longer come into the town, but had to stay out in quieter places and people kept coming to him.
\c 2
\s1 Jesus heals a paralysed man
\r (Mat. 9:1-8; Luk. 5:17-26)
\p
\v 1 When Jesus came back to Capernaum after a few days, people soon heard that he was back in the house.
\v 2 And so many people turned up there that there wasn’t any room left—not even in the doorway. Inside, Jesus was explaining the Scriptures to them.
\v 3 Four men arrived, carrying a paralysed man to Jesus,
\v 4 but because of the crowd, they were unable to get close. So they climbed up onto the flat roof, made a hole through it, and lowered the paralysed man lying on a pallet.
\v 5 Jesus, observing their faith, said to the man, “Son, your sins are forgiven!”
\p
\v 6 But some of the religious teachers were sitting there, thinking to themselves,
\v 7 “Why’s he talking like that? He’s seriously insulting God. There’s only one who can forgive sins, and that’s God himself.”
\p
\v 8 Then Jesus, knowing in his spirit that they are thinking like that, said to them, “Why are you thinking that to yourselves?
\v 9 Which is easier: to tell the paralysed man that his sins have been forgiven, or to tell him to pick up his bedding and walk?”
\v 10 But so you all can see that the son of man has authority on the earth to be forgiving sins, he turned and said to the paralysed man,
\v 11 “Listen. Get up, take your bedding, and go home!”
\p
\v 12 So he stood up, and picked up his bedding, and went out of the house where everyone saw him and marvelled and praised God saying, “We’ve never seen anything like this happening before!”
\s1 The calling of Levi (Matthew)
\r (Mat. 9:9-13; Luk. 5:27-32)
\p
\v 13 Jesus went out beside the lake where crowds of people kept coming to him, and he taught them.
\v 14 And as he was passing by the tax office, he saw Levi Alphaeus sitting there and said to him, “Come along with me.” So Levi stood up and followed Jesus.
\p
\v 15 Jesus ended up having a meal at Levi’s place, and many other tax collectors and undesirables were sitting there also, along with Jesus’ followers, because by then many were following him around.
\v 16 And the teachers from the sect of the Pharisees noticed that Jesus was eating beside undesirables and tax collectors. So they asked his followers, “How come he eats with tax collectors and other low-life?”
\p
\v 17 And overhearing them, Jesus said, “Healthy people don’t need a doctor—it’s the sick ones that do. I didn’t come here to call those considered to have no needs, but to call sinners.”
\s1 The question of fasting
\r (Mat. 9:14-17; Luk. 5:33-39)
\p
\v 18 Now the followers of John the Immerser and members of the Pharisees regularly fasted. So a small group came to Jesus and asked, “How come John’s followers and the Pharisees fast regularly, yet your followers don’t?”
\p
\v 19 And Jesus answered, “Can the friends of the groom fast when they’re celebrating along with him? No, as long as he’s still there, they won’t be fasting.
\v 20 But in the future, when the groom will be taken away from them, and \em then\em* they’ll be fasting.
\p
\v 21 “No one sews a patch of new, unshrunken cloth onto an old garment, because the new patch will tear away from that old fabric and it will end up as a worse tear.
\v 22 No one puts new wine into old wineskins, because the wine will burst the \add already stretched\add* wineskins, and both the wine and the wineskins will be destroyed. New wine must be put into \em new\em* wineskins.”
\s1 Working on the Rest Day
\r (Mat. 12:1-8; Luk. 6:1-5)
\p
\v 23 \x + \xo 2:23: \xt Deu 23:25.\x*And it so happened that Jesus and his followers passed through some fields of grain on some days of rest. As they went through, they plucked off some heads of grain.
\v 24 And some members of the Pharisees said, “It’s breaking the law to do that on a rest day!”
\p
\v 25 And Jesus replied, “You’ve read yourselves what David did when him and his men were hungry.
\v 26 \x + \xo 2:26: \xt Lev 24:9.\x*They went into God’s tent and ate the holy bread representing the presence of God. Only the priests were allowed to eat that, and yet David even gave some to his men!”
\v 27 And he told the Pharisees, “The days of rest were created for people, not people for the rest days.
\v 28 So I, the son of man, have authority also over the day of rest.”
\c 3
\s1 The man with the curled-up hand
\r (Mat. 12:9-14; Luk. 6:6-11)
\p
\v 1 And again another time, Jesus went to the meeting hall and there was a man there with a curled-up hand.
\v 2 The religious leaders there were watching him closely to see if he would heal the man on the rest day, and then if he did, they would have a case against him.
\v 3 Then Jesus said to the man with the flawed hand, “Stand up there in the middle.”
\v 4 And he asked the leaders, “Is it allowable to do good on the rest day, or only to do evil? To save life, or to kill.” But they didn’t reply.
\p
\v 5 After angrily looking around at them, grieving inside at their complete lack of compassion, he said to the man, “Open up your hand!”
\v 6 The man stretched out his fingers, and his hand was totally normal. But the Pharisees quickly left and meeting with King Herod’s supporters, they conspired to kill Jesus.
\s1 Big crowds press on Jesus
\p
\v 7 After that, Jesus withdrew towards the lake with his followers, and a huge crowd of people from the regions of both Galilee and down in Judea,
\v 8 along with others from Jerusalem, Idumea, across the Jordan River, and from up near Tyre and Sidon. They came because they had heard about the amazing things he had done.
\v 9 \x + \xo 3:9-10: \xt Mrk 4:1; Luk 5:1-3.\x*So Jesus asked his apprentices to organise a small boat for him to be there for him so he wouldn’t be cramped by the press of the crowd.
\v 10 Virtually anyone who had any physical issues was pressing towards him to touch him, because he had already healed so many.
\v 11 And the demons, whenever they saw Jesus, they fell down to the ground in front of him and yelled out, “You are God’s son!”
\v 12 But he regularly warned them not to reveal who he was.
\s1 Jesus appoints his twelve representatives
\r (Mat. 10:1-4; Luk. 6:12-16)
\p
\v 13 As Jesus started climbing up a hill, he called out the followers that he had selected, and they went off with him.
\v 14 He appointed twelve of them as his representatives so that they could stick with him and be sent off to be proclaiming his message
\v 15 and to also have authority to exorcise demons.
\p
\v 16 These are the twelve that he appointed: Simon (but he appended the name “Peter”),
\v 17 Jacob and his brother John who were Zebedee’s sons (and he nicknamed them the “sons of thunder”),
\v 18 Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, Jacob Alphaeus, Thaddeus, Simon from Canaan,
\v 19 and Judas Iscariot who later betrayed him.
\s1 The two opposing spiritual powers
\r (Mat. 12:22-32; Luk. 11:14-23; 12:10)
\p
\v 20 Jesus was approaching a house, but the crowd swarmed them again so they had no opportunity to eat.
\v 21 The ones with him heard all the noise and came to get him, because they were wondering if he was crazy.
\p
\v 22 \x + \xo 3:22: \xt Mat 9:34; 10:25.\x*And the religious teachers had come up from Jerusalem and were complaining, “He’s possessed by the prince of demons. He can command them because he rules them!”
\p
\v 23 But Jesus addressed them: “How could Satan command himself?
\v 24 If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom could never prosper.
\v 25 If a household is divided against itself, that family will never prosper.
\v 26 So if Satan attacked himself and was split, he couldn’t possibly be powerful, but his time would be over.
\p
\v 27 On the contrary, no one can enter the house of a strong man to clean out his possessions unless he first ties up that strong man—after that he can work on the goods.
\p
\v 28 Honestly, I assure you that any sin of a person can be forgiven, no matter how much they curse God.
\v 29 \x + \xo 3:29: \xt Luk 12:10.\x*But whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit can never be forgiven, but is eternally responsible for their sin.   .”
\v 30 (He said this because they were saying that he was demon-possessed.)
\s1 Jesus’ mother and brothers arrive
\r (Mat. 12:46-50; Luk. 8:19-21)
\p
\v 31 Now Jesus’ mother and brothers came and were standing outside and asked someone to tell him that they were there.
\v 32 Some in the crowd sitting around him told Jesus that his mother and brothers were waiting outside for him.
\p
\v 33 But Jesus answered, “Who is my mother and who are my brothers?”
\v 34 And having looked around the people sitting here, he said, “Actually, you all are my mother and my brothers.
\v 35 For whoever obeys God, that person is my brother and my sister and my mother.”
\c 4
\s1 The allegory about planting seed
\r (Mat. 13:1-9; Luk. 8:4-8)
\p
\v 1 \x + \xo 4:1: \xt Luk 5:1-3.\x*Again Jesus started teaching by the edge of the lake. A huge crowd gathered around him, but he had boarded the boat floating in the water, and all the people were there on the land.
\v 2 And he taught them many different things in allegories, including this one:
\v 3 “Listen. Once there was a farmer who went to spread some seed.
\v 4 As he spread it, some landed on the path, and the birds came and feed on it.
\v 5 Some landed on a rocky part without a lot of soil, and it quickly sprouted in the warm, shallow soil,
\v 6 but when the sun came up, it dried out because the roots weren’t deep, and so it just withered up.
\v 7 Some of the seed landed in a thistle patch, and the thistles grew and choked it out, so the plants never bore a crop.
\v 8 But some seed landing in fertile soil and it bore a harvest—some thirty times as much, some sixty, and some a hundred times.”
\p
\v 9 Then Jesus added, “Whoever wants to understand, let them consider it.”
\s1 Why Jesus speaks in allegories
\r (Mat. 13:10-17; Luk. 8:9-10)
\p
\v 10 And when the crowd had left, the twelve apprentices asked him about the allegories.
\v 11 And he told them, “You’ve been given understanding about the kingdom of God, but for others, they’ll get it in allegories
\q1
\v 12 \x + \xo 4:12: \xt Isa 6:9-10 (LXX).\x*so that when they look they might see but not perceive,
\q1 and when they listen, they might hear but not understand,
\q1 otherwise they might turn \add from their sins\add* and be forgiven.”
\s1 Explaining about the ground where the seed fell
\r (Mat. 13:18-23; Luk. 8:11-15)
\p
\v 13 Then Jesus said to them, “If you didn’t understand this allegory, how will you understand any others?
\v 14 The one spreading seed is spreading the Good News.
\v 15 And there are some along the path where the Good News is being spread, who hear, but Satan turns up immediately and snatches the message from them.
\v 16 And similarly, there’s some the falls onto rocky places where the people who hear the Good News happily accept it,
\v 17 but don’t make strong roots, just temporary \add changes\add*. So when they get mocked or attacked about accepting the Good News, they quickly stumble.
\v 18 Others are the ones where the seed was spread among the thistles. They heard the Good News,
\v 19 but contemporary topics, or the lure of money, or the appetite for other things choke their good intentions and the message becomes unfruitful in them.
\v 20 But lastly, the seed that landed on the good soil represents the people who hear the Good News, accept it and are fruitful thirty, sixty, or even a hundred times over.”
\s1 The light will shine on everything
\r (Luk. 8:16-18)
\p
\v 21 \x + \xo 4:21: \xt Mat 5:15; Luk 11:33.\x*And Jesus told them, “Obviously no one goes and gets a lamp, and then puts it under a basket or under the bed, but rather places it somewhere higher on a stand.
\v 22 \x + \xo 4:22: \xt Mat 10:26; Luk 12:2.\x*You see, nothing is hidden that won’t eventually be disclosed, and there’s no secret that won’t eventually be revealed.
\v 23 Anyone who wants to understand, let them listen carefully.”
\p
\v 24 \x + \xo 4:24: \xt Mat 7:2; Luk 6:38.\x*And he continued, “Take care what you listen to. Because how much you judge others, so too will judgement be handed out to you, and even more.
\v 25 \x + \xo 4:25: \xt Mat 13:12; 25:29; Luk 19:26.\x*Whoever has \add faith\add* will be given \add a reward\add*, but if you have none, even the little you have will be taken away.”
\s1 The allegory concerning the seed
\p
\v 26 And then, “The Kingdom of God is like a person throwing some seed onto the ground.
\v 27 Whether the person sleeps at night or stays up night and day, the seed will sprout and grow either way, and they don’t know how it does it.
\v 28 The earth is \add designed\add* to multiply the seed: first a sprout appears, then a bigger plant, and then the full head of grain.
\v 29 \x + \xo 4:29: \xt Joel 3:13.\x*And when it’s ripe, then the harvester is sent in because it’s ready for harvest.”
\s1 The small seed produces a large result
\r (Mat. 13:31-32,34; Luk. 13:18-19)
\p
\v 30 Again he said, “What could we like the Kingdom of God to? Or what allegory could we explain it with?
\v 31 It’s like planting a mustard seed in the ground—a very small seed.
\v 32 But when it’s planted and grows up, it forms a large bush with many branches so that birds can rest in its shade.”
\p
\v 33 And so as much as they could handle it, Jesus shared the Good News with them via many similar word pictures.
\v 34 He never spoke without these illustrations, but he explained all of them to his close followers.
\s1 Jesus halts the storm on the lake
\r (Mat. 8:23-27; Luk. 8:22-25)
\p
\v 35 It was already becoming evening on that day, so Jesus said \add to his apprentices\add*, “Let’s all go across to the other shore.”
\v 36 So they left the crowd behind and got into the boat with him.
\v 37 \add Out in the lake\add* a big storm came up with strong winds, and the waves started breaking across the boat and filling it.
\v 38 But Jesus slept on in the back, sleeping on a cushion. They woke him and cried, “Teacher, don’t you care that we’re all about to drown?”
\p
\v 39 Now awake, Jesus scolded the wind and waves, “Quieten down! Stop that!” Then the wind died down and the water became very calm.
\v 40 And \add turning back to them\add* he asked, “Why were you all so afraid? Don’t you have any faith yet?”
\p
\v 41 But now they were very afraid \add again\add* and asked each other, “Who could this man be that both the wind and waves obey him?”
\c 5
\s1 Jesus send the demons into the pigs
\r (Mat. 8:28-34; Luk. 8:26-39)
\p
\v 1 So they got \add safely\add* to the region of Gerasenes on the other side of the lake.
\v 2 As Jesus climbed out of the boat, a demon-possessed man came out of the tombs to meet him.
\v 3 He lived in those tombs, and no one could tie him up, not even with chains,
\v 4 because he had often been tied up in the past with shackles and chains but had always pulled the chains apart and smashed the shackles, and no one was able to subdue him.
\v 5 All through the day and night, whether in the tombs or up in the hills, he was yelling out and hurting himself with stones.
\p
\v 6 So when he had seen Jesus in the distance, he ran and \add as a sign of honour\add* fell to the ground in front of him.
\v 7 Then he called out very loudly, “What will happen between us, Jesus, the son of the highest God? I beg you in God’s name not to torment me.”
\v 8 Because Jesus had already started saying, “Come out of the man you ungodly spirit!”
\p
\v 9 Jesus asked, “What’s your name?”
\p The man answered, “My name is ‘Thousands’ because there’s many of us,”
\v 10 and he begged Jesus not to send them out of the country.
\p
\v 11 It just so happened that there was a large herd of pigs being fed on the hill nearby
\v 12 and they begged Jesus again saying, “Send us to the pigs so that we can enter them.”
\v 13 Jesus agreed to that, so the ungodly spirits came out of the man, went into the pigs, and the entire herd of some two thousand pigs rushed down the steep bank into the sea and were drowned.
\p
\v 14 The ones who had been feeding them rushed off and spread the news around in the city and the surrounding area. So the people hurried out to see what had happened.
\v 15 When they arrived where Jesus was, they saw the man who had been demon-possessed fully-clothed and sitting there in full control of his senses. They knew it was the man called ‘Thousands’ and they became frightened.
\v 16 Those who had seen it all happen described it all to the people—what had happened both to the demon-possessed man and to the pigs.
\p
\v 17 So then the people began asking Jesus to go away from their region.
\p
\v 18 As Jesus was climbing back into the boat, the man who had been demon-possessed wanted to go with him.
\p
\v 19 But Jesus wouldn’t let him and told him to head back home to his own people, and explain to them what the Master had done for him and how he had been merciful to him.
\p
\v 20 So he went away and shared with the people of the Ten Cities region what Jesus had done for him, and they were all amazed.
\s1 A woman is healed as Jesus goes to help a dying girl
\r (Mat. 9:18-26; Luk. 8:40-56)
\p
\v 21 When Jesus had crossed in the boat to the other side of the lake, a large crowd of people came out to the lake edge to see him.
\v 22 A religious leader named Jairus came out, and when he found Jesus he fell down at his feet
\v 23 and pleaded, “My young daughter is critical and just hanging on for you to come and touch her so that she can be healed and live.”
\p
\v 24 So Jesus went off with Jairus. The large crowd followed also and many were getting pressed against Jesus.
\p
\v 25 Then a woman came who had been losing blood for twelve years
\v 26 and who had endured much under various doctors despite spending everything she had. After all that, she’d ended up even worse,
\v 27 but when she heard about what Jesus had been doing, she worked her way through the crowd to the back of Jesus and touched his clothes,
\v 28 because she had told herself, “If I could even just touch his clothes, I would be healed.”
\p
\v 29 And immediately the bleeding stopped and she knew that she had been healed.
\v 30 Immediately also, Jesus knew that power had gone out of him, and he turned back towards the crowd and said, “Who touched my clothes?”
\p
\v 31 But his followers said, “You can see all the people that were pressing on you so why would you ask who touched you?”
\p
\v 32 But Jesus was still looking around to see who had done it.
\v 33 And the woman, scared and shaking because of what was happening, came and fell down in front of Jesus and told him the whole story.
\v 34 Jesus said, “Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace and full health.”
\p
\v 35 While he was still speaking, messengers came from Jairus’ house to tell him, “Your daughter has died. Why bother the teacher any more?”
\p
\v 36 But Jesus overheard them telling this to the leader and told him, “Don’t be afraid—keep believing.”
\v 37 And Jesus didn’t allow anyone to accompany him other than Peter, and James and his brother, John.
\v 38 As they approached Jairus’ house, Jesus saw a big commotion with lots of crying and yelling going on.
\v 39 As he entered, he said, “Why are you all crying in distress? The child hasn’t died—she’s just sleeping!”
\p
\v 40 But they just ridiculed Jesus. So he sent them all outside, just taking the father and mother of the child, along with three with him. He went in where the girl was
\v 41 and taking her hand, he said, “Young woman, I tell you: get up!”
\v 42 Immediately she got up and walked around. And everyone marvelled at the amazing thing that had happened. (She was twelve years old.)
\v 43 Jesus repeatedly told them to keep this to themselves, and added that they should give her something to eat.
\c 6
\s1 Jesus’ community can’t believe he’s from God
\r (Mat. 13:53-58; Luk. 4:16-30)
\p
\v 1 So Jesus left there and went back with his followers to his hometown.
\v 2 It was now the Rest Day and when he started teaching in the meeting hall, many who heard him were astonished, saying, “Where did he learn all this? How could he have such wisdom and be able to do these miracles?
\v 3 Isn’t this the carpenter, the son of Mary, and the brother of James and Joseph and Judas and Simon? Don’t his sisters live around here?” And they were offended by his teaching.
\p
\v 4 \x + \xo 6:4: \xt Jn 4:44.\x*Jesus told them, “A prophet is only dishonouring in his own home town, and among his own relatives, and in his own home.”
\p
\v 5 And he wasn’t able to do even one miracle there, except for placing his hands on a few sick people and healing them.
\v 6 He was amazed at how they wouldn’t believe him as he went around the villages teaching.
\s1 Jesus sends his apprentices out in pairs
\r (Mat. 10:5-15; Luk. 9:1-6)
\p
\v 7 Then he called his twelve apprentices and started sending them out in pairs and giving them authority over demons.
\v 8 He insisted that they can carry a walking stick but not to take food, a backpack, or money.
\v 9 They could wear one pair of sandals, but not take changes of clothes.
\v 10 And he told them, “Whenever you are invited into a home, stay at that one place until you leave that town.
\v 11 \x + \xo 6:11: \xt Acts 13:51.\x*But if any places don’t want you or don’t want to hear what you have to say, just leave that place. As you go, shake the dust off your sandals so they can see \add that you pass the responsibility of what happened to them\add*.
\p
\v 12 So the apprentices went off and started telling people to repent.
\v 13 \x + \xo 6:13: \xt Jam 5:14.\x*And they drove out many demons, and anointed many sick people with olive oil and healed them.
\s1 The execution of John the Immerser
\r (Mat. 14:1-12; Luk. 9:7-9)
\p
\v 14 \x + \xo 6:14-15: \xt Mat 16:14; Mrk 8:28; Luk 9:19.\x*Jesus was now becoming well known and King Herod \add Antipas\add* heard about him. He thought that maybe John the Immerser had come back to life and that’s why he was able to do miracles.
\p
\v 15 But others thought it was \add the promised return of\add* Elijah, and yet others thought he must be another prophet like the ones \add in the Scriptures\add*.
\p
\v 16 But hearing about Jesus, Herod was telling people, “That John who I had beheaded, he must have come back to life!”
\v 17 \x + \xo 6:17-18: \xt Luk 3:19-20.\x*Because Herod himself had had John arrested and put in prison because he had married Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife.
\v 18 John had been telling him that it was wrong for him to marry his brother’s wife,
\v 19 and so Herodias resented him enough to want to kill him, but Herod hadn’t be able to
\v 20 because he respected John as a righteous and holy teacher and so he kept him alive. He often enjoyed hearing from John and thought a lot about what he said.
\p
\v 21 However, an opportunity came at Herod’s birthday celebration, when he threw a feast for his top officials and generals and for the leaders in Galilee.
\v 22 The daughter of Herodias came in and danced for them, and the king and his party guests all enjoyed it. So the king said to the young woman, “Just ask me for anything and I’ll give it to you.”
\v 23 And he made an oath, “Even if you asked for half of my kingdom, I’d give it to you!”
\p
\v 24 So she went out and asked her mother what she should ask for. Her mother told her that she should ask for John’s head.
\p
\v 25 So going back into the party, she said seriously to the king, “I would like the head of John the Immerser on a plate!”
\p
\v 26 The king was really upset with that, but because he had made loud oaths in front of all his guests, he couldn’t say no.
\v 27 So he ordered an executioner to go out and return with John’s head. He went off and beheaded him in the prison
\v 28 and brought the head into the party on a plate and gave it to the girl, and she gave it to her mother.
\v 29 When John’s followers heard about this, they came and fetched his body and put it into a tomb.
\s1 Jesus feeds 5,000 people
\r (Mat. 14:13-21; Luk. 9:10-17; Jn 6:1-14)
\p
\v 30 Now the apprentices who had been sent out returned back to Jesus and they reported back everything they had done and what they had been teaching \add people\add*.
\v 31 Then he told them, “Let’s just all of us head for a quiet place and take a break.” This was because there were so many people always coming and going, and sometimes they didn’t even have a chance to eat.
\v 32 So they went by boat away to a quiet place by themselves.
\p
\v 33 But people from towns all around had seen them going and recognised who they were, so they ran around the lake on foot and got there ahead of them.
\v 34 \x + \xo 6:34: \xt Num 27:17; 1Ki 22:17; 2Ch 18:16; Eze 34:5; Mat 9:36.\x*So when Jesus got out of the boat, he saw a big crowd and felt sorry for them because they seemed like sheep without a shepherd, so he started teaching them many things.
\v 35 Then, when it was already getting late, his apprentices came up and said, “This place is pretty isolated and it’s already late.
\v 36 Send these people off now so they can go to the nearby settlements and villages and buy themselves something to eat.”
\p
\v 37 But Jesus answered them, “You give them something to eat.”
\p They complained, “If we go, should we buy several months wages worth of bread so we can give all of them something to eat?”
\p
\v 38 But he asked, “Go and find out how much bread you have.”
\p When they’d found out they said, “Five buns and two fish.”
\p
\v 39 Jesus told all the people to line up in rows and sit down on the green grass.
\v 40 So they sat down in rows of fifty to a hundred.
\v 41 Then holding the five buns and two fish, he looking up to the sky and blessed \add God\add*, and then broke up the buns and gave pieces to his apprentices so they could do likewise to the people, and he also divided up the two fish,
\v 42 and all the people ate and were satisfied.
\v 43 Then they collected the left-over pieces of bread, filling twelve baskets, as well as the left-over pieces of fish.
\v 44 And the headcount of men who ate that evening was five thousand.
\s1 Jesus walks on the lake surface
\r (Mat. 14:22-33; Jn 6:15-21)
\p
\v 45 Straight after that, Jesus sent his apprentices off in the boat to go across to Bethsaida while he sent the crowd home.
\v 46 Then he said goodbye to everyone, and climbed the hill to pray.
\v 47 Later in the night, the boat was out in the middle of the lake, and only Jesus remained back there on the land.
\v 48 He saw them struggling to row against the wind, and sometime after 3am he came out to them, walking on the lake surface as if to walk past them.
\v 49 But they had seen someone walking on the lake and thought it was a ghost, and they yelled out
\v 50 because they had all seen it and were terrified.
\p But Jesus immediately spoke to them and said, “Hey, take heart, it’s me, don’t be afraid!”
\v 51 Then he climbed up into the boat and the wind died down. And they were all totally astounded
\v 52 because they hadn’t understood the implications of him feeding all the people because their minds were closed.
\s1 Jesus heals many people around Gennesaret
\r (Mat. 14:34-36)
\p
\v 53 After completing their crossing, they anchored at Gennesaret.
\v 54 And when they got out of the boat, again people recognised Jesus
\v 55 and ran around that region, so next minute people began bringing all of those who were sick, carrying them on pallets to wherever they heard that Jesus was.
\v 56 And whenever Jesus entered villages or cities or fields or marketplaces, they laid the sick down there and were imploring him that they might even just touch the edge of his robe, and anyone who did so was healed.
\c 7
\s1 Jesus suggests obeying God, not tradition
\r (Mat. 15:1-9)
\p
\v 1 Some from the sect of the Pharisees and some of the teachers of the law had come from Jerusalem to observe Jesus
\v 2 and noticed that some of his followers were eating their food without following their religious customs, i.e., without washing their hands.
\v 3 (The Pharisees and, in fact, all the Jewish religious leaders do not eat without first ceremonially washing their hands as taught by their elders over the generations.
\v 4 They won’t eat at the market if they can’t do this first, and have many other regulations about ceremonial washing of cups and jugs and copper kettles.)
\p
\v 5 And the Pharisees and religious teachers asked Jesus, “How come your followers don’t follow our Jewish traditions, but eat without the ceremonial washing of hands?”
\p
\v 6 \x + \xo 7:6-7: \xt Isa 29:13 (LXX).\x*And he answered, “Isaiah got it exactly right when he expressed God’s thoughts about you hypocrites and wrote:
\q1 ‘These people honour me with their lips,
\q2 but their real desires are far away from mine.
\q1
\v 7 Their worship of me is worthless,
\q2 teaching man-made rules as if they are from God.’
\p
\v 8 You’ve ignored God’s commands instead accepting human traditions.
\p
\v 9 And Jesus continued, “You all simply dismiss God’s commands in favour of your own customs.
\v 10 \x + \xo 7:10: a \xt Exo 20:12; Deu 5:16; \xo b \xt Exo 21:17; Lev 20:9.\x*Moses teaches us,
\q1 ‘Honour your parents,’
\p and
\q1 ‘Anyone dishonestly slandering their parents deserves the death penalty.’
\m
\v 11 But when you all encourage people to say, ‘Whatever I had that may have helped you guys has been given to God’,
\v 12 you are actively discouraging them from helping their parents—
\v 13 overriding God’s voice for your very convenient teaching that you disseminate instead. And that’s not the only example!”
\s1 Evil comes from inside a person
\r (Mat. 15:10-20)
\p
\v 14 Jesus called out to the crowd, “Everyone listen to me carefully:
\v 15 Nothing that enters your mouth makes you guilty in God’s eyes. It’s what comes \em out\em* of you that demonstrates your culpability.”
\p
\v 16 ≈
\v 17 When Jesus came back inside, his apprentices asked him what he meant.
\v 18 But he scolded them, “Can’t you understand something so simple! Can’t you see that anything from the outside that enters your body doesn’t make you guilty in God’s sight,
\v 19 because it doesn’t enter your mind but merely goes into your stomach and ends up in the toilet.” (By saying this he clearly showed that is was ok for Jews to eat any food.)
\p
\v 20 He continued, “It’s what comes out of you that makes you guilty in God’s eyes.
\v 21-22 That’s because evil thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery, greed, wickedness, deceit, arrogance, lust, slander, pride, and foolishness all come from \em inside\em* people’s hearts \add and minds\add*.
\v 23 So it’s the evil that’s inside a person and comes out that makes them guilty in God’s eyes.”
\s1 The bold faith of a non-Jewish woman
\r (Mat. 15:21-28)
\p
\v 24 Jesus left that place and went \add up north\add* into the regions of Tyre and Sidon. He tried to enter a house without being noticed but didn’t succeed,
\v 25 and straight away a woman who had heard about him turned up. She knelt in front of him because she had a little daughter who was demon-possessed.
\v 26 The woman was Greek from Phoenicia in Syria and she begged Jesus to command the demon to leave her daughter.
\v 27 But he replied, “Let the \add Jewish\add* children be treated first, because it’s not good to take the children’s food and throw it to the dogs.”
\p
\v 28 And she responded, “Yes, master, but the dogs under the table \em do\em* get to eat the little crumbs that the children drop.”
\p
\v 29 And he answered, “Go home now. As a result of how you just spoke, the demon has already left your daughter.”
\p
\v 30 And when she got home, the demon had indeed gone and her little girl was lying quietly on her bed.
\s1 Jesus heals a deaf man who couldn’t speak
\p
\v 31 Jesus left the Tyre region, passed through Sidon, and came down the \add eastern\add* side of the Lake of Galilee to the Decapolis region.
\v 32 The people there brought a man to him who couldn’t hear or speak, and asked Jesus to heal him.
\v 33 So Jesus took the man back away from the crowd, put his fingers in the man’s ears, then he spat and touched the man’s mouth.
\v 34 Looking up to the sky, he sighed and said, “Open up!”
\p
\v 35 Then the man could hear, and his tongue was released and he began to speak properly.
\v 36 The Jesus advised that they shouldn’t tell anyone, but the more he said that, the more they seemed to spread it around.
\v 37 The crowds were totally amazed, saying, “He can do anything—he makes the deaf able to hear, and enables the ones who couldn’t speak.”
\c 8
\s1 Jesus feeds 4,000 people
\r (Mat. 15:32-39)
\p
\v 1 Another time there was a large crowd again with nothing to eat. Jesus called his apprentices and said,
\v 2 “I feel sorry for all these people because they’ve already been with us for three days and don’t have anything to eat.
\v 3 I can’t send them home because they’re too weak to walk, and some have a long way to go.”
\p
\v 4 His apprentices queried, “Where could anyone find enough food out here in the wilderness?”
\p
\v 5 He asked, “How much bread have you all got?”
\p “Seven buns,” they answered.
\p
\v 6 So Jesus instructed the crowd to sit down on the ground. Then he took the seven buns, gave thanks and broke them and gave pieces to his apprentices to then distribute to the crowd.
\v 7 They also had a few small cooked fish, so he blessed them too and got them to distribute them as well.
\v 8 After all the people had eaten and were full, they collected seven basketfulls of leftovers.
\v 9 There were some four thousand people there that day, and Jesus sent them home after they’d eaten.
\v 10 And he and his apprentices climbed into the boat and headed for the Dalmanutha region.
\s1 The religious leaders want to see a miracle
\r (Mat. 16:1-4)
\p
\v 11 \x + \xo 8:11: \xt Mat 12:38; Luk 11:16.\x*Some men from the sect of the Pharisees came out to Jesus amd started arguing with him. They were checking him out and wanted to see a miracle.
\v 12 \x + \xo 8:12: \xt Mat 12:39; Luk 11:29.\x*Jesus grieved inside and asked, “Why do you people need to see a miracle before you’ll believe me? Actually, no miracle will be done for this generation.”
\p
\v 13 So Jesus left in the boat again and crossed to the other side of the lake.
\s1 The apprentices miss the significance of what’s happening
\r (Mat. 16:5-12)
\p
\v 14 But Jesus’ apprentices forgot to take any food other than one bun that someone in the boat had.
\v 15 \x + \xo 8:15: \xt Luk 12:1.\x*He told them, “Watch out for the yeast of the Pharisees and of King Herod.”
\p
\v 16 They asked each other what it meant—was it because they forgot food?
\p
\v 17 But Jesus knew what they were saying and asked, “Why are you all discussing about not having food? Can’t you figure it out? Or are your minds completely closed?
\v 18 \x + \xo 8:18: \xt Jer 5:21; Eze 12:2; Mrk 4:12.\x*You all have eyes but can’t seem to see and have ears but can’t seem to listen. Have you already forgotten what just happened?
\v 19 When I broke up the five buns to feed five thousand people, how many basketfulls of leftovers did you collect?”
\p “Twelve,” they answered.
\p
\v 20 “And when we fed four thousand with seven buns, how many full baskets of leftovers then?”
\p “Seven,” they answered.
\p
\v 21 Jesus asked, “How can you all not understand what’s going on right in front of you!”
\s1 Jesus heals a blind man near Bethsaida
\p
\v 22 As they entered Bethsaida, the people brought a blind man to Jesus and asked him to touch him.
\v 23 So Jesus took the man’s hand and led him out of the village. Then he spat in his eyes, placed his hands on him, and asked him, “What can you see?”
\p
\v 24 The man looked around and answered, “I can see the people, but they just look like trees.”
\v 25 Jesus touched the man’s eyes again and then he could see clearly—he was now completely better.
\v 26 Then Jesus told him not to go back into the village but to go straight home.
\s1 Jesus asks who they think he is
\r (Mat. 16:13-20; Luk. 9:18-21)
\p
\v 27 Then Jesus and his followers moved around the various villages of Caesaria Philippi. On the way, he asked them, “Who does everyone think I am?”
\p
\v 28 \x + \xo 8:28: \xt Mrk 6:14-15; Luk 9:7-8.\x*They said, “Some say John the Immerser, some say Elijah, and some say one of the prophets.”
\p
\v 29 \x + \xo 8:29: \xt Jn 6:68-69.\x*Then he asked, “And what do you all think?”
\p Peter said, “You are the promised one sent by God.”
\p
\v 30 Then Jesus warned them not to tell others about him.
\s1 Jesus’ radical challenge to his would-be followers
\r (Mat. 16:21-28; Luk. 9:22-27)
\p
\v 31 Then Jesus began teaching his followers that the Son of Man would need to suffer a lot, to be rejected by the religious leaders, and so to be put to death but to come back to life after three days.
\v 32 He taught this very clearly, but Peter took him aside and told him off.
\v 33 Jesus turned back and looked at the others, then reprimanded Peter, “Stand back, Satan! You’re applying human values instead of considering God’s plan.”
\p
\v 34 \x + \xo 8:34: \xt Mat 10:38; Luk 14:27.\x*Calling out to them and to the crowd, he said, “Anyone who wants to follow me must first put aside their own desires and then follow me—even through very difficult times.
\v 35 \x + \xo 8:35: \xt Mat 10:39; Luk 17:33; Jn 12:25.\x*Anyone who worries about saving their own life will lose it, but whoever gives their life due to following me and my teaching will save their life.
\v 36 Because it doesn’t benefit a person if they gain everything in the world but lose their soul.
\v 37 What can someone offer in order to buy a home for their soul?
\v 38 Yes, whoever is ashamed of me and my message in front of this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man will likewise be ashamed of them when he comes clearly displaying God’s greatness and bringing the holy angels.”
\c 9
\p
\v 1 And he continued, “I can assure you that some of the ones standing here won’t die until they have seen the powerful Kingdom of God arrive.”
\s1 Moses and Elijah speak with Jesus
\r (Mat. 17:1-13; Luk. 9:28-36)
\p
\v 2 \x + \xo 9:2-7: \xt 2Pe 1:17-18.\x*Six days later Jesus took Peter and James and John, and just the four of them went up onto a high hill. Then he was changed right in front of their eyes
\v 3 and his clothes turned incredibly shining white—whiter than any bleach could make them.
\v 4 And Elijah and Moses appeared beside Jesus and started talking with him.
\v 5 Peter said to Jesus, “Teacher, it’s good that we’re here. Maybe we could make three shelters up here: one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah?”
\v 6 He said that because they were terrified and didn’t know what to say.
\p
\v 7 \x + \xo 9:7: \xt Mat 3:17; Mrk 1:11; Luk 3:22.\x*Then a cloud came over the sun and a voice came out of the cloud saying, “This is my dear son. Listen to him.”
\v 8 When they looked around, they couldn’t see anyone else there any more, except for Jesus himself.
\p
\v 9 As they descended again, Jesus told them to tell no one what had happened up there until after the Son of Man came back to life.
\p
\v 10 They remembered that, although between all three of them they couldn’t understand the bit about coming back to life.
\v 11 \x + \xo 9:11: \xt Mal 4:5; Mat 11:14.\x*They asked Jesus, “Isn’t it written that Elijah will be the first to return?”
\p
\v 12 He answered, “Yes, Elijah is indeed the one to come first to start the restoration. But isn’t it also written that the Son of Man will suffer a lot and be scorned?
\v 13 You see, Elijah has come already, and they treated him just however they liked, just like it was written that it would happen.”
\s1 Jesus drives out a stubborn demon
\r (Mat. 17:14-21; Luk. 9:37-43a)
\p
\v 14 When they got back to \add his other\add* followers, Jesus saw that they were surrounded by a large crowd and the religious teachers were debating with them.
\v 15 The crowd were very surprised when they noticed Jesus and came running to greet him.
\v 16 He asked them, “What were you all talking about?”
\p
\v 17 One of the people answered, “Teacher, I brought my son here—he has a demon that prevents him from speaking.
\v 18 Whenever it takes hold of him, it attacks him and he starts foaming at the mouth and grating his teeth and his joints lock up. I tried to get your followers to command it to leave but they couldn’t.”
\p
\v 19 Jesus replied, “You are a faithless generation. How much longer will I have to be here? How much longer can I tolerate you all? Bring him here.”
\v 20 So they brought the boy to him. When he saw Jesus, the demon immediately caused him to have convulsions and fall on the ground—rolling over and foaming at the mouth.
\p
\v 21 Jesus asked his father, “How long has this been happening?”
\p “Since he was small,” he replied,
\v 22 “and often it throws him into the fire or into water to try to destroy him. But if you feel sorry for us and can do it, please help us.”
\p
\v 23 Jesus asked him, “If I can? A person who believes can do anything.”
\p
\v 24 The boys father cried out, “I do believe—help me to fight unbelief.”
\p
\v 25 Then Jesus noticing that a big crowd was quickly forming, scolded the evil spirit, “You spirit who causes muteness and deafness. Leave this boy now and never return to him.”
\p
\v 26 There was yelling and strong convulsions, and then the demon left him and the boy lay still as if dead, and many people thought he was.
\v 27 But Jesus took his hand and lifted it, and the boy got up.
\p
\v 28 When Jesus and his apprentices had gone into the house by themselves, they asked him, “How come we couldn’t drive it out?”
\p
\v 29 He replied, “This kind will only leave after prayer and fasting.”
\s1 Jesus talks again about being executed
\r (Mat. 17:22-23; Luk. 9:43b-45)
\p
\v 30 Then they left that place and were moving around Galilee, because Jesus didn’t want people to know where he was
\v 31 while he was teaching his apprentices. He told them, “The Son of Man will be arrested and executed, but after three days he’ll come back to life.”
\p
\v 32 But they didn’t know what that meant, and they were too scared to ask him.
\s1 How to be the best
\r (Mat. 18:1-5; Luk. 9:46-48)
\p
\v 33 Then they went Capernaum and when they arrived at the house, Jesus asked them what they were discussing on the way.
\p
\v 34 \x + \xo 9:34: \xt Luk 22:24.\x*But they didn’t reply because while they were walking, they had been talking about which of them is the best.
\v 35 \x + \xo 9:35: \xt Mat 20:26-27; 23:11; Mrk 10:43-44; Luk 22:26.\x*So Jesus sat down and called the twelve of them and explained, “Whoever wants to be at the top, has to be at the bottom and help all the others.”
\v 36 Then Jesus called a young boy and stood him in the middle of them, and giving him a hug said,
\v 37 \x + \xo 9:37: \xt Mat 10:40; Luk 10:16; Jn 13:20.\x*“Whoever welcomes young children on my behalf, welcomes me, and whoever welcomes me is not actually welcoming me, but welcoming the one who sent me here.”
\s1 Others are also serving Jesus
\r (Luk. 9:49-50)
\p
\v 38 John checked with Jesus, “Teacher, we saw someone using your authority to command demons to leave, but we told him off because he wasn’t one of us.”
\p
\v 39 Jesus responded, “No, don’t stop him because anyone who does a miracle using my name won’t just quickly turn around and slander me.
\v 40 \x + \xo 9:40: \xt Mat 12:30; Luk 11:23.\x*Anyone who’s not against us is for us.
\v 41 \x + \xo 9:41: \xt Mat 10:42.\x* Anyone who gives you water to drink because you are followers of God’s chosen one and who does it because they are working for me, I can assure you that they’ll receive their reward.
\s1 Difficult teachings about disobedience

\v 45 And if your foot causes you to disobey God, cut it off—it’s better to enter \add eternal\add* life being maimed, than to have two feet but to be thrown into hell.

\p
\v 1 Then Jesus left there and went down to the Judean area and across the Jordan river. Again the crowds followed him, and he taught them just like he usually did.
\p
\v 2 Some from the Pharisees sect approached Jesus to check him out and asked, “Does the law allow a husband to dismiss his wife?”
\p
\v 3 “Well, what law did Moses give to you all?” he asked.
\p
\v 4 \x + \xo 10:4: \xt Deu 24:1-4; Mat 5:31.\x*They answered, “Moses said that a husband is allowed to write a statement of divorce and dismiss his wife with it.”
\p
\v 5 Jesus responded, “Yes, he wrote that law because he saw your stubborn desires,
\v 6 \x + \xo 10:6: \xt Gen 1:27; 5:2.\x*but God made both men and women right at the beginning.
\v 7 \x + \xo 10:7-8: \xt Gen 2:24.\x*As a result, a man leaves his parents and joins together with his wife
\v 8 and the couple become a single unit. So there's no longer two of them, but only one.
\v 9 So if it's God who joins them together like that, no person \add has the authority\add* to separate them.”
\p
\v 10 Back in the house again, his apprentices asked about this.
\v 11 \x + \xo 10:11-12: \xt Mat 5:32; 1Cor 7:10-11.\x*And Jesus told them, “Whoever divorces his wife and marries another person, commits adultery towards his wife.”
\v 12 And likewise if the wife divorces her husband and marries another person, she is committing adultery towards her husband.”
