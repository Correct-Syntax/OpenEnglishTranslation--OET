# Open English Translation Readers’ Version (OET-RV)

## Introduction

The OET Reader’s Version is manually translated from the OET Literal Version which is a word-for-word translation
of the original Hebrew and Greek where the words have been minimally reordered to make sense in English.

This translation methodolgy is based on the idea that it’s easier to try to focus on creating a draft that’s natural English
and then to fix accuracy and consistency issues later, rather than the opposite.
There are so many Bible translations in the world, including in English, where the grammar and expressions of the translation
are much more like Hebrew or Greek styles than being natural in the language that they’re being translated into.

Currently (July 2023), around 50% of the ‘New Testament’ has been rough drafted.

## TODO list

- Replace "whoever" with anyone
- Do a spell-check
- Consider replacing J with Y, e.g., Jacob -> Yacob, John -> Yohn
- Check consistency of keyterms, e.g., how is ‘son of God’, ‘holy spirit’, ‘kingdom of the heavens’ translated everywhere?
- Compare parallel passages
- Define and check style of s1 section headings
- Define and implement footnote classes
