\s1 Elkanah and family at Shiloh
\rem /s1 Elkanah and His Family; Samuel's birth and childhood; The Birth of Samuel; Samuel's Birth and Dedication; Elkanah and His Family at Shiloh
\p
\v 1 There was a man named Elkanah from Ramatayim-Zofim \add who lived\add* in the Efraimite hill country. (He was an Efraimite—the son of Yeroham, son of Elihu,\x + \xo 1:1 \xt 1 Chr. 6:27,34.\x* son of Tohu, son of Zuf.)
\v 2 He had two wives: Hannah (who had no children) and Peninnah (who had \add several\add* children).
\p
\v 3 \add ≈Every year\add* he would \add take his family\add* to Shiloh to \add ≈offer sacrifices\add* to commander Yahweh. Eli was Yahweh's priest there, and his two sons Hofni and Pinehas \add also served there\add*.
\p
\v 4 on the day that Elkanah made his sacrifice, he would give portions \add of the cooked meat\add* to Peninnah and to all her sons and daughters,
\v 5 \add ≈but\add* he'd give a double portion to Hannah because he loved \add *her\add*, \add even though\add* Yahweh had \add ≈not enabled her to have children\add*.
\v 6 Then her rival would provoke her and \add ≈try to make her angry\add*, because Yahweh hadn't \add ≈given her children\add*.
\v 7 And so it \add ≈happened every year\add*. Every time they went to Yahweh's \add ≈tent\add*, \add @Peninnah\add* ridiculed him, and \add @Hannah\add* would weep and wouldn't eat.
\v 8 Then Elkanah would \add ≈ask\add* her, “Hannah, why are you crying? And why aren't you eating? And why \add ≈are you so upset\add*? Isn't it better \add ≈having me\add* than \add ≈having\add* ten sons?”

\p
\v 9 \add One time\add* Hannah got up after eating and drinking at Shiloh. (Eli the priest was sitting on the seat near the entrance of Yahweh's \add ≈tent\add*.)
\v 10 \add @Hannah\add* \add ≈was very upset\add*, and she prayed to Yahweh and wept uncontrollably.
\v 11 Then she made a vow, saying, “Commander Yahweh, if you \add ≈would only notice the misery\add* of your female servant and remember me. Don't \add ≈ignore\add* \add *me\add*. \add ≈Help\add* your female servant \add ≈to give birth to a son\add*, then I'll give him to \add *you\add* \add ≈for his entire\add* life, and \add ≈he'll never have his hair cut\add*.”\x + \xo 1:11: \xt Num 6:5.\x*
\p
\v 12 As she continued praying to Yahweh, Eli was watching her mouth.
\v 13 \add ≈Now\add* Hannah was \add ≈praying from her heart\add*, and her lips were moving \add ≈but she wasn't speaking aloud\add*. Eli thought \add she must be\add* drunk,
\v 14 and \add ≈scolded\add* her, “You shouldn't be getting drunk. Get rid of your wine.”
\p
\v 15 “No, my master,” Hannah replied, “I'm a woman \add ≈who's suffering deep down\add*. I haven't drunk any wine or intoxicating drink, \add ≈but rather\add* I've been \add ≈sharing my inner issues\add* with Yahweh.
\v 16 Don't think that your female servant is \add just\add* a worthless woman, because just now I was \add ≈praying as a result of my terrible anguish and frustration\add*.”
\p
\v 17 “\add Then\add* go in peace,” Eli replied. “And may Israel's God grant your request that you \add ≈presented to\add* him.”
\p
\v 18 “\add ≈Please assume the best of\add* your female servant,” said \add @Hannah\add*, then she went on her way and \add ≈had something to eat\add*, and \add ≈something had changed in her demeanor\add*.

\v 19 They \add all\add* gut up early the \add next\add* morning and worshiped Yahweh \add again\add*, then they returned to their home at Ramah. Then Elkanah \add ≈slept with\add* his wife Hannah, and Yahweh \add ≈answered her prayer\add*.
\v 20 \add @Hannah\add* got pregnant, and in due course, she gave birth to a son. She named him ‘Shemu'el’ \add (meaning ‘heard by God’, usually changed to ‘Samuel’ in English)\add* because she had requested him from Yahweh.
\rem /s1 Hannah Dedicates Samuel
\p
\v 21 \add At the usual time,\add* Elkanah and all his household went \add to Shiloh\add* to \add ≈offer their sacrifices and fulfill their vows\add* to Yahweh.
\v 22 \add ≈But\add* Hannah \add ≈didn't accompany them\add* because she'd told her husband, “I'll \add come and\add* bring him when he's weaned. Then he can be \add ≈taken in to\add* Yahweh and \add ≈permanently\add* remain there.”
\v 23 “Do \add ≈what you think's best\add*,” her husband \add ≈replied\add*. “Stay until you've weaned him. May Yahweh \add ≈do whatever he said\add* \add to you\add*.” \add ≈So\add* \add *she\add* stayed \add behind\add* and breastfed her son until she \add ≈eventually\add* weaned him.
\p
\v 24 \add The next year,\add* after she'd weaned him, she took the young boy with \add #them\add*, along with three bulls, a \add ≈sack\add* of flour, and a \add ≈container\add* of wine. Then she brought him to Yahweh's \add ≈tent\add* in Shiloh,
\v 25 and after slaughtering the bull, they took the boy in to Eli.
\v 26 “Please, my master,” \add @Hannah\add* said. “As your spirit lives, my master, I'm the woman who was standing with you here to pray to Yahweh.
\v 27 I prayed \add ≈that Yahweh would give me a son, and he did, and this is him\add*.
\v 28 Also, I dedicated him to Yahweh all his life, so he's now given to Yahweh.”

\q1 ≈He humbles, and he also honours.
\q1
\v 8 He lifts the poor up from the dust,
\q1 ≈and lifts up the needy from the ash heap
\q1 so they can sit with influential \add people\add*
\q1 ≈and be given the seat of honour.
\q1 The earth's foundations belong to Yahweh—

\p
\v 12 \add ≈Now\add* Eli's sons were \add ≈worthless scoundrels\add* who didn't obey Yahweh.
\v 13 It was the custom of those priests that when anyone was offering a sacrifice and as soon as the meat was boiling, the priest's servant would come along holding a three-pronged fork
\v 14 and stick it into the pot or pan. The priest would then \add ≈claim\add* whatever the fork brought up. That's what they did to all the Israelis who came to Shiloh \add to offer sacrifices\add*.
\v 15 Also, before the fat \add was removed to\add* burn, the priest's servant would say to the person sacrificing, “Give some meat to the priest—he doesn't want just boiled meat \add all the time\add*—he'll take some raw meat \add as well\add* to roast.”
\p
\v 16 But if the person tried to say, “Once the fat has all be burnt, then take whatever you want for yourself,” then he'd \add ≈assert\add*, “No, you'd better give it \add right\add* now or I'll take it by force.”
\v 17 And \add so\add* the actions of those young men was very wicked in Yahweh's mind because they \add just\add* treated sacrifices to Yahweh with contempt.

\v 20 Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife and say, “May Yahweh \add ≈give more children for you through\add* this woman in place of the \add boy\add* \add ≈dedicated\add* to Yahweh.” Then they'd return home.

\v 27 \add ≈One day\add* one of God's \add prophets\add* came to Eli and told him, “This is what Yahweh says, ‘Did\add n't\add* I clearly reveal myself to your ancestors when they were Far'oh's \add ≈slaves\add* in Egypt?
\v 28 And out of all the Israeli tribes, I chose \add @your ancestor\add* to be a priest to me, to go up on my altar, to burn incense, \add and\add* to \add ≈wear the sacred apron in front of me\add*.

\p
\v 30 “Therefore, this is what Yahweh the God of Israel declares: ‘I indeed said \add ≈your ancestors and then your descendants\add* would \add ≈serve me forever\add*.’ But now \add ≈I declare this\add* \add instead\add*: ‘\add ≈This cannot continue\add* because I will honour those who honour me, but those who despise me will be \add ≈side-lined\add*.
\v 31 Listen, the time is coming when I'll \add ≈bring you and your relatives to an end—none of your men will die of old age\add*

\v 2 \add ≈By that time,\add* Eli's \add ≈sight was very poor\add*—he could barely see. \add One night when\add* he was sleeping in his place,\f + \fr 3:2 \ft Some translations use ‘room’ here instead of ‘place’, but it could easily be that he had a small bed in a corner somewhere.\f*
\v 3 and Shemuel was lying down in Yahweh's tent (where the box was that contained the \add ≈stone slabs\add*), \add ≈but\add* God's lamp was still burning.
\v 4 Yahweh called out to Shemuel, and he \add ≈called back\add*, “I'm here. \add Coming.\add*”
\v 5 Then he ran to Eli and said, “Here I am, because you called me.”
\p “I didn't call,” he said. “Go back \add and\add* lie down.” \add ≈So\add* he went \add back\add* and laid down.
\p
\v 6 Yahweh called again, “Shemuel.”
\p Shemuel got up and went to Eli and said, “Here I am, because you called me.”
\p “I didn't call, my son,” he said, “Go back \add and\add* lie down.”
\p
\v 7 (\add At this point\add*, Shemuel didn't \add really\add* know Yahweh, because Yahweh hadn't revealed \add himself\add* to him before.)
\v 8 Then Yahweh called Shemuel a third time. He got up and went to Eli and said, “Here I am, because you called me.”
\p Then Eli realised that it was Yahweh who was calling the boy
\v 9 and he told Shemuel, “Go \add and\add* lie down. Then if he calls to you \add again\add*, \add ≈just answer\add*, ‘Speak, Yahweh, because your servant is listening.’ ” \add ≈So\add* Shemuel went and laid down \add again\add* in his place.
\p
\v 10 Then Yahweh came and \add ≈stood nearby\add* and called \add ≈like he'd done the other\add* times, “Shemuel, Shemuel.”
\p “Speak,” Shemuel said, “because your servant is listening.”
\p
\v 11 “Listen,” Yahweh told \add *him\add*, “I'm about to do something in Israel that \add ≈will make everyone's ears tingle when they hear it\add*.
\v 12 \add ≈When it happens\add*, I'll \add ≈do everything that I've said about Eli and his family\add*, from the beginning to the end.
\v 13 I've told him \add already\add* that I'm about to \add ≈eternally\add* judge his \add ≈household\add* because \add ≈he knew about the evil that was being done\add*, because his sons were \add ≈bringing curses on\add* themselves and he didn't scold them.

\p \add At that time,\add* Israel went to war against the Philistines. They camped at Eben-Ezer and the Philistines camped at Afek.
\v 2 Then the Philistines lined up to meet Israel and the battle spread. Israel was defeated by the Philistines and they killed about 4,000 warriors in the battle line in the field.
\v 3 \add ≈As\add* the people\f + \fr 4:3 \ft It seems that most translations assume that this is referring to the remainder of the warriors staggering back into the camp (which is certainly a possibility), but we've interpreted it as the people coming together (with their elders as it says), to try to figure out why they were defeated. (Similarly for v4.)\f* came into the camp, the \add ≈Israeli\add* elders \add ≈asked\add* \add themselves\add*, “Why did Yahweh \add ≈allow the Philistines to slaughter\add* us today?

\p
\v 5 \add ≈As\add* the box with Yahweh's agreement \add ≈was carried\add* into the camp, all the \add ≈Israelis\add* shouted so loud that the ground shook.
\v 6 When the Philistines heard the \add ≈noise\add*, they said, “What's that loud shout in the Hebrews' camp?” Then they realised that the box \add ≈with Yahweh's covenant\add* had come into their camp
\v 7 and they were afraid saying, “A god has come into the \add Israeli\add* camp.” Then they said, “\add ≈This means trouble\add*, because it wasn't like this yesterday \add ≈or the previous days\add*.
\v 8 \add ≈Oh dear\add*! Who will rescue us from these mighty gods? Those are the gods who struck the Egyptians with every plague in the wilderness.

\v 5 (\add ≈Because of that\add*, until this day Dagon's priests and everyone who enters Dagon's temple in Ashdod won't tread on the threshhold.)
\s1 God punishes the Philistine cities
\p
\v 6 Yahweh \add ≈caused a lot of trouble\add* for the \add people of\add* Ashdod and he terrifed them. He \add ≈caused\add* them and \add ≈the people in the region\add* to \add ≈get lumpy growths on their skin\add*.
\v 7 \add ≈When\add* the \add ≈leaders\add* in Ashdod \add ≈saw what was happening\add*, they said, “The God of Israel's box mustn't stay with us because \add ≈he's punishing\add* \add both\add* us and our god Dagon.”
\v 8 \add ≈So\add* they sent for all the Philistine rulers, and \add when they'd assembled\add* they \add ≈asked\add*, “What should we do with the God of Israel's box?”
\p “Let the the God of Israel's box be taken around to Gat,” they \add ≈decided\add*. \add ≈So\add* they moved \add *it\add* \add there\add*.
\v 9 After \add ≈it arrived\add*, Yahweh \add ≈started punishing Gat\add* and \add both\add* young and old men in the city started getting growths on their skin, and it caused a huge panic.
\v 10 \add ≈So\add* they sent God's box to Ekron, \add ≈but\add* as soon as \add *it\add* entered \add *the city\add*, the Ekronites cried out, “\add Hey!\add* They've brought the God of Israel's box here to \add ≈kill us\add* and our people.”
\v 11 \add ≈So\add* they sent for the Philistine rulers, and \add ≈when they'd assembled\add* they said, “Send the God of Israel's box away. \add ≈Send it back\add* to its place \add ≈so\add* it won't \add ≈cause us and our people to die\add*.” Because there was a \add ≈deadly panic all over\add* the city \add as\add* \add ≈God's punishment there was severe\add*
\v 12 and the men who didn't die suffered with the growths. \add ≈So\add* the \add ≈people's\add* cry went up to the heavens.

\s1 Sending the chest back to Israel
\rem /s1 The Return of the Covenant Box; The Ark Returned to Israel; The Philistines Return the Ark
\p
\v 1 \add ≈So it was that\add* Yahweh's box was \add held\add* in Philistine territory for seven months,
\v 2 then the Philistines called \add &their\add* priests and diviners and \add ≈asked\add*, “What should we do with Yahweh's box? \add ≈Show us how we can get it back\add* away to its place.”
\p
\v 3 “If you're going to send the God of Israel's box back,” they \add ≈responded\add*, “don't send it \add ≈back by itself\add*, but definitely return it to him with a guilt offering. Then you'll all be healed, and you'll all \add ≈understand why you've been suffering\add*.”
\p
\v 4 “What guilt offering should we \add ≈send with it\add*?” they \add ≈asked\add*.
\p “Five gold \add replicas of the\add* tumours, and five gold mice,” they said. “That's the number of \add *our\add* rulers, because \add ≈the same\add* plague \add ≈affected both them and the people\add*.
\v 5 Make replicas of the tumours and replicas of the mice that have been destroying the land, and it will honour Israel's God. Then perhaps he will \add ≈less his punishment that's been\add* on you and on your gods and on your land.
\v 6 Why \add ≈have you all been so stubborn\add* just like the Egyptians when Pharaoh made \add ≈them stubborn\add*? When \add @Israel's God\add* dealt severely with them, didn't \add @the Egyptians\add* send \add @the Israelis\add* away and they went?
\v 7 \add ≈So\add* now, \add ≈get a brand\add* new cart with two nursing cows \add ≈which have never had a yoke on their necks\add*. Hitch the cows to the cart \add ≈but\add* take their calves \add ≈back to their pen\add*.
\v 8 Then pick up Yahweh's box and put it into the cart \add ≈along with\add* the gold objects that you are \add ≈sending with it\add* as a guilt offering \add ≈put in another container beside the box\add*. \add ≈Finally\add*, send \add @the cart\add* away and \add off\add* it will go.
\v 9 Then watch \add <it\add*. If it \add ≈heads towards\add* Beyt-Shemesh \add ≈in Israeli territory, then it's their god that caused this terrible calamity\add*. \add ≈But\add* if not, then we'll know that \add ≈it wasn't the Israeli god, and that\add* it \add all\add* happened to us by chance.”
\p
\v 10 \add ≈So they followed those instructions\add*: they took two cows \add ≈that had been feeding calves\add* and hitched them to the \add new\add* cart, but they shut their calves away in the \add ≈stall\add*.
\v 11 Then they put Yahweh's box into the cart with the \add other\add* container with the gold mice and the replicas of their tumors.
\v 12 \add Amazingly,\add* the cows went straight down the road going to Beyt-Shemesh. They \add ≈stayed on that\add* one highway, walking and mooing, and they \add ≈never once deviated to the left or the right\add*, and the Philistine rulers followed them as far as the border of Beyt-Shemesh.
\p
\v 13 \add ≈Meanwhile in\add* Beyt-Shemesh, \add the people\add* were harvesting wheat in the valley, and when they \add ≈looked up\add* and saw the box, \add ≈they were very happy\add*.
\v 14 The cart came into the field of Yehoshua and \add then the cows just\add* stood there. There was a large stone there, and \add @the people\add* split \add the sides of\add* the wooden cart \add into pieces to start a fire\add*, then offered the cows as a burnt sacrifice to Yahweh.
\v 15 Then the Levites lifted down Yahweh's box and the \add other\add* container that was with it with the gold objects in it, and they placed them on the large stone. Then the men of Beyt-Shemesh offered up \add more\add* burnt offerings and sacrificed sacrifices to Yahweh on that day.
\v 16 The five Philistine rulers watched \add all this from a distance before\add* returning to Ekron that same day.
\s1 The gold replicas
\p
\v 17 The gold \add replicas\add* of tumours that the Philistines sent back as a guilt offering to Yahweh were for \add the five cities\add*: Ashdod, Gaza, Ashkelon, Gat, and Ekron.
\v 18 And the gold mice were from the number of all the Philistine cities \add ≈under\add* the five rulers, including fortified cities as \add ≈well\add* as the villages in the open country, and as far as the large stone that they sat Yahweh's box on. (It's \add still\add* in Yehoshua's field in Beyt-Shemesh until this day.)
\rem /s1 The Ark Moved to Kiriath-Jearim; The Ark at Kiriath-jearim

\v 19 \add ≈But\add* some Beyt-Shemesh men looked into Yahweh's box, and he killed seventy\f + \fr 6:19 \ft TC: The oldest Hebrew text has 50,070 men being killed here, making it hard to imagine how that many men kept clambering over dead bodies to look into the sacred chest.

\v 20 The Beyt-Shemesh men said, “Who can stand in front of the face of Yahweh, this holy God? And \add ≈where should we send the box to from here\add*?”
\v 21 \add ≈So\add* they sent messengers to those living in Kiriat-Yearim, saying, “The Philistines have returned Yahweh's box. Come \add ≈over here and get it\add*.”
