\p
\v 1 There was a man¦125380 named Elkanah from Ramatayim¦125384-Zofim \add who lived\add* in the Efraimite hill country. (He was an Efraimite—the son of Yeroham, son of Elihu,\x + \xo 1:1 \xt 1 Chr. 6:27,34.\x* son of Tohu, son of Zuf.)
\v 2 He had two wives¦125406: Hannah (who had no children) and Peninnah (who had \add several\add* children).
\p
\v 3 \add ≈Every year\add* he would¦125420 \add take his family\add* to Shiloh¦125431 to \add ≈offer sacrifices¦125428\add* to commander Yahweh. Eli was Yahweh's priest¦125439 there, and his two¦125433 sons¦125434 Hofni and Pinehas¦125438 \add also served there\add*.
\p
\v 4 on the day¦125443 that Elkanah made his sacrifice¦125444, he would give portions¦125453 \add of the cooked meat\add* to Peninnah and to all her sons and daughters¦125452,
\v 5 \add ≈but\add* he'd give a double¦125459 portion¦125457 to Hannah because he loved¦125464 \add *her\add*, \add even though\add* Yahweh had \add ≈not enabled her to have children\add*.
\v 6 Then¦125469 her rival¦125470 would provoke¦125469 her and \add ≈try to make her angry\add*, because Yahweh¦125479 hadn't \add ≈given her children\add*.
\v 7 And so it \add ≈happened every year\add*. Every time they went to Yahweh's \add ≈tent\add*, \add @Peninnah\add* ridiculed him, and \add @Hannah\add* would weep and wouldn't eat.
\v 8 Then¦125497 Elkanah would \add ≈ask\add* her, “Hannah, why are you crying? And why aren't you eating¦125506? And why \add ≈are you so upset\add*? Isn't it better \add ≈having me\add* than \add ≈having\add* ten¦125514 sons¦125515?”

\v 9 \add One time\add* Hannah got up after eating and drinking at Shiloh¦125521. (Eli the priest¦125525 was sitting¦125526 on the seat¦125529 near the entrance of Yahweh's \add ≈tent\add*.)
\v 10 \add @Hannah\add* \add ≈was very upset\add*, and she prayed¦125539 to Yahweh¦125542 and wept uncontrollably.
\v 11 Then¦125546 she made a vow, saying, “Commander Yahweh, if you \add ≈would only notice the misery\add* of your female servant and remember¦125558 me. Don't \add ≈ignore\add* \add *me\add*. \add ≈Help\add* your female servant \add ≈to give birth to a son\add*, then I'll give him to \add *you\add* \add ≈for his entire¦125571\add* life¦125574, and \add ≈he'll never have his hair cut\add*.”\x + \xo 1:11: \xt Num 6:5.\x*
\p
\v 12 As she¦125585 continued praying to Yahweh, Eli was watching¦125590 her mouth¦125593.
\v 13 \add ≈Now\add* Hannah was \add ≈praying from her heart¦125600\add*, and her lips¦125602 were moving \add ≈but she wasn't speaking¦125597 aloud\add*. Eli thought \add she must be\add* drunk¦125609,
\v 14 and \add ≈scolded\add* her, “You shouldn't be getting drunk¦125617. Get rid of your¦125621 wine.”
\p
\v 15 “No, my master¦125628,” Hannah replied¦125624, “I'm a woman¦125629 \add ≈who's suffering deep down\add*. I haven't drunk¦125637 any wine or intoxicating drink¦125635, \add ≈but rather\add* I've been \add ≈sharing my inner issues\add* with Yahweh¦125628.
\v 16 Don't think that your¦125650 female servant¦125650 is \add just\add* a worthless¦125654 woman, because just now I was \add ≈praying as a result of my terrible anguish¦125658 and¦125659 frustration\add*.”
\p
\v 17 “\add Then¦125665\add* go¦125668 in peace¦125669,” Eli replied. “And may Israel's God¦125670 grant¦125672 your¦125675 request that you¦125677 \add ≈presented to\add* him¦125678.”
\p
\v 18 “\add ≈Please assume the best of\add* your female servant¦125682,” said¦125680 \add @Hannah\add*, then she¦125681 went¦125685 on her way¦125687 and \add ≈had something to eat\add*, and \add ≈something had changed in her demeanor\add*.

\v 20 \add @Hannah\add* got pregnant¦125720, and in due course, she gave¦125722 birth¦125722 to a son. She named him ‘Shemu'el’ \add (meaning ‘heard by God’, usually changed to ‘Samuel’ in English)\add* because she had requested him from Yahweh.

\v 14 and stick it into the pot or pan. The priest¦126082 would then \add ≈claim\add* whatever the fork brought¦126079 up. That's what they did to all the Israelis who came to Shiloh¦126091 \add to offer sacrifices\add*.

\p \add At that time,\add* Israel went to war against the Philistines. They camped at Eben-Ezer and the Philistines camped at Afek.
\v 2 Then¦126969 the Philistines lined up to meet Israel and the battle spread¦126973. Israel was defeated¦126975 by the Philistines and they killed¦126979 about¦126982 4,000 warriors in the battle line in the countryside¦126981.
\v 3 \add ≈As\add* the people\f + \fr 4:3 \ft It seems that most translations assume that this is referring to the remainder of the warriors staggering back into the camp (which is certainly a possibility), but we've interpreted it as the people coming together (with their elders as it says), to try to figure out why they were defeated. (Similarly for v4.)\f* came¦126986 into the camp, the \add ≈Israeli\add* elders \add ≈asked\add* \add themselves\add*, “Why did Yahweh \add ≈allow the Philistines¦126999 to slaughter\add* us today? Let's get the box¦127005 from Shiloh¦127002 that contains \add the stone slabs with\add* Yahweh's agreement \add on them\add*. \add ≈Once it's amongst us\add*, \add surely\add* it'll save¦127010 us from \add ≈defeat¦126995 by\add* our¦127012 enemies¦127012.”
\v 4 \add ≈So¦127014\add* the people¦127015 sent¦127014 \add <men\add* to Shiloh¦127016 and from there they lifted the box containing Yahweh's agreement \add and the sacred platform\add* with the winged creatures.\f + \fr 4:4 \ft And with Commander Yahweh sitting on, above, or between them.\f* Eli's two¦127028 sons¦127029, Hofni and Finehas, were there with the box containing God's agreement.\x + \xo 4:4: \xt Exo 25:22.\x*
\p
\v 5 \add ≈As\add* the box¦127042 with Yahweh's agreement \add ≈was carried\add* into the camp, all the \add ≈Israelis\add* shouted¦127053 so loud that the ground shook¦127055.
\v 6 When the Philistines¦127059 heard¦127058 the \add ≈noise\add*, they said¦127064, “What's that loud shout in the Hebrews' camp?” Then¦127058 they realised that the box¦127074 \add ≈with Yahweh's covenant\add* had come¦127076 into their camp
\v 7 and they were afraid saying, “A god¦127086 has come¦127085 into the \add Israeli\add* camp.” Then¦127081 they said, “\add ≈This means trouble\add*, because it wasn't like this yesterday¦127097 \add ≈or the previous days¦127098\add*.
\v 8 \add ≈Oh dear\add*! Who will rescue us from these mighty¦127106 gods? Those are the gods who struck¦127111 the Egyptians with every plague¦127117 in the wilderness¦127118.
\v 9 Now we Philistines¦127123 \add ≈really need to fight with passion\add*, because if we don't, we'll ending up serving the Hebrews¦127126 just like they've had to serve¦127125 us. \add ≈Now, gather your courage and fight for your lives\add*.”
\p

\v 8 \add ≈So\add* they sent¦127525 for all the Philistine rulers¦127531, and \add when they'd assembled\add* they \add ≈asked\add*, “What should¦127543 we¦127537 do with the God of Israel's box?”

\p
\v 1 \add ≈So¦127662 it was that\add* Yahweh's box¦127663 was \add held\add* in Philistine territory¦127666 for seven¦127668 months¦127669,
\v 2 then the Philistines¦127672 called¦127671 \add &their\add* priests¦127673 and diviners¦127674 and \add ≈asked\add*, “What should we do with Yahweh's box¦127679? \add ≈Show us how we can get it¦127683 back\add* away to its¦127684 place¦127684.”
\p
\v 3 “If you're going to send the God¦127693 of Israel's box¦127692 back,” they \add ≈responded\add*, “don't¦127695 send it \add ≈back by itself\add*, but definitely return it to him with a guilt¦127705 offering¦127705.

\p
\v 4 “What guilt¦127719 offering¦127719 should we \add ≈send with it\add*?” they \add ≈asked\add*.
\p “Five gold \add replicas of the\add* tumours, and five gold mice,” they said. “That's the number¦127724 of \add *our\add* rulers, because \add ≈the same\add* plague¦127736 \add ≈affected both them and the people\add*.
\v 5 Make replicas of the tumours and replicas of the mice that have been destroying the land, and it will honour¦127754 Israel's God¦127752. Then¦127741 perhaps¦127755 he will \add ≈less his punishment that's been\add* on you and on your gods¦127762 and on your land.
\v 6 Why \add ≈have you¦127767 all been so stubborn\add* just like the Egyptians when Pharaoh made \add ≈them stubborn\add*? When \add @Israel's God\add* dealt¦127780 severely with them, didn't \add @the Egyptians\add* send¦127782 \add @the Israelis\add* away and they¦127772 went?
\v 7 \add ≈So¦127785\add* now, \add ≈get a brand\add* new cart with two nursing¦127793 cows \add ≈which¦127794 have never had a yoke on their necks\add*. Hitch¦127801 the cows to the cart \add ≈but\add* take their calves¦127806 \add ≈back to their pen\add*.
\v 8 Then¦127810 pick up Yahweh's box and put it into the cart \add ≈along with\add* the gold¦127823 objects that you are \add ≈sending with it\add* as a guilt¦127827 offering¦127827 \add ≈put in another container beside the box\add*. \add ≈Finally\add*, send¦127831 \add @the cart\add* away and \add off\add* it will go¦127833.
\v 9 Then¦127835 watch¦127835 \add <it\add*.

\p
\v 10 \add ≈So¦127874 they followed those instructions\add*: they took¦127868 two¦127869 cows \add ≈that had been feeding calves\add* and hitched¦127872 them to the \add new\add* cart, but they shut their¦127876 calves away in the \add ≈stall\add*.

\v 12 \add Amazingly,\add* the cows went straight¦127897 down the road¦127903 going to Beyt-Shemesh.

\v 15 Then the Levites¦127971 lifted down Yahweh's box¦127976 and the \add other\add* container that was with it with the gold¦127989 objects in it, and they placed them on the large¦127994 stone¦127993.

\v 1 As Shemuel grew older, he¦128502 appointed his \add two\add* sons¦128507 as judges¦128508 over Israel.
\v 2 The \add ≈eldest\add* was Yoel and¦128517 \add ≈his brother\add* was Abiyah. They \add ≈were based\add* in Beersheba.

\p
\v 4 \add ≈Eventually,\add* the Israeli elders¦128542 met together¦128540 with Shemuel at Ramah

\v 1 \add ≈Now\add* there was a Benyamite man named Kish (son of Abiel, son of Zeror, son of Bekorath, son of Afiah, the son of a Yaminite man) \add ≈who was strong and wealthy¦128864\add*.
\v 2 \add @Kish\add* had a son \add ≈named\add* Sha'ul who was a handsome¦128873 young¦128872 man and good—\add ≈in fact there¦128874 wasn't any Israeli man\add* better than him, \add and\add* he was \add ≈head and shoulders¦128880 taller than anyone else\add*.
\p
\v 3 \add ≈One time,\add* the female donkeys of Sha'uls father¦128890 Kish \add ≈had gone missing\add*, and Kish \add ≈told\add* his son, “Take one of the servants¦128905 with you, and \add ≈pack up\add* and go and find those donkeys.”
\v 4 \add ≈So¦128913\add* \add #they\add* passed through the Efraimite hill country¦128914, then through the Shalishah¦128920 \add ≈region\add*, but they didn't find them. Then¦128913 they went through the Shaalim \add ≈region\add*, but there was nothing, \add ≈so\add* \add #they\add* \add ≈continued on\add* through the land of the Benyamites, but they didn't find them.
\v 5 \add Finally,\add* they¦128936 entered the Tsuf \add ≈area\add*, and \add eventually\add* Sha'ul said¦128940 to his servant¦128941, “Come on. Let's \add ≈go¦128946 back home in case\add* my father¦128950 \add ≈stops worrying\add* about the donkeys¦128953 and \add starts\add* worrying about us.”
\p
\v 6 \add ≈But¦128957\add* he \add ≈replied\add*, “Listen, please¦128961. There's an honoured¦128968 man of God¦128964 in this city. \add ≈Everything he says comes¦128974 true\add*. Let's go there¦128977 now. Perhaps he'll tell us \add ≈which¦128984 way we should¦128976 have gone\add*.”
\p
\v 7 “\add ≈Ok, then.\add* We can go \add there¦129003\add*,” Sha'ul \add ≈responded\add*, “but what \add ≈can we give\add* the man? \add ≈We don't¦129003 have any more food in our bags, and we never brought along a gift. What else do we have?\add*”
\p
\v 8 “Look,” answered¦129013 the servant¦129012, “I've got a \add ≈small silver¦129023 coin\add*. We can give¦129024 that to the man¦129025 and he'll tell us where to go.”
\v 9 (In Israel before then, \add ≈when people wanted an answer from\add* God¦129042, they'd say, “Come and¦129044 let us go¦129044 to the ‘seer’,” because the prophet¦129049 of today was called¦129051 the ‘seer’ before.)
\p
\v 10 “\add ≈Good idea\add*,” Sha'ul told his servant¦129057. “Let's go¦129062 then.” \add ≈So¦129055\add* they went¦129063 to the city¦129066 there¦129069 where¦129067 the man¦129070 of God¦129071 was.
\v 11 They were \add ≈climbing up the rise towards\add* the city¦129076 \add ≈when\add* they \add ≈met some\add* young¦129079 women¦129079 going¦129074 out to draw water¦129082, and they \add ≈asked\add* them, “Is the seer in \add ≈town\add*?”
\v 12 “\add ≈Yes he is\add*,” they answered¦129089. “Hurry \add ≈though\add*, because he's come¦129100 to the city today \add to offer\add* the sacrifice¦129103 for the people¦129105 at the high¦129106 place¦129106.
\v 13 You'll find him as soon as you enter¦129108 the city¦129109, before¦129113 he goes up to the high place¦129115 to eat. The people¦129121 won't eat until¦129122 he \add ≈gets there\add*, because he himself will bless¦129128 the sacrifice¦129129. Afterwards, \add ≈those who've been invited¦129134\add* will eat \add together there\add*. So go up there now \add ≈and you'll soon find him\add*.”
\v 14 \add ≈So¦129144\add* they went on up into the city, and as they were entering, wow, there was Shemuel¦129151 \add ≈coming out towards¦129153\add* them to go up to the high place¦129155.
\p
\v 15 \add ≈On the previous day¦129164,\add* Yahweh \add ≈had quietly told\add* Shemuel,

He will \add ≈rescue\add* my people from the Philistines¦129191, because I've \add ≈noticed\add* my people because \add ≈I heard their¦129199 cries\add*.”
\p
\v 17 Then¦129202 Shemuel saw¦129203 Sha'ul, and¦129207 Yahweh told him¦129208, “Look, \add that's\add* the man¦129210 that I you¦129213 \add about\add*. \add ≈He\add* will \add help control\add* my people¦129216.”
\v 18 \add ≈As\add* Sha'ul approached¦129218 Shemuel \add ≈right there in the middle¦129223 of the city gateway\add*, he \add ≈asked¦129225\add*, “Please tell me, where's¦129230 the seer's¦129234 house¦129233?”
\p
\v 19 “I am the seer,” Shemuel answered¦129236, “\add Now,\add* Go up to the high¦129246 place¦129246 \add ≈ahead of me\add*, and you'll eat¦129247 with me today. In the morning¦129251, I'll tell you \add ≈what you want to know\add*, then I'll send you off.
\v 20 As for your donkeys¦129258 that were lost three¦129262 days¦129263 ago, don't¦129264 \add ≈worry anymore about them\add* because they've¦129272 been found¦129272. Now, all of Israel is wanting your father's \add ≈household¦129281\add*, and \add ≡wanting\add* you \add in particular\add*.”
\v 21 “\add ≈But\add* I'm a Benyamite,” Sha'ul responded¦129285, “\add That's\add* the smallest¦129293 tribe in Israel, and my clan's the lowliest¦129298 of all the Benyamite clans¦129301. \add ≈So\add* why \add ≈did you¦129305 talk to me like that\add*?”
\p
\v 22 Then Shemuel took¦129311 Sha'ul and his servant¦129318 to the room¦129323 \add where the meal had been prepared\add*, and he gave¦129321 them a place¦129323 at the head of \add ≈table—even above the invited¦129325 guests\add*. (There were about¦129327 thirty¦129327 men.)
\v 23 And Shemuel told the cook, “Give the \add special\add* \add ≈piece of meat\add* that I \add ≈showed\add* you and said to keep aside.”
\v 24 \add ≈So\add* the cook lifted the \add ≈cooked leg\add* and \add ≈placed it in front¦129355\add* of Sha'ul.

\v 6 God's spirit¦130083 rushed on Sha'ul as he heard¦130089 the message, and \add ≈he became very angry\add*.

\p
\v 4 “\add No,\add* you haven't cheated us,” they \add ≈answered\add*. “And you haven't oppressed¦130371 us or taken¦130374 \add ≈any payments\add*.”
\p
\v 5 “Yahweh is a \add ≈your\add* witness,” he said. “And his anointed¦130386 \add king\add* is a witness today, that you have \add ≈never found¦130391 me taking anything¦130393 that wasn't mine\add*.”
\p “\add ≈We witness that\add*,” \add #they\add* \add ≈agreed\add*.
\p
\v 6 “It was Yahweh who appointed¦130405 Mosheh¦130408 and Aharon¦130411,” Shemuel continued, “and who brought¦130413 your¦130416 ancestors¦130416 out of Egypt¦130418.\x + \xo 12:6: \xt Exo 6:26.\x*
\v 7 Now present¦130421 yourselves¦130421 to Yahweh as I confront you all in \add ≈front¦130424\add* of \add *him\add* \add by telling you about\add* \add *his\add* righteousness¦130429 that he \add ≈displayed to\add* you all \add ≈as well as\add* to your ancestors¦130437 \add before you\add*:
\v 8 After¦130439 Yacob went to Egypt and your ancestors cried¦130444 out to Yahweh, then Yahweh sent Mosheh¦130453 and Aharon¦130456, and they brought¦130457 your ancestors out of Egypt and settled¦130462 them into this place¦130463.\x + \xo 12:8: \xt Exo 2:23.\x*
\v 9 Then they forgot¦130466 their¦130470 God¦130470 Yahweh, and he \add ≈allowed them to be oppressed by\add* Sisera (the commander¦130475 of the army from Hazor), and the Philistines¦130481, and the king¦130483 of Moab.

\v 10 and cried¦130488 out to Yahweh, ‘We have sinned¦130495, because we have forsaken¦130497 Yahweh and have served¦130501 the Baals and the Ashtorets¦130507. \add ≈But¦130488 if\add* you rescue us now from our enemies¦130511, we will serve¦130512 you.’\x + \xo 12:10: \xt Jdg 10:10-15.\x*
\v 11 Then¦130514 Yahweh sent¦130514 \add ≈Gideon¦130518\add*, Bedan¦130521, Yeftah, and Shimshon\f + \fr 12:11 \ft TC: This list of four names varies between different ancient manuscripts so you might find variation in other translations.\f* \add ≈to\add* rescue you all from your enemies¦130531 all around you, and \add so\add* you all \add ≈have had times of\add* living securely¦130534.\x + \xo 12:11: a \xt Jdg 7:1; \xo b \xt Jdg 4:6; \xo c \xt Jdg 11:29; \xo d \xt 1Sam 3:20.\x*

\v 16 So now \add ≈stay there\add* and you'll all see¦130623 the incredible sign that Yahweh is about¦130631 to do \add ≈in front of you\add*.

\p
\v 18 \add ≈So\add* Shemuel called¦130661 to Yahweh and \add *he\add* sent thunder¦130668 and rain that day¦130670, and all the people¦130675 \add ≈became very afraid of\add* Yahweh and Shemuel

\v 22 Yahweh won't abandon¦130765 his people because \add ≈he has an excellent reputation\add* \add to uphold\add*, \add ≈especially since he's declared\add* you all to be his people.
\v 23 Also, far be it¦130783 from me to sin¦130785 against Yahweh by not praying for you all, as well as instructing¦130790 you all in the good¦130793 and \add ≈proper\add* way¦130792.

\p
\v 3 Then¦130871 Yonatan \add ≈attacked and defeated¦130871\add* the Philistine unit that was at Geba, and the Philistines¦130875 heard¦130878 \add about it\add*. \add ≈So¦130871\add* Sha'ul \add had\add* a trumpet¦130882 blown \add ≈throughout\add* the \add ≈country, with the message\add*, “\add ≈Listen all you\add* Hebrews.”

\v 16 Sha'ul and his son Yonatan and the people¦131130 with them, were staying in Geba, \add ≈whereas\add* the Philistines¦131136 were camped at Mikmas,

\v 11 \add ≈So¦131451\add* the two of them revealed themselves to the Philistine unit, and the \add ≈soldiers\add* said¦131457, “\add ≈Hey, look\add*. The Hebrews are coming¦131461 out from the holes¦131464 there¦131468 where¦131465 they've hidden¦131466 themselves.”

\v 25 \add ≈But when they¦131736 reached\add* the forest¦131737, there was honeycomb¦131739 on the ground.
\v 26 \add ≈Although¦131764 the warriors\add* entered the forest¦131749 and saw the honey¦131752, none of them \add ≈tasted any\add* because they were afraid of the curse.
\v 27 \add ≈But¦131768\add* Yonatan hadn't heard¦131771 his father's¦131773 oath, so he dipped¦131784 his staff¦131781 into the honeycomb and \add ≈ate some honey¦131787 and felt rejuvenated\add*.
\v 28 \add ≈However, someone noticed it and mentioned\add*, “Your father made the people promise, ‘Anyone who eats food today will be cursed¦131808.’ So¦131797 the people are faint¦131815.”

\v 29 “My father's¦131821 \add ≈caused trouble¦131820 for us\add*,” Yonatan \add ≈responded\add*. “See \add ≈how much better I feel now\add* because I tasted¦131833 a little¦131834 \add bit\add* of this honey¦131835.
\v 30 Actually, if the troops¦131844 had eaten¦131842 what they'd found¦131848 from the plunder¦131845 of their¦131846 enemies¦131846 today, how much better it would have been because \add ≈we might have had an even more decisive victory over the\add* Philistines¦131855.”
\p
\v 31 That day¦131858 they killed Philistines¦131860 from Mikmas to Ayyalon, \add ≈but\add* the fighters were \add ≈totally exhausted¦131863\add*.
\v 32 \add *They\add* rushed greedily at the plunder, grabbing sheep¦131875, cattle¦131876, and calves which they¦131874 slaughtered¦131879 \add ≈right there\add* and ate¦131882 with the blood¦131886 \add still in them\add*.
\v 33 Then¦131888 King Sha'ul was told, “Look, the people are sinning¦131893 against Yahweh by eating¦131895 \add meat\add* with the blood¦131898 \add still in it\add*.”
\p “You've all acted¦131900 treacherously¦131900,” he \add ≈responded\add*, “\add ≈Now,\add* roll a big stone¦131905 \add over\add* to me.”\x + \xo 14:33: \xt Gen 9:4; Lev 7:26-27; 17:10-14; 19:26; Deu 12:16,23; 15:23.\x*

\p
\v 44 “May God¦132122 do \add ≈to me whatever he wants\add*,” Sha'ul said. “because you will certainly die, Yonatan.”

\v 13 Yishay's¦133623 three oldest sons (Eliab, Abinadab, and Shammah¦133642) had gone to the battle with Sha'ul,

\v 16 For forty¦133673 days, the Philistine¦133669 \add champion\add* came¦133668 out and presented himself in the early¦133670 morning and \add again\add* in the evening¦133671.

\v 1 Then Sha'ul \add ≈urged\add* his son Yonatan and all his servants¦135071 to \add ≈kill¦135072\add* David, \add ≈but\add* Yonatan \add ≈really liked\add* David
\v 2 and told \add *him\add*, “My father¦135090 Sha'ul \add ≈wants to get rid of you¦135091, so please¦135095 watch out\add* in the morning¦135096. \add ≈Find a hiding place¦135098 and stay¦135097 there\add*.

\v 4 \add ≈So\add* \add the next morning,\add* Yonatan spoke¦135123 well of David to his father¦135130 Sha'ul, saying, “Don't let the king¦135136 sin¦135135 against his servant¦135137, against David, because¦135143 he hasn't sinned¦135141 against you, and actually, \add ≈he's been a big help\add* to you.
\v 5 He \add ≈took his life¦135153 into his hands when he fought against\add* \add @Goliat\add*, and Yahweh \add ≈used it to save\add* all Israel. \add ≈So¦135150\add* why would you sin¦135169 against innocent¦135171 blood¦135170 by putting David to death \add ≈for no reason\add*.”
\p
\v 6 Sha'ul listened¦135178 to Yonatan, then \add *he\add* promised, “As surely as Yahweh lives, he won't be put to death¦135189.”
\v 7 \add Afterwards,\add* Yonatan called¦135191 David and told him \add ≈what had been said\add*. Then¦135191 he brought¦135203 David back \add to work for\add* Sha'ul and \add ≈things carried on as before\add*.

\p
