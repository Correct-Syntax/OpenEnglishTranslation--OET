\is1 Introduction
\is2 Author
\ip This account about the works and teachings of Yeshua was written by Luke, one of the later followers of Yeshua. Luke was believed to be a medical doctor and although many have assumed him to be a Greek, there's also a good case that he was Jewish. He was good friends with Paul and accompanied him several times as they travelled to various places to spread the good news about Yeshua the messiah. Luke was also the author of the account of the beginnings of the Christian church known commonly known as \bk Acts\bk*, and unlike most other Bibles, the \em Open English Translation\em* places these two successive accounts one after the other.
\is2 This account
\ip This account was written to Theophilus who is said to be an honoured person from Rome. He starts his account with the prophecied birth of Yohan-the-Immerser and then of Yeshua right through until he's lifted into the clouds. Luke also explains how that Yeshua is the messiah promised by God to save Jews and all non-Jews who put their trust in him.
\ip It's also told here in this document about Yeshua's mercy towards troubled people and sinners, his healing din of many who were sick or possessed by demons, his bringing dead people back to life, and his teaching. Recurring themes here include God's spirit, prayer, forgiveness of sins, the women who helped Yeshua with his work, and how believers should prepare for his return.

\s1 Introduction
\rem /s1 Dedication to Theophilus
\p
\v 1 Several people attempted¦37628 to write an account about the events that we're personally certain of
\v 2 as the ones who were eyewitnesses¦37646 and¦37647 hearers of these accounts from the beginning¦37645 handed them over to us.
\v 3 So since we had followed¦37655 all these events so carefully, it¦37653 seemed like a good idea to write¦37661 this account for you¦37660, honoured Theophilus¦37663,
\v 4 so that you could know¦37665 the definite background behind what you were taught.
\s1 The messenger foretells the birth of Yohan-the-Immerser
\rem /s1 The Birth of John the Baptist Is Announced
\rem /s1 The Birth of John the Baptist Foretold
\rem /s1 The coming of Christ
\p
\v 5 \x + \xo 1:5: \xt 1Ch 24:10.\x*It started with the priest¦37682 Zechariah and his wife¦37691 Elizabeth at the time when Herod¦37677 was the king¦37679 of Yudea¦37681. (Zechariah was in the priestly division¦37687 of Abijah¦37688, and Elizabeth was also a descendant of Aaron.)
\v 6 God¦37711 considered them both good and blameless¦37721 as they¦37704 obeyed his commandments¦37716 and regulations.
\v 7 Elizabeth¦37730 had never been able to have a child¦37726, so there was just the two of them as they were now getting older.
\p
\v 8 One time¦37745 as he was taking his rostered turn to serve God¦37757 along with his division¦37752,
\v 9 he was chosen¦37763 by lot (this was how the priests¦37762 assigned tasks) to light the incense¦37766 in the temple¦37770, and so he proceeded inside.
\v 10 A lot of people¦37780 would be praying¦37782 outside¦37783 the temple at the time when the incense¦37787 was burnt.
\v 11 At that moment, a messenger from God appeared to Zechariah, standing right there at the right of the incense¦37799 altar¦37797.
\v 12 Zechariah¦37802 got a big fright at seeing him there and started to tremble.
\v 13 But the messenger spoke, “Don't be scared Zechariah, because¦37820 your request has been listened¦37821 to, and your wife¦37827 Elizabeth will give birth to a son and you'll name¦37838 him Yohan¦37840.
\v 14 He'll bring a lot of happiness to you and you'll be proud of him¦37854—in fact many people will be glad.
\v 15 \x + \xo 1:15: \xt Num 6:3.\x*He'll be considered special in God's eyes, but he won't be allowed to drink¦37870 wine or spirits. Even while he's still¦37875 in his¦37881 mother's¦37880 womb, he'll be filled¦37874 with God's spirit¦37872.
\v 16 He will turn many children of Israel back to Yahweh, their¦37892 God¦37891.
\v 17 \x + \xo 1:17: \xt Mal 4:5-6.\x*And he will go on ahead¦37896 of God with the spirit¦37900 and the power¦37902 of Eliyah, to turn fathers¦37907 back to loving their children¦37909 and to turn career criminals towards the wisdom of godly people, to get the people ready for the master¦37917.”
\p
\v 18 Zechariah asked the messenger, “How will I know if this is true. Because¦37931 I'm an older¦37933 man¦37933 and¦37934 my¦37937 wife¦37936 is also getting old.”
\p
\v 19 \x + \xo 1:19: \xt Dan 8:16; 9:21.\x*Now the messenger rebuked him¦37948, “I am Gabriel¦37951 who stood¦37953 right in front of God¦37957 and was commanded to come here and talk to you, and to tell all of this to you.
\v 20 So hear this: Because you didn't believe¦37984 my¦37987 message¦37986, you will be made silent¦37970 and unable to speak¦37974 until¦37975 the day¦37977 that all of these¦37980 things¦37980 happen, and they certainly will happen at the proper times.”
\p
\v 21 Meanwhile, the people¦37998 outside were expecting¦38000 Zechariah to come back out, and¦38003 were wondering what could be holding him¦38009 up there inside the temple¦38012.
\v 22 But when he did emerge, he wasn't able to speak¦38019 to them. They wondering if maybe he'd seen¦38025 a vision¦38024 in the temple¦38028, and he nodded to confirm this although he remained mute.
\v 23 And after he'd finished his¦38046 rostered days¦38043 in the temple, he returned home¦38051.
\p
\v 24 As time went on, Elizabeth became pregnant and¦38066 secluded¦38067 herself¦38068 away for five¦38070 months¦38069, saying¦38071,
\v 25 “The master¦38077\f + \fr 1:25 \ft Clearly referring to \em Yahweh\em*. By this time in history, as a sign of respect the Jewish people had stopped saying God's name aloud.\f* has done this for me. At this time he's looked¦38081 down at me and taken away the public shame of my¦38085 being childless.”
\s1 God's messenger comes to Maria
\rem /s1 The Birth of Jesus Foretold
\rem /s1 The Birth of Jesus Is Announced
\p
\v 26 When Elizabeth was six months¦38091 pregnant, God¦38102 sent¦38095 his messenger Gabriel¦38098 to Nazareth¦38111, a city¦38104 in the Galilee¦38107 region.
\v 27 \x + \xo 1:27: \xt Mat 1:18.\x*Gabriel went to a young woman named Maria¦38131 who was engaged to be married to Yosef¦38120, a descendant of \add King\add* David¦38125,
\v 28 and entering the room, spoke to her¦38138, “Hello there. The master¦38145 is with you and he's chosen you to be honoured.”
\v 29 Maria was very puzzled by the statement¦38159 and¦38163 wondered what kind of greeting¦38171 it could be
\v 30 as the messenger continued, “Don't be scared, Maria¦38183, because¦38186 you¦38185 have found¦38185 God's favour¦38187
\v 31 \x + \xo 1:31: \xt Mat 1:21.\x*and listen, you will conceive¦38193 a baby and go on to give birth to a son, and you should name¦38202 him¦38203 Yeshua¦38204.
\v 32 \x + \xo 1:32-33: \xt 2Sam 7:12-13,16; Isa 9:7.\x*He will be very special and will be called¦38212 the son of the highest¦38211 one, and God¦38219 the master¦38217 will give him the throne¦38221 of David¦38222, his¦38225 ancestor.
\v 33 He will reign¦38227 over Yacob's¦38231 descendants throughout the ages, and his¦38238 kingdom¦38237 will never end¦38241.”
\p
\v 34 “How would this work,” Maria¦38245 asked the messenger, “because¦38254 I've never slept with a guy?”
\p
\v 35 “The pure¦38267 spirit¦38266 will come over you,” answered¦38261 the messenger, “and the power¦38272 of the highest¦38273 one will overshadow¦38274 you, and so the holy child¦38283 that will be born will be called¦38284 God's son.
\v 36 Also, your¦38293 relative¦38291 Elizabeth has also conceived¦38297 a son in her¦38302 old age—the one who was called¦38311 barren¦38312 is now six months¦38306 pregnant
\v 37 \x + \xo 1:37: \xt Gen 18:14.\x*because with God¦38321, his statements always come to pass.”
\p
\v 38 “Look here,” said Maria¦38328, “I'm the master's¦38333 servant girl. May everything you said come¦38334 true.” Then the messenger left her.
\s1 Maria's visit to Elizabeth
\rem /s1 Mary Visits Elizabeth
\p
\v 39 Several days¦38356 later, Maria¦38350 determined that she'd go to the town in the hills of Yudea
\v 40 where Zechariah and Elizabeth lived. She entered the house¦38372 and greeted¦38375 Elizabeth,
\v 41 and as soon as Elizabeth heard¦38381 the greeting¦38385, her baby in her womb kicked¦38390, and she was filled¦38404 with the pure¦38406 spirit¦38405
\v 42 and she¦38411 called out loudly¦38414, “Out of \add all\add* women¦38420, you¦38427 have been blessed and the baby in your¦38427 womb has been blessed.
\v 43 How could this happen to me—that the mother¦38435 of my¦38438 master¦38437 would come¦38433 and visit me!
\v 44 You see¦38442, as soon as I heard your¦38450 greeting¦38449, the baby in my¦38454 womb kicked¦38455 with excitement,
\v 45 and the woman¦38470 who believed¦38471 that everything the master¦38479 told her¦38477 will happen, she will be blessed¦38469.”

\rem /s1 The Magnificat: Mary's Song of Praise
\p
\v 46 Maria¦38482 said¦38481,
\q1 “My¦38487 soul¦38486 praises the master¦38489,
\q1
\v 47 and¦38490 my spirit¦38493 is so happy about God¦38498, my saviour¦38500,
\q1
\v 48 \x + \xo 1:48: \xt 1Sam 1:11.\x*because he noticed his¦38510 humble servant girl.
\q1 Look now, all the future generations¦38520 will consider that I was blessed¦38516
\q1
\v 49 because the powerful¦38529 one treated me incredibly,
\q1 and¦38530 his¦38535 name¦38534 is holy.
\q1
\v 50 He shows his¦38539 mercy¦38538 to multiple generations;
\q1 to those who honour him.
\q1
\v 51 His¦38554 arm is powerful¦38551;
\q1 he scatters¦38555 those who are proud¦38556 in their¦38559 hearts¦38558.
\q1
\v 52 \x + \xo 1:52: \xt Yob 5:11; 12:19.\x*He knocks kings off their thrones¦38563,
\q1 and¦38564 praises those who're humble¦38566.
\q1
\v 53 Those who're hungry, he fills with good¦38569 things¦38569,
\q1 but those who're rich, he sends away empty¦38573 handed.
\q1
\v 54 He took¦38574 good care of his¦38577 servant¦38576, Israel,
\q1 to be reminded¦38578 of mercy¦38579
\q1
\v 55 \x + \xo 1:55: \xt Gen 17:7.\x*as he spoke¦38581 to our¦38585 ancestors¦38584,
\q1 to Abraham¦38587 and his¦38591 descendants¦38590,
\q1 at the right time.”
\p
\v 56 So Maria¦38599 stayed with Elizabeth for about¦38603 three¦38606 months¦38605 before returning¦38608 back to her¦38612 own home¦38611.
\s1 The birth of Yohan-the-Immerser
\rem /s1 The Birth of John the Baptist
\p
\v 57 When Elizabeth's nine months were up, she¦38623 gave birth and¦38622 produced a son
\v 58 and her neighbours¦38628 and relatives¦38631 heard¦38626 that the master¦38636 had shown great mercy¦38638 to her, and so they celebrated along with her.
\p
\v 59 \x + \xo 1:59: \xt Lev 12:3.\x*When the baby boy was eight¦38652 days old, it was the time to circumcise¦38655 him, and \add the relatives at the ceremony\add* started calling¦38659 him Zacharias after¦38661 the name¦38663 of his¦38666 father¦38665,
\v 60 but¦38675 the baby's mother¦38671 spoke up and said¦38673, “No, he's going to be named Yohan¦38680.”
\p
\v 61 “None of your¦38695 relatives¦38693 have that name¦38700,” they¦38683 said¦38683
\v 62 and they signalled¦38704 to the father¦38707 to tell them what name¦38709 he wanted for the baby.
\p
\v 63 So Zacharias requested¦38719 a writing tablet¦38721 and wrote¦38722, “His¦38729 name¦38728 is Yohan¦38724.” Everyone was amazed
\v 64 and then suddenly his¦38745 mouth¦38744 and tongue¦38749 were freed and he was able to speak¦38752 again and started praising God¦38755.
\v 65 Everyone¦38774 who lived nearby was a bit unnerved by all this, and¦38768 the story about what happened was discussed¦38777 \add in all the homes\add* around¦38765 the hills
\v 66 and¦38805 those who heard¦38787 about it were thinking to themselves, “Who's this young child¦38800 going to turn out to be?”

\p
\v 67 Then the boy's father¦38813, Zacharias, became filled¦38815 with the pure¦38817 spirit¦38816 and¦38818 prophesied¦38819,
\q1
\v 68 “Blessed¦38823 is the master¦38824, the god¦38826 of Israel¦38828,
\q1 because¦38829 he visited¦38830 us and made a way for his¦38839 people¦38837 to be freed from slavery.
\q1
\v 69 He¦38848 brought us a voice that would lead to our salvation¦38843,
\q1 us citizens of \add the nation of King\add* David¦38848, his¦38851 servant¦38850
\q1
\v 70 (as he spoke¦38853 via the mouths¦38855 of his¦38864 holy prophets¦38863 through the age\add s\add*).
\q1
\v 71 He saved us from our¦38870 enemies¦38869,
\q1 and from the power of all the ones hating¦38876 us,
\q1
\v 72 to show mercy¦38879 to our¦38883 ancestors¦38882
\q1 and¦38884 to remind¦38885 them of his¦38888 holy agreement,
\q1
\v 73 that he had promised Abraham¦38893, our¦38896 ancestor, that he would give¦38898 us.
\q1
\v 74 He rescued¦38906 us from the power of our¦38904 enemies¦38904,
\q1 so we could serve him¦38908 without fear,
\q1
\v 75 committed to obeying him¦38914
\q1 for the rest of our¦38923 lives.
\q1
\v 76 \x + \xo 1:76: \xt Mal 3:1.\x*And you too my little¦38927 child¦38927, will be called¦38930 a prophet¦38928 of the highest¦38929 one—
\q1 going¦38931 before the master¦38937 to prepare¦38938 his¦38940 paths,
\q1
\v 77 to give¦38942 knowledge¦38943 about salvation¦38944 to his¦38947 people¦38946
\q1 so their¦38952 sins¦38950 can be forgiven¦38949
\q1
\v 78 because¦38954 God¦38957 has compassion¦38955 on us and mercy¦38956.

\q1 to guide us onto the road of peace¦38983.”
\p
\v 80 The young boy grew and his spirit¦38990 was also strengthened¦38989, and he lived in the wilderness¦38995 until¦38996 he started his ministry to \add the people of\add* Israel.

\p
\v 1 At that time, Caesar Augustus¦39013 sent a decree¦39010 that everyone throughout the empire needed to register¦39015 \add in a census\add*.
\v 2 (This census was conducted when Quirinius was the governor¦39028 of Syria.)
\v 3 Everyone had to \add officially\add* register¦39037 in the city¦39046 of their \add birth\add*.
\p
\v 4 Because Yosef was a descendant of \add King\add* David, he left the town of Nazareth¦39056 in the Galilee¦39053 \add region\add* and went¦39047 down to David's town of Bethlehem¦39068 in Yudea
\v 5 to register¦39078 along with Maria¦39081, his pregnant¦39090 fiancée.
\v 6 While they were in Bethlehem, the time¦39105 came¦39100 for her¦39115 to give birth
\v 7 and so Maria bore her¦39120 first¦39122 son and wrapped him in strips of cloth and slept him in an \add empty\add* feeding trough, because¦39133 they had missed out on the guest¦39140 room¦39137.

\p
\v 8 In that same¦39150 area, there were some shepherds¦39142 staying out in the fields¦39152 where they kept watch¦39156 over their¦39162 flocks¦39161 at night¦39158.
\v 9 A messenger sent by the master approached¦39167 them, and the master's radiance shone around¦39173 them, and they were very frightened.
\v 10 “Don't be scared,” the messenger told them, “because¦39190 I'm bringing you¦39192 a good¦39191 message¦39191 that will bring great¦39194 happiness to all people¦39201
\v 11 because¦39202 a saviour¦39206 for all people was born today¦39205 in David's town. He's the messiah¦39209—the master¦39210—
\v 12 and this is how you'll know him: you'll find a baby wrapped in strips of cloth and sleeping in a feeding trough.”
\p
\v 13 Then suddenly¦39232 lots of heavenly¦39239 soldiers joined the messenger, praising¦39241 God¦39244 and¦39245 saying¦39246,
\v 14 “Let all honour be given to God¦39250 in the highest¦39249, and¦39251 peace¦39254 on earth¦39253 to all people along with good¦39259 will.”
\p
\v 15 Then as the messengers left them and¦39287 went¦39263 \add up\add* into the sky, the shepherds¦39277 said to each other, “Well, we'll certainly go into Bethlehem¦39286 so we can see¦39288 what this was about that Yahweh¦39296 has let us know about.”
\p
\v 16 So they hurried¦39302 \add into town\add* and asked around to find Maria¦39310 and Yosef, and \add also\add* the baby sleeping in the feeding trough.
\v 17 When they met them, the explained what they had been told about the young baby.
\v 18 Everyone who heard¦39338 this was amazed at what the shepherds¦39347 told them,
\v 19 but Maria¦39353 treasured¦39355 all of these¦39359 messages¦39358 in her¦39365 heart¦39363 and \add often\add* thought about them.
\v 20 Finally the shepherds¦39370 returned¦39368 \add back to their fields\add*—they were worshipping and praising¦39373 God¦39375 for what they'd heard¦39379 and how they'd seen it exactly like they'd been told.

\v 25 Now listen, there was a man named Simeon in Yerusalem¦39483 and he was godly¦39495 and committed, waiting¦39496 for God to rescue Israel. He was \add full\add* of the pure¦39504 spirit¦39501

\p
\v 7 \x + \xo 3:7: \xt Mat 12:34; 23:33.\x*Because of that, he was telling the crowds¦40203 that went out there to be immersed¦40204 by him, “Bunch of snakes! Who warned¦40211 you all to flee from the severe¦40218 anger¦40218 that's coming¦40217?

\v 13 “Don't collect any extra on top of what you've been told to collect,” he said¦40334.
\p
\v 14 “And what about us too,” some soldiers¦40352 inquired.
\p “Don't bully people or falsely¦40374 accuse¦40374 anyone,” Yohan answered, “and¦40375 be content with your¦40379 wages¦40378.”
\p
\v 15 The people¦40383 were expecting¦40380 that the messiah¦40399 might¦40397 come \add to save them\add* and¦40384 started wondering in their¦40391 minds if maybe it was Yohan¦40394

\p
\v 9 Then the devil led him to Yerusalem¦41000 and they stood¦41002 on the highest part of the temple¦41008, where he told him, “If you're¦41015 God's son, throw¦41019 yourself¦41020 down from here,

\v 17 The scroll of the prophet¦41146 Isayah was handed¦41140 to him, and opening up the scroll, he found¦41156 the place¦41158 where¦41159 it was written¦41161,

\v 7 and that's why I never came to you¦44275 personally. However, just issue a command and then my¦44286 boy will be healed¦44283
\v 8 because I'm appointed¦44294 under authority¦44293 and have other¦44307 soldiers¦44298 under me. When I tell one of them to go, he goes, and when I tell one to come, he comes, and when I tell my¦44314 slave¦44313 to do something, he does it.”
\p
\v 9 When he¦44330 heard¦44319 that, Yeshua¦44323 was amazed and turned¦44328 to face the crowd¦44333 that was following¦44331 him and said¦44334, “\wj I can tell you that never before in all of Israel have I encountered so much faith¦44346!\wj*”

\v 11 The next day¦44370, Yeshua went to a town called¦44377 Nain, and his¦44384 followers¦44383 went with him as well as a large crowd¦44387 of people.
\v 12 As he got near the town gate, look, a dead boy was being¦44401 carried¦44401 out \add to the cemetary\add*. The mother¦44407 was now a widow¦44412 and he had been their only son, and a large number of the local residents were with her.
\v 13 When he¦44428 saw her, the master¦44430 felt sorry for her and said¦44436, “\wj Don't cry.\wj*”
\v 14 Then he went up closer and touched¦44442 the coffin¦44444, and the pallbearers stopped¦44448. Then he spoke, “\wj Young¦44451 man¦44451, I'm talking¦44453 to you: get up.\wj*”
\v 15 The dead¦44459 son sat¦44457 up and started talking¦44462, and Yeshua led him to his¦44469 mother¦44468.
\v 16 Everyone felt a bit apprehensive and they¦44476 praised¦44476 God saying¦44479, “A powerful prophet¦44481 appeared among¦44486 us,” and “God has been here with his¦44495 people¦44494.”
\p
\v 17 Then the news about Yeshua spread all around Yudea and¦44508 all the surrounding¦44512 area.

\v 18 The apprentices of Yohan-the-Immerser reported¦44518 all these¦44530 things¦44530 back to him and he choose two¦44534 of his¦44527 apprentices
\v 19 and sent¦44541 them to Yeshua¦44545 to ask, “Are you¦44551 the promised one, or should we¦44558 wait for someone else?”
\p
\v 20 So when they got to Yeshua, the two men¦44565 told him¦44563, “Yohan-the-Immerser sent¦44574 us here to ask you if you're the promised one, or should we wait for someone else?”
\p
\v 21 While they were still there, he healed¦44594 many people from their diseases¦44598 and difficulties, as well as evil¦44605 spirits¦44603 and some blind¦44607 people being able to see again,

\p
\v 24 When Yohan's messengers¦44667 had left¦44684, Yeshua started asking the crowds¦44677 about Yohan, “\wj What did you¦44684 all go out into the wilderness¦44687 to see¦44688? A reed waving in the wind¦44692?\wj*
\v 25 \wj Yes, but what did you¦44698 all go out to see¦44699? A man¦44700 dressed¦44704 in fine clothes? Well, those in nice clothes and¦44710 living in luxury¦44711 are in fine homes.\wj*

\p
\v 31 “\wj So what can I compare this generation¦44839 with?\wj*” asked Yeshua. “\wj Who are they¦44843 similar¦44844 to?\wj*
\v 32 \wj They're like little¦44848 children¦44848 sitting¦44854 in the marketplace¦44852 and calling¦44856 out to each other, ‘We played the flute¦44864 for you all but you didn't dance¦44868, then we played a sad song but you all didn't weep.’\wj*

\v 36 Another time, someone¦44932 from the Pharisees party invited Yeshua to go to his place for a meal, and so he went there and reclined¦44951 \add on a flat couch\add*.
\v 37 \x + \xo 7:37-38: \xt Jn 12:3; Mrk 14:3; Mat 26:7.\x*Then¦44975 wow, a sinful woman¦44955 from the city¦44961 who knew that he was reclining¦44969 in there, \add came into the room and\add* carrying a \add beautiful carved\add* stone flask¦44978 of scented skin-cream.
\v 38 She stood¦44982 weeping¦44991 behind¦44983 Yeshua's feet, wetting¦44995 his feet with her tears. Then she used her hair¦45004 to wipe off the tears and kissed his feet and \add rubbed\add* the lotion into them.
\v 39 When the Pharisee¦45023 who had invited¦45027 Yeshua saw this, he said to himself¦45032, “If that man¦45046 was a prophet¦45038, he'd know who she is and what kind of woman¦45046 it is that's touching¦45049 him, because¦45052 she breaks God's laws.”
\p
\v 40 “Simon¦45063,” Yeshua¦45059 asked him¦45062, “I need to tell you¦45065 something¦45066.”
\p “Tell me, teacher,” he¦45069 replied.
\p
\v 41 \add Then Yeshua told him this story:\add* “\wj Once there were two¦45081 people who had borrowed from a money¦45084 lender: one borrow five-hundred coins¦45089 and¦45092 the other¦45093 borrowed fifty¦45095.\wj*
\v 42 \wj But neither of them was able to repay him, so he¦45102 wrote-off both of their¦45105 debts. Now after that, which¦45103 one of them do you think would appreciate him more?\wj*”
\p
\v 43 “I suppose¦45120,” answered¦45114 Simon¦45118, “that it was the one who was forgiven the biggest debt.”
\p “\wj You're right,\wj*” said Yeshua.
\v 44 Then looking at the woman he said to Simon¦45142, “\wj You see this woman? I came into your¦45149 house¦45153 but you didn't give me any water¦45156 to wash my feet, yet she wet my feet with her tears¦45171 and then wiped¦45182 them off with her hair¦45178.\wj*
\v 45 \wj You didn't kiss¦45183 me \add when I entered\add*, but¦45188 this woman¦45187 hasn't stopped kissing¦45195 my¦45196 feet¦45198 since I came¦45191 in.\wj*
\v 46 \wj You didn't offer olive¦45200 oil for my head, but¦45207 she anointed my feet¦45212 with this lotion,\wj*

\p
\v 48 Then he said¦45241 to the woman, “\wj Your¦45247 sins¦45249 have been forgiven¦45244.\wj*”
\p
\v 49 The others who were reclining¦45253 in the room started to ask to each other, “Who \add does he think\add* he is to be able to even forgive¦45267 sins¦45266.”
\p
\v 50 “\wj Your¦45276 faith¦45275 has saved¦45277 you,\wj*” Yeshua said¦45268 to the woman¦45272, “\wj Go in peace¦45282.\wj*”

\p
\v 5 “\wj \add One day\add* a \add farmer\add* went out to plant some seeds. As he scattered the seeds, some of them fell along¦45400 the path where they got trampled¦45404 on and the birds¦45407 ate them.\wj*

\v 27 As they got \add out of the boat\add*, a demon-possessed¦45939 man¦45931 who had come¦45920 out of the city¦45935 had met him there. He didn't live in a house¦45957, but lived in a cemetary, and he wasn't wearing a lot.

\v 29 \add He said this\add* because¦45998 Yeshua had commanded¦45996 the evil spirit¦46001 to come¦46005 out from the man¦46010.

\v 30 “\wj What is your name¦46052?\wj*” Yeshua¦46047 asked¦46043.

\v 32 \add They could see\add* a herd of pigs being¦46094 fed on a hill, and they requested Yeshua to let them go into the pigs, and he agreed to that.

\v 48 “\wj Daughter¦46562,” Yeshua said¦46559, “your¦46566 faith¦46565 has healed¦46567 you. Go in peace¦46572.\wj*”

\v 20 One time Yeshua was \add approached\add* by some from the Pharisee¦55399 party¦55399 and asked¦55395 when God's kingdom is coming, and he answered¦55406, “\wj The arrival of God's kingdom is not some visible thing,\wj*

\p
\v 22 Then he told his followers¦55443, “\wj The time will come when you'll be wanting to see humankind's child \add again\add* even for a day, but you won't see him.\wj*
\v 23 \wj Some people will tell you all, ‘Look, there¦55468 he is!’ or ‘Hey, here he is!’ but don't¦55475 go¦55476 looking or following them\wj*

\v 25 \wj However, before that he needs to suffer¦55515 many things¦55514 and¦55517 to be rejected¦55518 by this generation¦55521.\wj*
\v 26 \x + \xo 17:26: \xt Gen 6:5-8.\x*\wj The time of \add the return of\add* humankind's child will be just like it was in Noah's time:\wj*

\v 15 \wj So they threw him out \add the gate\add* and killed¦57883 him.\wj*

\v 8 Yeshua sent¦59320 Peter and Yohan¦59324, telling them, “\wj Go on ahead and prepare¦59327 our Passover meal ready for us to eat¦59332.\wj*”
\p
\v 9 “Where¦59338 should we¦59340 prepare¦59340 it?” they¦59333 asked.
\v 10 “\wj Listen,\wj*” he said¦59348, “\wj go ahead and when you enter¦59375 the city¦59356 you'll meet a man¦59361 carrying a pitcher¦59363 of water¦59364. Follow him into the house¦59370 that he goes into.\wj*
\v 11 \wj Then tell the home-owner that the teacher¦59386 wants to know where¦59392 the guest¦59390 room is so that he can eat¦59399 the Passover meal with his followers¦59397\wj*

\v 45 \x + \xo 23:45: \xt Exo 26:31-33.\x*the sun¦61586 went dark and¦61590 the curtain¦61592 inside the temple¦61594 was torn in the middle¦61595.
\v 46 \x + \xo 23:46: \xt Psa 31:5.\x*Then Yeshua¦61601 called¦61597 out loudly¦61599, “\wj Father, I'm entrusting¦61611 my¦61616 spirit¦61615 into your¦61610 care.\wj*” and after saying that, he stopped breathing.

\v 47 When the centurion¦61634 saw how it happened, he praised God¦61642 saying¦61643, “This really was an innocent man¦61649.”

\v 50 Then, look, there was a man named Yosef on the local council¦61705. (He was a good man and godly,
\v 51 and hadn't agreed with what the council had decided and done. He was from the Jewish city¦61727 of Arimathea¦61725 and was waiting¦61734 for God's kingdom¦61738 \add to come\add*.)
\v 52 He went in to see Pilate¦61745 and requested¦61746 Yeshua's¦61750 body¦61748,
\v 53 then he¦61754 took it down \add from the stake\add* and wrapped¦61754 it in some linen¦61761 cloth¦61761 and put the body into a \add new\add* tomb¦61768 hollowed into the rock¦61769 that hadn't been used yet.
\v 54 It was now the day of preparation¦61798 and the Rest Day was about to begin.
\p
\v 55 The women¦61811 who'd come¦61814 from Galilee¦61819 followed¦61805 \add Yosef and his¦61832 men¦61811\add* and saw¦61823 the tomb¦61826 and how the body¦61831 was placed inside,

\v 1 but as soon as it dawned on Sunday morning, they went back to the tomb¦61860 taking the prepared¦61866 spices¦61867.
\v 2 There they¦61883 discovered that the stone¦61887 had been rolled¦61888 away from the entrance
\v 3 and when they¦61897 went in, the body¦61899 of the master¦61901 Yeshua¦61902 wasn't there.
\v 4 While they were still there puzzling about¦61911 what might have happened, two¦61918 men¦61917 in dazzling clothes¦61923 approached¦61920 them.
\v 5 The women were scared, \add and knelt down\add* and bowed with their¦61937 faces¦61939 close to the ground¦61944, but the men asked them, “Why are you¦61953 looking¦61953 for¦61953 the living¦61955 in the \add place of\add* the dead¦61958?
\v 6 \x + \xo 24:6-7: \xt Mrk 8:31; 9:31; 10:33-34; Mat 16:21; 17:22-23; 20:18-19; Luk 9:22; 18:31-33.\x*He's not here—he's been brought back to life. Remember how he spoke¦61969 to you all when you were still¦61971 in Galilee¦61976
\v 7 and he said, ‘\wj It's necessary¦61985 that humankind's child is handed over to sinful¦61990 people¦61989 and to be executed¦61992 on a stake¦61992, and then to \add come back to life\add* on the third¦61995 day¦61996.’\wj* ”
\v 8 Then indeed they¦61999 remembered his¦62002 words.
\p
\v 9 Then they¦62008 left the tomb¦62007 and went back \add into the city\add* and reported¦62008 all this to the eleven¦62013 apprentices and all the others.
\v 10 (The women who told this to the missionaries were Maria from Magdala¦62022, Yoanna, Maria the mother¦62029 of Yacob¦62030, and the other women who were with them.)
\v 11 However those who heard it, thought it was all just nonsense¦62049 and¦62054 didn't believe them.
\v 12 But Peter stood up and ran¦62061 off to the tomb¦62064, and when he stooped¦62066 down \add to look in\add*, he could only see the linen¦62069 cloths¦62069, so he wandered off by himself¦62077, wondering¦62078 what could have happened.

\v 13 Then, wow, two¦62085 of \add Yeshua's followers\add* were \add walking\add* to the village¦62101 of Emmaus about eleven kilometres away from Yerusalem¦62107
\v 14 and they¦62114 were discussing with each other about¦62122 all the recent events.
\v 15 After a while talking and debating¦62134, Yeshua¦62139 \add caught up with\add* them and joined them, 
\v 16 but their¦62147 eyes¦62146 were restricted¦62148 from being¦62148 able to recognise him¦62152.
\v 17 He asked them, “\wj What's¦62159 all this that you two are talking about while you walk¦62168?\wj*”
\p They stopped \add suddenly\add* and looked at him with sad faces
\v 18 and the one called Cleopas asked him¦62183, “Are you the only visitor staying in Yerusalem¦62189 who doesn't know what just happened in the last few days¦62201?”
\p
\v 19 “\wj What happened?\wj*” he asked.
\p “What happened to the man¦62225, Yeshua¦62219 from Nazareth¦62221,” they responded. “He was a prophet¦62226 who did powerful miracles and delivered a powerful message¦62233 in front of God¦62238 and all the people¦62242.
\v 20 The chief¦62251 priests¦62251 and our¦62255 rulers¦62254 handed him over to be sentenced to death¦62258, and he was executed¦62260 on a stake¦62260.
\v 21 We were hoping¦62264 that he was going¦62273 to be the one who would release Israel \add from the grip of the Romans\add*, but all that happened three days ago now.
\v 22 Then some of our women¦62296 also surprised us, because they went to his tomb¦62308 \add very\add* early¦62304 \add this morning\add*
\v 23 and couldn't find his¦62314 body¦62313, Then they came¦62316 back and told us about some vision¦62319 about messengers \add from God\add* who apparently said that he's alive.
\v 24 Some of our companions went¦62327 out to the tomb¦62336 and found¦62338 it¦62338 just as the women¦62345 had said¦62346, but they didn't see \add anyone\add*.”
\p
\v 25 “\wj Oh, you're so foolish¦62361,\wj*” he told them, “\wj and your hearts¦62365 are so reluctant to believe¦62367 everything that the prophets¦62373 wrote.\wj*
\v 26 \wj Didn't the messiah¦62380 need to suffer¦62378 all of that in order to be able to enter into all his¦62387 greatness?\wj*”
\v 27 Then starting with Moses and going through all the prophets¦62397, he explained the scriptures¦62412 to them concerning¦62414 what had been written about him there.
\p
\v 28 As they got close to the village¦62422 they were going to, he seemed¦62428 to be going on further
\v 29 but they¦62433 urged¦62433 him¦62434, “Come and stay with us because¦62439 it's almost evening¦62441 and there's not much daylight left.”
\v 30 Then when they were already ready to eat, he picked up the bread¦62470 and blessed¦62471 it, and then he broke¦62474 it and handed it out to them,
\v 31 and then their eyes¦62493 were opened¦62490 and they recognised¦62496 him. Just then he vanished¦62500,
\v 32 and they said¦62507 to each other, “Weren't our¦62515 hearts¦62514 burning when he was speaking¦62523 to us on the road¦62528 and explaining the scriptures¦62536 to us?”
\p
\v 33 That very hour¦62542 they \add packed up and\add* headed back to Yerusalem¦62545 where they found¦62547 that the eleven¦62551 and the others with them had gathered¦62548 together
\v 34 saying¦62556, “The master¦62562 really¦62559 has come back to life—he¦62561 was seen¦62565 by Simon¦62567 \add Peter\add*!”

\v 36 As they were still talking¦62589 about these¦62586 things¦62586, Yeshua himself¦62591 \add suddenly\add* was there standing in the room and¦62599 told them, “\wj Peace¦62606 to you¦62607 all.\wj*”
\p
\v 37 However, they¦62617 got a fright¦62615 and¦62614 then were terrified¦62609 thinking¦62617 that it¦62619 was a spirit¦62619.
\v 38 Then he spoke to them \add again\add*, “\wj Why are you all upset, and why are you thinking such stuff?\wj*
\v 39 \wj Look at my¦62646 hands¦62644 and feet¦62650 and you'll see that it's me. Touch¦62659 me and look, because¦62663 spirits¦62665 don't¦62672 have solid bodies like you can see that I have.\wj*”
\p
\v 40 Then he¦62685 showed¦62685 them his hands¦62689 and¦62690 his feet¦62692.
\v 41 Some of them, still¦62693 not believing¦62695, had a mixture of happiness and doubt, and he asked them, “\wj Have you got anything here to eat?\wj*”
\v 42 They handed¦62716 him¦62717 a piece of broiled¦62719 fish¦62718,
\v 43 and he¦62730 took it and ate¦62730 it in front of them.
\p
\v 44 Then he told them, “\wj While I was still¦62745 with you all I told you those messages¦62739 of mine, and how that everything written¦62759 about me by Moses and the prophets¦62767 and in the songs¦62769, it's all going to be fulfilled¦62755.\wj*”
\v 45 Then he opened¦62774 their¦62775 minds to be able to understand¦62779 the scriptures¦62782, and he told them,
\v 46 “\wj It was written¦62788 that the messiah¦62794 would suffer¦62792 and¦62796 to come back to life on the third¦62801 day¦62802,\wj*
\v 47 \wj and¦62803 that his¦62809 name¦62808 will be proclaimed¦62804 \add as the authority\add* to forgive¦62813 the sins¦62814 \add of the people\add* when they repent¦62810—\add people\add* from every country beginning \add here\add* in Yerusalem¦62825.\wj*
\v 48 \wj You all are witnesses¦62830 of all that.\wj*
