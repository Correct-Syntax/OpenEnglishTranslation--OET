\mt2 being the account of Yeshua's ministry
\is1 Introduction
\is2 Author
\ip This account about the works and teachings of Yeshua was written by Luke, one of the later followers of Yeshua. Luke was believed to be a medical doctor and although many have assumed him to be a Greek, there's also a good case that he was Jewish. He was good friends with Paul and accompanied him several times as they travelled to various places to spread the good message about Yeshua the messiah. Luke was also the author of the account of the beginnings of the Christian church known commonly known as \bk Acts\bk*, and unlike most other Bibles, the \em Open English Translation\em* places these two successive accounts one after the other.
\is2 This account
\ip This account was written to Theophilus who is said to be an honoured person from Rome. He starts his account with the prophesied birth of Yohan-the-Immerser and then of Yeshua right through until he's lifted into the clouds. Luke also explains how that Yeshua is the messiah promised by God to save Jews and all non-Jews who put their trust in him.
\ip It's also told here in this document about Yeshua's mercy towards troubled people and sinners, his healing din of many who were sick or possessed by demons, his bringing dead people back to life, and his teaching. Recurring themes here include God's spirit, prayer, forgiveness of sins, the women who helped Yeshua with his work, and how believers should prepare for his return.

\s1 Introduction
\rem /s1 Dedication to Theophilus
\p
\v 1 Several people attempted¦37621 to write an account about the events that we're personally certain of
\v 2 as the ones who were eyewitnesses¦37639 and¦37640 hearers of these accounts from the beginning¦37638 handed them over to us.
\v 3 So since we had followed¦37648 all these events so carefully, it¦37646 seemed like a good idea to write¦37654 this account for you¦37653, honoured Theophilus¦37656,
\v 4 so that you could know¦37658 the definite background behind what you were taught.
\s1 The messenger foretells the birth of Yohan-the-Immerser
\rem /s1 The Birth of John the Baptist Is Announced

\rem /s1 The coming of Christ
\p
\v 5 \x + \xo 1:5: \xt 1Ch 24:10.\x*It started with the priest¦37675 Zechariah and his wife¦37684 Elizabeth at the time when Herod¦37670 was the king¦37672 of Yudea¦37674. (Zechariah was in the priestly division¦37680 of Abijah¦37681, and Elizabeth was also a descendant of Aaron.)
\v 6 \nd God¦37704\nd* considered them both good and blameless¦37714 as they¦37697 obeyed his commandments¦37709 and regulations.
\v 7 Elizabeth¦37723 had never been able to have a child¦37719, so there was just the two of them as they were now getting older.
\p
\v 8 One time¦37738 as he was taking his rostered turn to serve \nd God¦37750\nd* along with his division¦37745,
\v 9 he was chosen¦37756 by lot (this was how the priests¦37755 assigned tasks) to light the incense¦37759 in the temple¦37763, and so he proceeded inside.
\v 10 A lot of people¦37773 would be praying¦37775 outside¦37776 the temple at the time when the incense¦37780 was burnt.
\v 11 At that moment, a messenger¦37784 from God appeared to Zechariah, standing right there at the right of the incense¦37792 altar¦37790.
\v 12 Zechariah¦37795 got a big fright at seeing him there and started to tremble.
\v 13 But the messenger¦37808 spoke, “Don't be scared Zechariah, because¦37813 your request has been listened¦37814 to, and your wife¦37820 Elizabeth will give birth to a son and you'll name¦37831 him Yohan¦37833.
\v 14 He'll bring a lot of happiness to you and you'll be proud of him¦37847—in fact many people will be glad.
\v 15 \x + \xo 1:15: \xt Num 6:3.\x*He'll be considered special in God's eyes, but he won't be allowed to drink¦37863 wine or \nd spirits\nd*. Even while he's still¦37868 in his¦37874 mother's¦37873 womb, he'll be filled¦37867 with God's \nd spirit¦37865\nd*.
\v 16 He will turn many children of Israel back to Yahweh, their¦37885 \nd God¦37884\nd*.
\v 17 \x + \xo 1:17: \xt Mal 4:5-6.\x*And he will go on ahead¦37889 of God with the spirit¦37893 and the power¦37895 of Eliyah, to turn fathers¦37900 back to loving their children¦37902 and to turn career criminals towards the wisdom of godly people, to get the people ready for the \nd master¦37910\nd*.”
\p
\v 18 Zechariah asked the messenger¦37918, “How will I know if this is true. Because¦37924 I'm an older¦37926 man¦37926 and¦37927 my¦37930 wife¦37929 is also getting old.”
\p
\v 19 \x + \xo 1:19: \xt Dan 8:16; 9:21.\x*Now the messenger¦37939 rebuked him¦37941, “I am Gabriel¦37944 who stood¦37946 right in front of \nd God¦37950\nd* and was commanded to come here and talk to you, and to tell all of this to you.
\v 20 So hear this: Because you didn't believe¦37977 my¦37980 message¦37979, you will be made silent¦37963 and unable to speak¦37967 until¦37968 the day¦37970 that all of these¦37973 things¦37973 happen, and they certainly will happen at the proper times.”
\p
\v 21 Meanwhile, the people¦37991 outside were expecting¦37993 Zechariah to come back out, and¦37996 were wondering what could be holding him¦38002 up there inside the temple¦38005.
\v 22 But when he did emerge, he wasn't able to speak¦38012 to them. They wondering if maybe he'd seen¦38018 a vision¦38017 in the temple¦38021, and he nodded to confirm this although he remained mute.
\v 23 And after he'd finished his¦38039 rostered days¦38036 in the temple, he returned home¦38044.
\p
\v 24 As time went on, Elizabeth became pregnant and¦38059 secluded¦38060 herself¦38061 away for five¦38063 months¦38062, saying¦38064,
\v 25 “The \nd master¦38070\nd*\f + \fr 1:25 \ft Clearly referring to \em Yahweh\em*. By this time in history, as a sign of respect the Jewish people had stopped saying God's name aloud.\f* has done this for me. At this time he's looked¦38074 down at me and taken away the public shame of my¦38078 being childless.”
\s1 God's messenger comes to Maria
\rem /s1 The Birth of Jesus Foretold
\rem /s1 The Birth of Jesus Is Announced
\p
\v 26 When Elizabeth was six months¦38084 pregnant, \nd God¦38095\nd* sent¦38088 his messenger¦38090 Gabriel¦38091 to Nazareth¦38104, a city¦38097 in the Galilee¦38100 region.
\v 27 \x + \xo 1:27: \xt Mat 1:18.\x*Gabriel went to a young woman named Maria¦38124 who was engaged to be married to Yosef, a descendant of \add King\add* David¦38118,
\v 28 and entering the room, spoke to her¦38131, “Hello there. The \nd master¦38138\nd* is with you and he's chosen you to be honoured.”
\v 29 Maria was very puzzled by the statement¦38152 and¦38156 wondered what kind of greeting¦38164 it could be
\v 30 as the messenger¦38170 continued, “Don't be scared, Maria¦38176, because¦38179 you¦38178 have found¦38178 God's favour¦38180
\v 31 \x + \xo 1:31: \xt Mat 1:21.\x*and listen, you will conceive¦38186 a baby and go on to give birth to a son, and you should name¦38195 him¦38196 \nd Yeshua¦38197\nd*.
\v 32 \x + \xo 1:32-33: \xt 2Sam 7:12-13,16; Isa 9:7.\x*He will be very special and will be called¦38205 the son of the highest¦38204 one, and \nd God¦38212\nd* the \nd master¦38210\nd* will give him the throne¦38214 of David¦38215, his¦38218 ancestor.
\v 33 He will reign¦38220 over Yacob's¦38224 descendants throughout the ages, and his¦38231 kingdom¦38230 will never end¦38234.”
\p
\v 34 “How would this work,” Maria¦38238 asked the messenger¦38242, “because¦38247 I've never slept with a guy?”
\p
\v 35 “The holy \nd spirit¦38259\nd* will come over you,” answered¦38254 the messenger¦38256, “and the power¦38265 of the highest¦38266 one will overshadow¦38267 you, and so the holy child¦38276 that will be born will be called¦38277 God's son.
\v 36 Also, your¦38286 relative¦38284 Elizabeth has also conceived¦38290 a son in her¦38295 old age—the one who was called¦38304 barren¦38305 is now six months¦38299 pregnant
\v 37 \x + \xo 1:37: \xt Gen 18:14.\x*because with \nd God¦38314\nd*, his statements always come to pass.”
\p
\v 38 “Look here,” said Maria¦38321, “I'm the \nd master's¦38326\nd* servant girl. May everything you said come true.” Then the messenger¦38339 left her.
\s1 Maria's visit to Elizabeth
\rem /s1 Mary Visits Elizabeth
\p
\v 39 Several days¦38347 later, Maria¦38343 determined that she'd go to the town in the hills of Yudea
\v 40 where Zechariah and Elizabeth lived. She entered the house¦38363 and greeted¦38366 Elizabeth,
\v 41 and as soon as Elizabeth heard¦38372 the greeting¦38376, her baby in her womb kicked¦38381, and she was filled¦38395 with the holy \nd spirit¦38396\nd*
\v 42 and she¦38402 called out loudly¦38405, “Out of \add all\add* women¦38411, you¦38418 have been blessed and the baby in your¦38418 womb has been blessed.
\v 43 How could this happen to me—that the mother¦38426 of my¦38429 \nd master¦38428\nd* would come¦38424 and visit me!
\v 44 You see¦38433, as soon as I heard your¦38441 greeting¦38440, the baby in my¦38445 womb kicked¦38446 with excitement,
\v 45 and the woman¦38461 who believed¦38462 that everything the \nd master¦38470\nd* told her¦38468 will happen, she will be blessed¦38460.”

\p
\v 46 Maria¦38473 said¦38472,
\q1 “My¦38478 soul¦38477 praises the \nd master¦38480\nd*,
\q1
\v 47 and¦38481 my spirit¦38484 is so happy about \nd God¦38489\nd*, my saviour¦38491,
\q1
\v 48 \x + \xo 1:48: \xt 1Sam 1:11.\x*because he noticed his¦38501 humble servant girl.
\q1 Look now, all the future generations¦38511 will consider that I was blessed¦38507
\q1
\v 49 because the powerful¦38520 one treated me incredibly,
\q1 and¦38521 his¦38526 name¦38525 is holy.
\q1
\v 50 He shows his¦38530 mercy¦38529 to multiple generations;
\q1 to those who honour him.
\q1
\v 51 His¦38545 arm is powerful¦38542;
\q1 he scatters¦38546 those who are proud¦38547 in their¦38550 hearts¦38549.
\q1
\v 52 \x + \xo 1:52: \xt Yob 5:11; 12:19.\x*He knocks kings off their thrones¦38554,
\q1 and¦38555 praises those who're humble¦38557.
\q1
\v 53 Those who're hungry, he fills with good¦38560 things¦38560,
\q1 but those who're rich, he sends away empty¦38564 handed.
\q1
\v 54 He took¦38565 good care of his¦38568 servant¦38567, Israel,
\q1 to be reminded¦38569 of mercy¦38570
\q1
\v 55 \x + \xo 1:55: \xt Gen 17:7.\x*as he spoke¦38572 to our¦38576 ancestors¦38575,
\q1 to Abraham¦38578 and his¦38582 descendants¦38581,
\q1 at the right time.”
\p
\v 56 So Maria¦38590 stayed with Elizabeth for about¦38594 three¦38597 months¦38596 before returning¦38599 back to her¦38603 own home¦38602.
\s1 The birth of Yohan-the-Immerser
\rem /s1 The Birth of John the Baptist
\p
\v 57 When Elizabeth's nine months were up, she¦38614 gave birth and¦38613 produced a son
\v 58 and her neighbours¦38619 and relatives¦38622 heard¦38617 that the \nd master¦38627\nd* had shown great mercy¦38629 to her, and so they celebrated along with her.
\p
\v 59 \x + \xo 1:59: \xt Lev 12:3.\x*When the baby boy was eight¦38643 days old, it was the time to circumcise¦38646 him, and \add the relatives at the ceremony\add* started calling¦38650 him Zacharias after¦38652 the name¦38654 of his¦38657 father¦38656,
\v 60 but¦38666 the baby's mother¦38662 spoke up and said¦38664, “No, he's going to be named Yohan¦38671.”
\p
\v 61 “None of your¦38686 relatives¦38684 have that name¦38691,” they¦38674 said¦38674
\v 62 and they signalled¦38695 to the father¦38698 to tell them what name¦38700 he wanted for the baby.
\p
\v 63 So Zacharias requested¦38710 a writing tablet¦38712 and wrote¦38713, “His¦38720 name¦38719 is Yohan¦38715.” Everyone was amazed
\v 64 and then suddenly his¦38736 mouth¦38735 and tongue¦38740 were freed and he was able to speak¦38743 again and started praising \nd God¦38746\nd*.
\v 65 Everyone¦38765 who lived nearby was a bit unnerved by all this, and¦38759 the story about what happened was discussed¦38768 \add in all the homes\add* around¦38756 the hills
\v 66 and those who heard¦38778 about it were thinking to themselves, “Who's this young child¦38791 going to turn out to be?”

\p
\v 67 Then the boy's father¦38804, Zacharias, became filled¦38806 with the holy \nd spirit¦38807\nd* and¦38809 prophesied¦38810,
\q1
\v 68 “Blessed¦38814 is the \nd master¦38815\nd*, the \nd god¦38817\nd* of Israel¦38819,
\q1 because¦38820 he visited¦38821 us and made a way for his¦38830 people¦38828 to be freed from slavery.
\q1
\v 69 He brought us a voice that would lead to our salvation¦38834,
\q1 us citizens of \add the nation of King\add* David¦38839, his¦38842 servant¦38841
\q1
\v 70 (as he spoke¦38844 via the mouths¦38846 of his¦38855 holy prophets¦38854 through the age\add s\add*).
\q1
\v 71 He saved us from our¦38861 enemies¦38860,
\q1 and from the power of all the ones hating¦38867 us,
\q1
\v 72 to show mercy¦38870 to our¦38874 ancestors¦38873
\q1 and¦38875 to remind¦38876 them of his¦38879 holy agreement,
\q1
\v 73 that he had promised Abraham¦38884, our¦38887 ancestor, that he would give¦38889 us.
\q1
\v 74 He rescued¦38897 us from the power of our enemies¦38895,
\q1 so we could serve him¦38899 without fear,
\q1
\v 75 committed to obeying him¦38905
\q1 for the rest of our¦38914 lives.
\q1
\v 76 \x + \xo 1:76: \xt Mal 3:1.\x*And you too my little¦38918 child¦38918, will be called¦38921 a prophet¦38919 of the highest¦38920 one—
\q1 going¦38922 before the \nd master¦38928\nd* to prepare¦38929 his¦38931 paths,
\q1
\v 77 to give¦38933 knowledge¦38934 about salvation¦38935 to his¦38938 people¦38937
\q1 so their¦38943 sins¦38941 can be forgiven¦38940
\q1
\v 78 because¦38945 \nd God¦38948\nd* has compassion¦38946 on us and mercy¦38947.

\q1 to guide us onto the road of peace¦38974.”
\p
\v 80 The young boy grew and his spirit¦38981 was also strengthened¦38980, and he lived in the wilderness¦38986 until¦38987 he started his ministry to \add the people of\add* Israel.

\p
\v 1 At that time, Caesar Augustus¦39004 sent a decree¦39001 that everyone throughout the empire needed to register¦39006 \add in a census\add*.
\v 2 (This census was conducted when Quirinius was the governor¦39019 of Syria.)
\v 3 Everyone had to \add officially\add* register¦39028 in the city¦39037 of their \add birth\add*.
\p
\v 4 Because Yosef was a descendant of \add King\add* David, he left the town of Nazareth¦39047 in the Galilee¦39044 \add region\add* and went¦39038 down to David's town of Bethlehem¦39059 in Yudea¦39051
\v 5 to register¦39069 along with Maria¦39072, his pregnant¦39081 fiancée.
\v 6 While they were in Bethlehem, the time¦39096 came for her¦39106 to give birth
\v 7 and so Maria bore her¦39111 first¦39113 son and wrapped him in strips of cloth and slept him in an \add empty\add* feeding trough, because¦39124 they had missed out on the guest¦39131 room¦39128.

\p
\v 8 In that same¦39141 area, there were some shepherds¦39133 staying out in the fields¦39143 where they kept watch¦39147 over their¦39153 flocks¦39152 at night¦39149.
\v 9 A messenger¦39156 sent by the master approached¦39158 them, and the master's radiance shone around¦39164 them, and they were very frightened.
\v 10 “Don't be scared,” the messenger¦39177 told them, “because¦39181 I'm bringing you¦39183 a good¦39182 message¦39182 that will bring great¦39185 happiness to all people¦39192
\v 11 because¦39193 a saviour¦39197 for all people was born today¦39196 in David's town. He's the \nd messiah¦39200\nd*—the \nd master¦39201\nd*—
\v 12 and this is how you'll know him: you'll find a baby wrapped in strips of cloth and sleeping in a feeding trough.”
\p
\v 13 Then suddenly¦39223 lots of heavenly¦39230 soldiers joined the messenger¦39227, praising¦39232 \nd God¦39235\nd* and¦39236 saying¦39237,
\v 14 “Let all honour be given to \nd God¦39241\nd* in the highest¦39240, and¦39242 peace¦39245 on earth¦39244 to all people along with good¦39250 will.”
\p
\v 15 Then as the messengers¦39263 left them and¦39278 went¦39254 \add up\add* into the sky, the shepherds¦39268 said to each other, “Well, we'll certainly go into Bethlehem¦39277 so we can see¦39279 what this was about that Yahweh has let us know about.”
\p
\v 16 So they hurried¦39293 \add into town\add* and asked around to find Maria¦39301 and Yosef, and \add also\add* the baby sleeping in the feeding trough.
\v 17 When they met them, the explained what they had been told about the young baby.
\v 18 Everyone who heard¦39329 this was amazed at what the shepherds¦39338 told them,
\v 19 but Maria¦39344 treasured¦39346 all of these¦39350 messages¦39349 in her¦39356 heart¦39354 and \add often\add* thought about them.
\v 20 Finally the shepherds¦39361 returned¦39359 \add back to their fields\add*—they were worshipping and praising¦39364 \nd God¦39366\nd* for what they'd heard¦39370 and how they'd seen it exactly like they'd been told.

\v 26 and the \nd spirit¦39507\nd* had told him that he wouldn't die without seeing Yahweh's \nd messiah¦39519\nd*.
\v 27 He had come to the temple¦39528 listening to the \nd spirit¦39525\nd* at just the same time¦39531 as the parents brought in the baby \nd Yeshua¦39538\nd* in order to follow the rituals for new parents.
\v 28 Simeon took the baby into his arms and blessed¦39560 \nd God¦39563\nd* and said¦39565,
\v 29 “Now, Yahweh, you can send your¦39570 slave¦39569 away in peace¦39577 as you promised
\v 30 because¦39578 I've set my¦39582 eyes¦39581 on your¦39585 salvation¦39584
\v 31 which¦39586 you¦39587 have prepared¦39587 in front of everyone:

\p
\v 33 The baby's parents were amazed¦39613 at the things¦39615 being¦39616 spoken¦39616 about him,
\v 34 and Simeon blessed¦39620 them and said¦39625 to Maria¦39627, “Listen, this boy has been chosen to cause both the rise and the fall of many people in Israel, and \add sent as\add* a sign¦39645 but one which many people will oppose.
\v 35 Also even as you¦39648 experience incredible grief in the future, it will allow the thoughts of many hearts¦39661 to be revealed¦39657.”

\v 36 Also there was a prophetess¦39667 named Hanna¦39666 (the daughter¦39668 of Phanuel from the tribe¦39671 of Asher). She was very elderly, having been married for seven¦39686 years¦39685,
\v 37 and then had been widowed¦39694 for eighty-four¦39699 years¦39697. She was always at the temple¦39709, serving¦39717 night¦39718 and day¦39720 in prayer and fasting¦39710.
\v 38 She also approached¦39727 the baby around the same¦39724 time, and praised¦39728 God and spoke about the boy to everyone in Yerusalem¦39741 who was waiting¦39738 for God to free them.

\v 41 \x + \xo 2:41: \xt Exo 12:1-27; Deu 16:1-8.\x*Every year¦39804 Yeshua's family would go down to Jerusalem for the Passover celebrations.
\v 42 One time when he was twelve¦39820 years¦39817 old, they went to celebrate the Passover there as usual,
\v 43 and when it was all over and they started on their return¦39848, the lad stayed there in Jerusalem but his¦39868 parents¦39866 weren't aware of it.
\v 44 They thought¦39870 he was with others in the group, but at the end of the day's hiking when they looked for him among¦39885 the relatives¦39887 and acquaintances¦39892,
\v 45 they couldn't find him, so they returned¦39898 to Jerusalem¦39900 to look for him.
\v 46 It was only after¦39906 three¦39908 days¦39907 that they¦39909 found¦39909 him¦39910 in the temple¦39914, sitting¦39915 with the \add religious\add* teachers¦39919 there—sometimes listening to them, and¦39923 sometimes asking¦39924 them questions.
\v 47 Everyone who heard the conversations were amazed¦39927 and his¦39939 intelligence¦39935 and knowledge.
\v 48 When his parents found him, they were astonished¦39943 and his mother¦39949 asked, “Son, how could you do this to us? Your¦39962 father¦39961 and I have been frantic looking¦39971 for¦39971 you!”
\p
\v 49 “Why did you all need to look for me?” he answered. “Didn't you both know that it's good for me to be in my¦39990 father's¦39989 house¦39987?”
\v 50 But they didn't really understand¦39999 what he meant.
\p
\v 51 After that, he went back to Nazareth¦40012 with them and continued to be obedient to them,

\p
\v 7 \x + \xo 3:7: \xt Mat 12:34; 23:33.\x*Because of that, he was telling the crowds¦40194 that went out there to be immersed¦40195 by him, “Bunch of snakes! Who warned¦40202 you all to flee from the severe¦40209 anger¦40209 that's coming¦40208?

\v 13 “Don't collect any extra on top of what you've been told to collect,” he said¦40325.

\v 14 “And what about us too,” some soldiers¦40343 inquired.
\p “Don't bully people or falsely¦40365 accuse¦40365 anyone,” Yohan answered, “and¦40366 be content with your¦40370 wages¦40369.”
\p
\v 15 The people¦40374 were expecting¦40371 that the \nd messiah¦40390\nd* might¦40388 come \add to save them\add* and¦40375 started wondering in their¦40382 minds if maybe it was Yohan¦40385

\v 5 because he loves us Jews and he built¦44207 the \add local\add* meeting¦44204 hall¦44204 for us.”
\p
\v 6 So \nd Yeshua¦44212\nd* went with them but as they got closer to the house¦44231, the commander had sent¦44232 some friends¦44241 to tell him, “\nd Master¦44245\nd*, don't¦44224 trouble¦44247 yourself because¦44249 I'm not worthy¦44251 enough to have you enter my¦44258 home
\v 7 and that's why I never came to you¦44265 personally. However, just issue a command and then my¦44276 boy will be healed¦44273
\v 8 because I'm appointed¦44284 under authority¦44283 and have other¦44297 soldiers¦44288 under me. When I tell one of them to go, he goes, and when I tell one to come, he comes, and when I tell my¦44304 slave¦44303 to do something, he does it.”
\p
\v 9 When he heard¦44309 that, \nd Yeshua¦44313\nd* was amazed and turned¦44318 to face the crowd¦44323 that was following¦44321 him and said¦44324, “\wj I can tell you that never before in all of Israel have I encountered so much faith¦44336!\wj*”

\v 11 The next day¦44360, Yeshua went to a town called¦44367 Nain, and his¦44374 followers went with him as well as a large crowd¦44377 of people.
\v 12 As he got near the town gate, look, a dead boy was being¦44391 carried¦44391 out \add to the cemetery\add*. The mother¦44397 was now a widow¦44402 and he had been their only son, and a large number of the local residents were with her.
\v 13 When he saw her, the \nd master¦44420\nd* felt sorry for her and said¦44426, “\wj Don't cry.\wj*”
\v 14 Then he went up closer and touched¦44432 the coffin¦44434, and the pallbearers stopped¦44438. Then he spoke, “\wj Young¦44441 man¦44441, I'm talking¦44443 to you: get up.\wj*”
\v 15 The dead¦44449 son sat¦44447 up and started talking¦44452, and Yeshua led him to his¦44459 mother¦44458.
\v 16 Everyone felt a bit apprehensive and they¦44466 praised¦44466 God saying¦44469, “A powerful prophet¦44471 appeared among¦44476 us,” and “God has been here with his¦44485 people¦44484.”
\p
\v 17 Then the news about Yeshua spread all around Yudea¦44495 and¦44498 all the surrounding¦44502 area.

\v 18 The apprentices of Yohan-the-Immerser reported¦44508 all these¦44520 things¦44520 back to him and he choose two¦44524 of his¦44517 apprentices
\v 19 and sent¦44531 them to \nd Yeshua¦44535\nd* to ask, “Are you¦44541 the promised one, or should we¦44548 wait for someone else?”
\p
\v 20 So when they got to Yeshua, the two men¦44555 told him¦44553, “Yohan-the-Immerser sent¦44564 us here to ask you if you're the promised one, or should we wait for someone else?”
\p
\v 21 While they were still there, he healed¦44584 many people from their diseases¦44588 and difficulties, as well as evil¦44595 spirits¦44593 and some blind¦44597 people being able to see again,

\p
\v 24 When Yohan's messengers¦44657 had left¦44674, Yeshua started asking the crowds¦44667 about Yohan, “\wj What did you¦44674 all go out into the wilderness¦44677 to see¦44678? A reed waving in the wind¦44682?\wj*

\p
\v 31 “\wj So what can I compare this generation¦44830 with?\wj*” asked Yeshua. “\wj Who are they¦44834 similar¦44835 to?\wj*
\v 32 \wj They're like little¦44839 children¦44839 sitting¦44845 in the marketplace¦44843 and calling¦44847 out to each other, ‘We played the flute¦44855 for you all but you didn't dance¦44859, then we played a sad song but you all didn't weep.’\wj*

\v 36 Another time, someone¦44923 from the Pharisees party invited Yeshua to go to his place for a meal, and so he went there and reclined¦44942 \add on a flat couch\add*.
\v 37 \x + \xo 7:37-38: \xt Jn 12:3; Mrk 14:3; Mat 26:7.\x*Then¦44966 wow, a sinful woman¦44946 from the city¦44952 who knew that he was reclining¦44960 in there, \add came into the room and\add* carrying a \add beautiful carved\add* stone flask¦44969 of scented skin-cream.
\v 38 She stood¦44973 weeping¦44982 behind¦44974 Yeshua's feet, wetting¦44986 his feet with her tears. Then she used her hair¦44995 to wipe off the tears and kissed his feet and \add rubbed\add* the lotion into them.
\v 39 When the Pharisee¦45014 who had invited¦45018 Yeshua saw this, he said to himself¦45023, “If that man was a prophet¦45029, he'd know who she is and what kind of woman¦45037 it is that's touching¦45040 him, because¦45043 she breaks God's laws.”
\p
\v 40 “Simon¦45054,” \nd Yeshua¦45050\nd* asked him, “I need to tell you something¦45057.”
\p “Tell me, teacher,” he replied.
\p
\v 41 \add Then Yeshua told him this story:\add* “\wj Once there were two¦45072 people who had borrowed from a money¦45075 lender: one borrow five-hundred coins¦45080 and¦45083 the other¦45084 borrowed fifty¦45086.\wj*
\v 42 \wj But neither of them was able to repay him, so he¦45093 wrote-off both of their¦45096 debts. Now after that, which¦45094 one of them do you think would appreciate him more?\wj*”
\p
\v 43 “I suppose¦45111,” answered¦45105 Simon¦45109, “that it was the one who was forgiven the biggest debt.”
\p “\wj You're right,\wj*” said Yeshua.
\v 44 Then looking at the woman he said to Simon¦45133, “\wj You see this woman? I came into your¦45140 house¦45144 but you didn't give me any water¦45147 to wash my feet, yet she wet my feet with her tears¦45162 and then wiped¦45173 them off with her hair¦45169.\wj*

\v 46 \wj You¦45191 didn't offer olive¦45191 oil for my head, but¦45198 she anointed my feet¦45203 with this lotion,\wj*

\p
\v 48 Then he said¦45232 to the woman, “\wj Your¦45238 sins¦45240 have been forgiven¦45235.\wj*”
\p
\v 49 The others who were reclining¦45244 in the room started to ask to each other, “Who \add does he think\add* he is to be able to even forgive¦45258 sins¦45257.”

\v 50 “\wj Your¦45267 faith¦45266 has saved¦45268 you,\wj*” Yeshua said¦45259 to the woman¦45263, “\wj Go in peace¦45273.\wj*”

\p
\v 5 “\wj \add One day\add* a \add farmer\add* went out to plant some seeds. As he scattered the seeds, some of them fell along¦45391 the path where they got trampled¦45395 on and the birds¦45398 ate them.\wj*

\p
\v 46 “\wj Someone¦46504 touched¦46502 me,\wj*” \nd Yeshua¦46500\nd* responded, “\wj because¦46506 I felt power¦46509 going out from me.\wj*”
\v 47 Then the woman¦46517 now saw that she wouldn't get away with it, came¦46524 to Yeshua shaking, and knelt down at his feet. She told him in front of all the people¦46540 why she had touched¦46531 his \add clothes\add* and how she'd been immediately¦46546 healed¦46545.
\v 48 “\wj Daughter¦46553,” Yeshua said¦46550, “your¦46557 faith¦46556 has healed¦46558 you. Go in peace¦46563.\wj*”

\v 13 and called out, “\nd Yeshua¦55281\nd*, master¦55282, show mercy¦55283 to us.”

\v 14 \x + \xo 17:14: \xt Lev 14:1-32.\x*When he saw them, Yeshua called back, “\wj Go and ask the priests¦55300 to inspect you.\wj*” \add So they went off,\add* and as they were walking, they were healed.
\v 15 One of them, seeing that his skin was healed¦55315, came back and could be heard loudly¦55321 praising \nd God¦55325\nd*,
\v 16 and he knelt down in front of Yeshua and thanked¦55335 him. This man was from Samaria¦55341.
\v 17 “\wj Weren't there ten¦55352 of you that were healed?\wj*” \nd Yeshua¦55345\nd* asked. “\wj Where's the \add other\add* nine¦55357?\wj*

\v 20 One time Yeshua was \add approached\add* by some from the Pharisee¦55393 party¦55393 and asked¦55389 when God's kingdom is coming, and he answered¦55400, “\wj The arrival of God's kingdom is not some visible thing,\wj*
\v 21 \wj and they won't be shouting, ‘Look, here it is!’ or ‘There¦55420 it is!’, because you see¦55423, God's kingdom¦55426 is inside¦55429 you all.\wj*”
\p
\v 22 Then he told his followers, “\wj The time will come when you'll be wanting to see humanity's child \add again\add* even for a day, but you won't see him.\wj*
\v 23 \wj Some people will tell you all, ‘Look, there¦55462 he is!’ or ‘Hey, here he is!’ but don't¦55469 go¦55470 looking or following them\wj*

\v 25 \wj However, before that he needs to suffer¦55509 many things¦55508 and¦55511 to be rejected¦55512 by this generation¦55515.\wj*
\v 26 \x + \xo 17:26: \xt Gen 6:5-8.\x*\wj The time of \add the return of\add* humanity's child will be just like it was in Noah's time:\wj*

\v 9 Then Yeshua also told this parable¦55933 to some who felt they they were guiltless before God because of their own \add goodness\add*, and so they scorned¦55927 others¦55929:
\v 10 “\wj Once two men¦55936 went¦55938 into the temple¦55941 to pray—one was a Pharisee¦55945 party¦55945 member¦55945 and¦55946 the other¦55948 was a tax-collector.\wj*

\v 38 as an inscription¦61421 had been placed above him¦61425 that said, “This is the king¦61436 of the Jews¦61438.”
\p
\v 39 One of the criminals¦61445 that was hanging there insulted him¦61447, saying¦61448, “Aren't you¦61451 the \nd messiah¦61454\nd*? Save yourself¦61458 and¦61459 us \add too\add*.”
\p
\v 40 But the other¦61464 \add criminal\add* told him¦61467 off, saying¦61468, “Don't you even respect \nd God¦61476\nd* when you \add too have been sentenced to death.\add*
\v 41 At least we deserve our punishment that fits what we've done, but in contrast, this \add man\add* did nothing wrong.”
\v 42 Then he said, “\nd Yeshua¦61512\nd*, remember me when you enter your¦61528 kingdom¦61527.”
\p
\v 43 “\wj I can assure you,\wj*” he replied, “\wj that you'll be with me in paradise¦61552 today¦61545.\wj*”

\v 47 When the centurion¦61625 saw how it happened, he praised \nd God¦61633\nd* saying¦61634, “This really was an innocent man¦61640.”

\v 50 Then, look, there was a man named Yosef on the local council¦61696. (He was a good man and godly,
\v 51 and hadn't agreed with what the council had decided and done. He was from the Jewish city¦61718 of Arimathea¦61716 and was waiting¦61725 for God's kingdom¦61729 \add to come\add*.)
\v 52 He went in to see Pilate¦61736 and requested¦61737 \nd Yeshua's¦61741\nd* body¦61739,
\v 53 then he¦61745 took it down \add from the stake\add* and wrapped¦61745 it in some linen¦61752 cloth¦61752 and put the body into a \add new\add* tomb¦61759 hollowed into the rock¦61760 that hadn't been used yet.
\v 54 It was now the day of preparation¦61789 and the Rest Day was about to begin.
\p
\v 55 The women¦61802 who'd come¦61805 from Galilee¦61810 followed¦61796 \add Yosef and his¦61823 men\add* and saw¦61814 the tomb¦61817 and how the body¦61822 was placed inside,

\v 1 but as soon as it dawned on Sunday morning, they went back to the tomb¦61851 taking the prepared¦61857 spices¦61858.
\v 2 There they¦61874 discovered that the stone¦61878 had been rolled¦61879 away from the entrance
\v 3 and when they¦61888 went in, the body¦61890 of the \nd master¦61892 Yeshua¦61893\nd* wasn't there.
\v 4 While they were still there puzzling about¦61902 what might have happened, two¦61909 men¦61908 in dazzling clothes¦61914 approached¦61911 them.
\v 5 The women were scared, \add and knelt down\add* and bowed with their¦61928 faces¦61930 close to the ground¦61935, but the men asked them, “Why are you¦61944 looking¦61944 for¦61944 the living¦61946 in the \add place of\add* the dead¦61949?
\v 6 \x + \xo 24:6-7: \xt Mrk 8:31; 9:31; 10:33-34; Mat 16:21; 17:22-23; 20:18-19; Luk 9:22; 18:31-33.\x*He's not here—he's been brought back to life. Remember how he spoke¦61960 to you all when you were still¦61962 in Galilee¦61967
\v 7 and he said, ‘\wj It's necessary¦61976 that humanity's child is handed over to sinful¦61981 people¦61980 and to be executed¦61983 on a stake¦61983, and then to \add come back to life\add* on the third¦61986 day¦61987.’\wj* ”
\v 8 Then indeed they¦61990 remembered his¦61993 words.
\p
\v 9 Then they¦61999 left the tomb¦61998 and went back \add into the city\add* and reported¦61999 all this to the eleven¦62004 apprentices and all the others.
\v 10 (The women who told this to the missionaries were Maria from Magdala¦62013, Yoanna, Maria the mother¦62020 of Yacob¦62021, and the other women who were with them.)
\v 11 However those who heard it, thought it was all just nonsense¦62040 and¦62045 didn't believe them.
\v 12 But Peter stood up and ran¦62052 off to the tomb¦62055, and when he stooped¦62057 down \add to look in\add*, he could only see the linen¦62060 cloths¦62060, so he wandered off by himself¦62068, wondering¦62069 what could have happened.

\p
\v 13 Then, wow, two¦62076 of \add Yeshua's followers\add* were \add walking\add* to the village¦62092 of Emmaus about eleven kilometres away from Yerusalem¦62098
\v 14 and they¦62105 were discussing with each other about¦62113 all the recent events.
\v 15 After a while talking and debating¦62125, \nd Yeshua¦62130\nd* \add caught up with\add* them and joined them,
\v 16 but their¦62138 eyes¦62137 were restricted¦62139 from being¦62139 able to recognise him¦62143.
\v 17 He asked them, “\wj What's¦62150 all this that you two are talking about while you walk¦62159?\wj*”
\p They stopped \add suddenly\add* and looked at him with sad faces
\v 18 and the one called Cleopas asked him¦62174, “Are you the only visitor staying in Yerusalem¦62180 who doesn't know what just happened in the last few days¦62192?”
\p
\v 19 “\wj What happened?\wj*” he asked.
\p “What happened to the man¦62216, \nd Yeshua¦62210\nd* from Nazareth¦62212,” they responded. “He was a prophet¦62217 who did powerful miracles and delivered a powerful message¦62224 in front of \nd God¦62229\nd* and all the people¦62233.
\v 20 The chief¦62242 priests¦62242 and our¦62246 rulers¦62245 handed him over to be sentenced to death¦62249, and he was executed¦62251 on a stake¦62251.
\v 21 We were hoping¦62255 that he was going¦62264 to be the one who would release Israel \add from the grip of the Romans\add*, but all that happened three days ago now.
\v 22 Then some of our women¦62287 also surprised us, because they went to his tomb¦62299 \add very\add* early¦62295 \add this morning\add*
\v 23 and couldn't find his¦62305 body¦62304, Then they came¦62307 back and told us about some vision¦62310 about messengers¦62311 \add from God\add* who apparently said that he's alive.
\v 24 Some of our companions went¦62318 out to the tomb¦62327 and found¦62329 it¦62329 just as the women¦62336 had said¦62337, but they didn't see \add anyone\add*.”
\p
\v 25 “\wj Oh, you're so foolish¦62352,\wj*” he told them, “\wj and your hearts¦62356 are so reluctant to believe¦62358 everything that the prophets¦62364 wrote.\wj*
\v 26 \wj Didn't the \nd messiah¦62371\nd* need to suffer¦62369 all of that in order to be able to enter into all his¦62378 greatness?\wj*”
\v 27 Then starting with Moses and going through all the prophets¦62388, he explained the scriptures¦62403 to them concerning¦62405 what had been written about him there.
\p
\v 28 As they got close to the village¦62413 they were going to, he seemed¦62419 to be going on further
\v 29 but they¦62424 urged¦62424 him¦62425, “Come and stay with us because¦62430 it's almost evening¦62432 and there's not much daylight left.”
\v 30 Then when they were already ready to eat, he picked up the bread¦62461 and blessed¦62462 it, and then he broke¦62465 it and handed it out to them,
\v 31 and then their eyes¦62484 were opened¦62481 and they recognised¦62487 him. Just then he vanished¦62491,
\v 32 and they said¦62498 to each other, “Weren't our¦62506 hearts¦62505 burning when he was speaking¦62514 to us on the road¦62519 and explaining the scriptures¦62527 to us?”
\p
\v 33 That very hour¦62533 they \add packed up and\add* headed back to Yerusalem¦62536 where they found¦62538 that the eleven¦62542 and the others with them had gathered¦62539 together
\v 34 saying¦62547, “The \nd master¦62553\nd* really¦62550 has come back to life—he was seen¦62556 by Simon¦62558 \add Peter\add*!”

\v 36 As they were still talking¦62580 about these¦62577 things¦62577, Yeshua himself¦62582 \add suddenly\add* was there standing in the room and¦62590 told them, “\wj Peace¦62597 to you¦62598 all.\wj*”
\p
\v 37 However, they¦62608 got a fright¦62606 and¦62605 then were terrified¦62600 thinking¦62608 that it was a spirit¦62610.
\v 38 Then he spoke to them \add again\add*, “\wj Why are you all upset, and why are you thinking such stuff?\wj*
\v 39 \wj Look at my¦62637 hands¦62635 and feet¦62641 and you'll see that it's me. Touch¦62650 me and look, because¦62654 spirits¦62656 don't¦62663 have solid bodies like you can see that I have.\wj*”
\p
\v 40 Then he¦62676 showed¦62676 them his hands¦62680 and¦62681 his feet¦62683.
\v 41 Some of them, still¦62684 not believing, had a mixture of happiness and doubt, and he asked them, “\wj Have you got anything here to eat?\wj*”
\v 42 They handed¦62707 him¦62708 a piece of broiled¦62710 fish¦62709,
\v 43 and he¦62721 took it and ate¦62721 it in front of them.
\p
\v 44 Then he told them, “\wj While I was still¦62736 with you all I told you those messages¦62730 of mine, and how that everything written¦62750 about me by Moses and the prophets¦62758 and in the songs¦62760, it's all going to be fulfilled¦62746.\wj*”
\v 45 Then he opened¦62765 their¦62766 minds to be able to understand¦62770 the scriptures¦62773, and he told them,
\v 46 “\wj It was written¦62779 that the \nd messiah¦62785\nd* would suffer¦62783 and¦62787 to come back to life on the third¦62792 day¦62793,\wj*
\v 47 \wj and¦62794 that his¦62800 name¦62799 will be proclaimed¦62795 \add as the authority\add* to forgive¦62804 the sins¦62805 \add of the people\add* when they repent¦62801—\add people\add* from every country beginning \add here\add* in Yerusalem¦62816.\wj*
