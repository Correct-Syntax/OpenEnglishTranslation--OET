\mt2 being the account of Yeshua's ministry
\is1 Introduction
\is2 Author
\ip This account about the works and teachings of Yeshua was written by Luke, one of the later followers of Yeshua. Luke was believed to be a medical doctor and although many have assumed him to be a Greek, there's also a good case that he was Jewish. He was good friends with Paul and accompanied him several times as they travelled to various places to spread the good news about Yeshua the messiah. Luke was also the author of the account of the beginnings of the Christian church known commonly known as \bk Acts\bk*, and unlike most other Bibles, the \em Open English Translation\em* places these two successive accounts one after the other.
\is2 This account
\ip This account was written to Theophilus who is said to be an honoured person from Rome. He starts his account with the prophecied birth of Yohan-the-Immerser and then of Yeshua right through until he's lifted into the clouds. Luke also explains how that Yeshua is the messiah promised by God to save Jews and all non-Jews who put their trust in him.
\ip It's also told here in this document about Yeshua's mercy towards troubled people and sinners, his healing din of many who were sick or possessed by demons, his bringing dead people back to life, and his teaching. Recurring themes here include God's spirit, prayer, forgiveness of sins, the women who helped Yeshua with his work, and how believers should prepare for his return.

\s1 Introduction
\p
\v 1 Several people attempted¦37628 to write an account about the events that we're personally certain of
\v 2 as the ones who were eyewitnesses¦37646 and¦37647 hearers of these accounts from the beginning¦37645 handed them over to us.
\v 3 So since we had followed¦37655 all these events so carefully, it¦37653 seemed like a good idea to write¦37661 this account for you¦37660, honoured Theophilus¦37663,
\v 4 so that you could know¦37665 the definite background behind what you were taught.
\s1 The messenger foretells the birth of Yohan-the-Immerser
\p
\v 5 \x + \xo 1:5: \xt 1Ch 24:10.\x*It started with the priest¦37682 Zechariah and his wife¦37691 Elizabeth at the time when Herod¦37677 was the king¦37679 of Yudea¦37681. (Zechariah was in the priestly division¦37687 of Abijah¦37688, and Elizabeth was also a descendant of Aaron.)
\v 6 God¦37711 considered them both good and blameless¦37721 as they¦37704 obeyed his commandments¦37716 and regulations.
\v 7 Elizabeth¦37730 had never been able to have a child¦37726, so there was just the two of them as they were now getting older.
\p
\v 8 One time¦37745 as he was taking his rostered turn to serve God¦37757 along with his division¦37752,
\v 9 he was chosen¦37763 by lot (this was how the priests¦37762 assigned tasks) to light the incense¦37766 in the temple¦37770, and so he proceeded inside.
\v 10 A lot of people¦37780 would be praying¦37782 outside¦37783 the temple at the time when the incense¦37787 was burnt.
\v 11 At that moment, a messenger from God appeared to Zechariah, standing right there at the right of the incense¦37799 altar¦37797.
\v 12 Zechariah¦37802 got a big fright at seeing him there and started to tremble.
\v 13 But the messenger spoke, “Don't be scared Zechariah, because¦37820 your request has been listened¦37821 to, and your wife¦37827 Elizabeth will give birth to a son and you'll name¦37838 him Yohan¦37840.
\v 14 He'll bring a lot of happiness to you and you'll be proud of him¦37854—in fact many people will be glad.
\v 15 \x + \xo 1:15: \xt Num 6:3.\x*He'll be considered special in God's eyes, but he won't be allowed to drink¦37870 wine or spirits. Even while he's still¦37875 in his¦37881 mother's¦37880 womb, he'll be filled¦37874 with God's spirit¦37872.
\v 16 He will turn many children of Israel back to Yahweh, their¦37892 God¦37891.
\v 17 \x + \xo 1:17: \xt Mal 4:5-6.\x*And he will go on ahead¦37896 of God with the spirit¦37900 and the power¦37902 of Elijah, to turn fathers¦37907 back to loving their children¦37909 and to turn career criminals towards the wisdom of godly people, to get the people ready for the master¦37917.”
\p
\v 18 Zechariah asked the messenger, “How will I know if this is true. Because¦37931 I'm an older¦37933 man¦37933 and¦37934 my¦37937 wife¦37936 is also getting old.”
\p
\v 19 \x + \xo 1:19: \xt Dan 8:16; 9:21.\x*Now the messenger rebuked him¦37948, “I am Gabriel¦37951 who stood¦37953 right in front of God¦37957 and was commanded to come here and talk to you, and to tell all of this to you.
\v 20 So hear this: Because you didn't believe¦37984 my¦37987 message¦37986, you will be made silent¦37970 and unable to speak¦37974 until¦37975 the day¦37977 that all of these¦37980 things¦37980 happen, and they certainly will happen at the proper times.”
\p
\v 21 Meanwhile, the people¦37998 outside were expecting¦38000 Zechariah to come back out, and¦38003 were wondering what could be holding him¦38009 up there inside the temple¦38012.
\v 22 But when he did emerge, he wasn't able to speak¦38019 to them. They wondering if maybe he'd seen¦38025 a vision¦38024 in the temple¦38028, and he nodded to confirm this although he remained mute.
\v 23 And after he'd finished his¦38046 rostered days¦38043 in the temple, he returned home¦38051.
\p
\v 24 As time went on, Elizabeth became pregnant and¦38066 secluded¦38067 herself¦38068 away for five¦38070 months¦38069, saying¦38071,
\v 25 “The master¦38077\f + \fr 1:25 \ft Clearly referring to \em Yahweh\em*. By this time in history, as a sign of respect the Jewish people had stopped saying God's name aloud.\f* has done this for me. At this time he's looked¦38081 down at me and taken away the public shame of my¦38085 being childless.”
\s1 God's messenger comes to Maria
\p
\v 26 When Elizabeth was six months¦38091 pregnant, God¦38102 sent¦38095 his messenger Gabriel¦38098 to Nazareth¦38111, a city¦38104 in the Galilee¦38107 region.
\v 27 \x + \xo 1:27: \xt Mat 1:18.\x*Gabriel went to a young woman named Maria¦38131 who was engaged to be married to Yosef¦38120, a descendant of \add King\add* David¦38125,
\v 28 and entering the room, spoke to her¦38138, “Hello there. The master¦38145 is with you and he's chosen you to be honoured.”
\v 29 Maria was very puzzled by the statement¦38159 and¦38163 wondered what kind of greeting¦38171 it could be
\v 30 as the messenger continued, “Don't be scared, Maria¦38183, because¦38186 you¦38185 have found¦38185 God's favour¦38187
\v 31 \x + \xo 1:31: \xt Mat 1:21.\x*and listen, you will conceive¦38193 a baby and go on to give birth to a son, and you should name¦38202 him¦38203 Yeshua¦38204.
\v 32 \x + \xo 1:32-33: \xt 2Sam 7:12-13,16; Isa 9:7.\x*He will be very special and will be called¦38212 the son of the highest¦38211 one, and God¦38219 the master¦38217 will give him the throne¦38221 of David¦38222, his¦38225 ancestor.
\v 33 He will reign¦38227 over Yacob's¦38231 descendants throughout the ages, and his¦38238 kingdom¦38237 will never end¦38241.”
\p
\v 34 “How would this work,” Maria¦38245 asked the messenger, “because¦38254 I've never slept with a guy?”
\p
\v 35 “The pure¦38267 spirit¦38266 will come over you,” answered¦38261 the messenger, “and the power¦38272 of the highest¦38273 one will overshadow¦38274 you, and so the holy child¦38283 that will be born will be called¦38284 God's son.
\v 36 Also, your¦38293 relative¦38291 Elizabeth has also conceived¦38297 a son in her¦38302 old age—the one who was called¦38311 barren¦38312 is now six months¦38306 pregnant
\v 37 \x + \xo 1:37: \xt Gen 18:14.\x*because with God¦38321, his statements always come to pass.”
\p
\v 38 “Look here,” said Maria¦38328, “I'm the master's¦38333 servant girl. May everything you said come¦38334 true.” Then the messenger left her.
\s1 Maria's visit to Elizabeth
\p
\v 39 Several days¦38356 later, Mariya determined that she'd go to the town in the hills of Yudea
\v 40 where Zechariah and Elizabeth lived. She entered the house¦38372 and greeted¦38375 Elizabeth,
\v 41 and as soon as Elizabeth heard¦38381 the greeting¦38385, her baby in her womb kicked¦38390, and she was filled¦38404 with the pure¦38406 spirit¦38405
\v 42 and she¦38411 called out loudly¦38414, “Out of \add all\add* women¦38420, you¦38427 have been blessed and the baby in your¦38427 womb has been blessed.
\v 43 How could this happen to me—that the mother¦38435 of my¦38438 master¦38437 would come¦38433 and visit me!
\v 44 You see¦38442, as soon as I heard your¦38450 greeting¦38449, the baby in my¦38454 womb kicked¦38455 with excitement,
\v 45 and the woman¦38470 who believed¦38471 that everything the master¦38479 told her¦38477 will happen, she will be blessed¦38469.”
\s1 Maria's song of praise
\p
\v 46 Maria¦38482 said¦38481,
\q1 “My¦38487 soul¦38486 praises the master¦38489,
\q1
\v 47 and¦38490 my spirit¦38493 is so happy about God¦38498, my saviour¦38500,
\q1
\v 48 \x + \xo 1:48: \xt 1Sam 1:11.\x*because he noticed his¦38510 humble servant girl.
\q1 Look now, all the future generations¦38520 will consider that I was blessed¦38516
\q1
\v 49 because the powerful¦38529 one treated me incredibly,
\q1 and¦38530 his¦38535 name¦38534 is holy.
\q1
\v 50 He shows his¦38539 mercy¦38538 to multiple generations;
\q1 to those who honour him.
\q1
\v 51 His¦38554 arm is powerful¦38551;
\q1 he scatters¦38555 those who are proud¦38556 in their¦38559 hearts¦38558.
\q1
\v 52 \x + \xo 1:52: \xt Job 5:11; 12:19.\x*He knocks kings off their thrones¦38563,
\q1 and¦38564 praises those who're humble¦38566.
\q1
\v 53 Those who're hungry, he fills with good¦38569 things¦38569,
\q1 but those who're rich, he sends away empty¦38573 handed.
\q1
\v 54 He took¦38574 good care of his¦38577 servant¦38576, Israel,
\q1 to be reminded¦38578 of mercy¦38579
\q1
\v 55 \x + \xo 1:55: \xt Gen 17:7.\x*as he spoke¦38581 to our¦38585 ancestors¦38584,
\q1 to Abraham¦38587 and his¦38591 descendants¦38590,
\q1 at the right time.”
\p
\v 56 So Maria¦38599 stayed with Elizabeth for about¦38603 three¦38606 months¦38605 before returning¦38608 back to her¦38612 own home¦38611.
\s1 The birth of Yohan-the-Immerser
\p
\v 57 When Elizabeth's nine months were up, she¦38623 gave birth and¦38622 produced a son
\v 58 and her neighbours¦38628 and relatives¦38631 heard¦38626 that the master¦38636 had shown great mercy¦38638 to her, and so they celebrated along with her.
\p
\v 59 \x + \xo 1:59: \xt Lev 12:3.\x*When the baby boy was eight¦38652 days old, it was the time to circumcise¦38655 him, and \add the relatives at the ceremony\add* started calling¦38659 him Zacharias after¦38661 the name¦38663 of his¦38666 father¦38665,
\v 60 but¦38675 the baby's mother¦38671 spoke up and said¦38673, “No, he's going to be named Yohan¦38680.”
\p
\v 61 “None of your¦38695 relatives¦38693 have that name¦38700,” they¦38683 said¦38683
\v 62 and they signalled¦38704 to the father¦38707 to tell them what name¦38709 he wanted for the baby.
\p
\v 63 So Zacharias requested¦38719 a writing tablet¦38721 and wrote¦38722, “His¦38729 name¦38728 is Yohan¦38724.” Everyone was amazed
\v 64 and then suddenly his¦38745 mouth¦38744 and tongue¦38749 were freed and he was able to speak¦38752 again and started praising God¦38755.
\v 65 Everyone¦38774 who lived nearby was a bit unnerved by all this, and¦38768 the story about what happened was discussed¦38777 \add in all the homes\add* around¦38765 the hills
\v 66 and¦38805 those who heard¦38787 about it were thinking to themselves, “Who's this young child¦38800 going to turn out to be?”
\s1 Zacharias' prophecy about Yohan
\p
\v 67 Then the boy's father¦38813, Zacharias, became filled¦38815 with the pure¦38817 spirit¦38816 and¦38818 prophesied¦38819,
\q1
\v 68 “Blessed¦38823 is the master¦38824, the god¦38826 of Israel¦38828,
\q1 because¦38829 he visited¦38830 us and made a way for his¦38839 people¦38837 to be freed from slavery.
\q1
\v 69 He¦38848 brought us a voice that would lead to our salvation¦38843,
\q1 us citizens of \add the nation of King\add* David¦38848, his¦38851 servant¦38850
\q1
\v 70 (as he spoke¦38853 via the mouths¦38855 of his¦38864 holy prophets¦38863 through the age\add s\add*).
\q1
\v 71 He saved us from our¦38870 enemies¦38869,
\q1 and from the power of all the ones hating¦38876 us,
\q1
\v 72 to show mercy¦38879 to our¦38883 ancestors¦38882
\q1 and¦38884 to remind¦38885 them of his¦38888 holy agreement,
\q1
\v 73 that he had promised Abraham¦38893, our¦38896 ancestor, that he would give¦38898 us.
\q1
\v 74 He rescued¦38906 us from the power of our¦38904 enemies¦38904,
\q1 so we could serve him¦38908 without fear,
\q1
\v 75 committed to obeying him¦38914
\q1 for the rest of our¦38923 lives.
\q1
\v 76 \x + \xo 1:76: \xt Mal 3:1.\x*And you too my little¦38927 child¦38927, will be called¦38930 a prophet¦38928 of the highest¦38929 one—
\q1 going¦38931 before the master¦38937 to prepare¦38938 his¦38940 paths,
\q1
\v 77 to give¦38942 knowledge¦38943 about salvation¦38944 to his¦38947 people¦38946
\q1 so their¦38952 sins¦38950 can be forgiven¦38949
\q1
\v 78 because¦38954 God¦38957 has compassion¦38955 on us and mercy¦38956.
\q1 Thus the light from heaven will visit¦38962 us
\q1
\v 79 \x + \xo 1:79: \xt Isa 9:2.\x*to shine¦38967 on those in darkness¦38971 and¦38972 sitting¦38975 in the shadow¦38973 of death¦38974;
\q1 to guide us onto the road of peace¦38983.”
\p
\v 80 The young boy grew and his spirit¦38990 was also strengthened¦38989, and he lived in the wilderness¦38995 until¦38996 he started his ministry to \add the people of\add* Israel.
\c 2
\s1 Yeshua's birth in Bethlehem
\r (Mat. 1:18-25)
\p
\v 1 At that time, Caesar Augustus¦39013 sent a decree¦39010 that everyone throughout the empire needed to register¦39015 \add in a census\add*.
\v 2 (This census was conducted when Quirinius was the governor¦39028 of Syria.)
\v 3 Everyone had to \add officially\add* register¦39037 in the city¦39046 of their \add birth\add*.
\p
\v 4 Because Yosef was a descendant of \add King\add* David, he left the town of Nazareth¦39056 in the Galilee¦39053 \add region\add* and went¦39047 down to David's town of Bethlehem¦39068 in Yudea
\v 5 to register¦39078 along with Maria¦39081, his pregnant¦39090 fiancée.
\v 6 While they were in Bethlehem, the time¦39105 came¦39100 for her¦39115 to give birth
\v 7 and so Maria bore her¦39120 first¦39122 son and wrapped him in strips of cloth and slept him in an \add empty\add* feeding trough, because¦39133 they had missed out on the guest¦39140 room¦39137.
\s1 The shepherds and the messengers
\p
\v 8 In that same¦39150 area, there were some shepherds¦39142 staying out in the fields¦39152 where they kept watch¦39156 over their¦39162 flocks¦39161 at night¦39158.
\v 9 A messenger sent by the master approached¦39167 them, and the master's radiance shone around¦39173 them, and they were very frightened.
\v 10 “Don't be scared,” the messenger told them, “because¦39190 I'm bringing you¦39192 a good¦39191 message¦39191 that will bring great¦39194 happiness to all people¦39201
\v 11 because¦39202 a saviour¦39206 for all people was born today¦39205 in David's town. He's the messiah¦39209—the master¦39210—
\v 12 and this is how you'll know him: you'll find a baby wrapped in strips of cloth and sleeping in a feeding trough.”
\p
\v 13 Then suddenly¦39232 lots of heavenly¦39239 soldiers joined the messenger, praising¦39241 God¦39244 and¦39245 saying¦39246,
\v 14 “Let all honour be given to God¦39250 in the highest¦39249, and¦39251 peace¦39254 on earth¦39253 to all people along with good¦39259 will.”
\p
\v 15 Then as the messengers left them and¦39287 went¦39263 \add up\add* into the sky, the shepherds¦39277 said to each other, “Well, we'll certainly go into Bethlehem¦39286 so we can see¦39288 what this was about that Yahweh¦39296 has let us know about.”
\p
\v 16 So they hurried¦39302 \add into town\add* and asked around to find Maria¦39310 and Yosef, and \add also\add* the baby sleeping in the feeding trough.
\v 17 When they met them, the explained what they had been told about the young baby.
\v 18 Everyone who heard¦39338 this was amazed at what the shepherds¦39347 told them,
\v 19 but Maria¦39353 treasured¦39355 all of these¦39359 messages¦39358 in her¦39365 heart¦39363 and \add often\add* thought about them.
\v 20 Finally the shepherds¦39370 returned¦39368 \add back to their fields\add*—they were worshipping and praising¦39373 God¦39375 for what they'd heard¦39379 and how they'd seen it exactly like they'd been told.
\s1 The child is named Yeshua
\p
\v 21 \x + \xo 2:21: a \xt Lev 12:3; \xo b \xt Luk 1:31.\x*When the baby was eight¦39393 days¦39391 old and hence the time¦39413 for his¦39404 circumcision¦39395, he was given the name¦39403 Yeshua¦39405 as instructed by \add God's\add* messenger even before¦39412 he was conceived¦39414 in the womb.
\s1 Yeshua is dedicated in the temple
\p
\v 22 Then when the time of the \add mother's\add* purifcation¦39427 was fulfilled¦39423 as per Moses' instructions, they¦39435 took him¦39436 down to Jerusalem¦39438 to be dedicated to Yahweh
\v 23 \x + \xo 2:23: \xt Exo 13:2,12.\x*to follow what is written¦39444 in Yahweh's law: Every¦39450 firstborn male¦39451 is set aside for Yahweh
\v 24 \x + \xo 2:22-24: \xt Lev 12:6-8.\x*and¦39459 hence a sacrifice¦39462 has to be made, which according¦39463 to that law is a pair of turtledoves¦39471 or young¦39474 doves¦39476.
\p
\v 25 Now listen, there was a man named Simeon in Yerusalem and he was godly¦39495 and committed, waiting¦39496 for God to rescue Israel. He was \add full\add* of the pure¦39504 spirit¦39501
\v 26 and the spirit¦39516 had told him that he wouldn't die without seeing Yahweh's messiah¦39528.
\v 27 He had come to the temple¦39537 listening to the spirit¦39534 at just the same time¦39540 as the parents brought in the baby Yeshua¦39547 in order to follow the rituals for new parents.
\v 28 Simeon took the baby into his arms and blessed¦39569 God¦39572 and said¦39574,
\v 29 “Now, Yahweh, you can send your¦39579 slave¦39578 away in peace¦39586 as you promised
\v 30 because¦39587 I've set my¦39591 eyes¦39590 on your¦39594 salvation¦39593
\v 31 which¦39595 you¦39596 have prepared¦39596 in front of everyone:
\v 32 \x + \xo 2:32: \xt Isa 42:6; 49:6; 52:10.\x*a light¦39602 so the non-Jews¦39605 can understand, and the greatest gift from and for your¦39609 people¦39608 of Israel¦39610.”
\p
\v 33 The baby's parents were amazed¦39622 at the things¦39624 being¦39625 spoken¦39625 about him,
\v 34 and Simeon blessed¦39629 them and said¦39634 to Maria¦39636, “Listen, this boy has been chosen to cause both the rise and the fall of many people in Israel, and \add sent as\add* a sign¦39654 but one which many people will oppose.
\v 35 Also even as you¦39657 experience incredible grief in the future, it will allow the thoughts of many hearts¦39670 to be revealed¦39666.”
\p
\v 36 Also there was a prophetess¦39676 named Hanna¦39675 (the daughter¦39677 of Phanuel from the tribe¦39680 of Asher). She was very elderly, having been married for seven¦39695 years¦39694,
\v 37 and then had been widowed¦39703 for eighty-four¦39708 years¦39706. She was always at the temple¦39718, serving¦39726 night¦39727 and day¦39729 in prayer and fasting¦39719.
\v 38 She also approached¦39736 the baby around the same¦39733 time, and praised¦39737 God and spoke about the boy to everyone in Yerusalem who was waiting¦39747 for God to free them.
\s1 Their return home to Nazareth
\p
\v 39 \x + \xo 2:39: \xt Mat 2:23.\x*When they had done all the rituals according¦39758 to Yahweh's instructions, they returned¦39762 to their home town of Nazareth¦39773 up in Galilee¦39767.
\v 40 The young boy grew and got stronger, and started showing amazing wisdom¦39795 and it was clear that God¦39798 was blessing him¦39802.
\s1 Young Yeshua is found in the temple
\p
\v 41 \x + \xo 2:41: \xt Exo 12:1-27; Deu 16:1-8.\x*Every year¦39813 Yeshua's family would go down to Jerusalem¦39815 for the Passover celebrations.
\v 42 One time when he was twelve¦39829 years¦39826 old, they went to celebrate the Passover there as usual,
\v 43 and when it was all over and they started on their return¦39857, the lad stayed there in Jerusalem¦39866 but his¦39877 parents¦39875 weren't aware of it.
\v 44 They thought¦39879 he was with others in the group, but at the end of the day's hiking when they looked for him among¦39894 the relatives¦39896 and acquaintances¦39901,
\v 45 they couldn't find him, so they returned¦39907 to Jerusalem¦39909 to look for him.
\v 46 It was only after¦39915 three¦39917 days¦39916 that they¦39918 found¦39918 him¦39919 in the temple¦39923, sitting¦39924 with the \add religious\add* teachers¦39928 there—sometimes listening to them, and¦39932 sometimes asking¦39933 them questions.
\v 47 Everyone who heard the conversations were amazed¦39936 and his¦39948 intelligence¦39944 and knowledge.
\v 48 When his parents found him, they were astonished¦39952 and his mother¦39958 asked, “Son, how could you do this to us? Your¦39971 father¦39970 and I have been frantic looking¦39980 for¦39980 you!”
\p
\v 49 “Why did you all need to look for me?” he answered. “Didn't you both know that it's good for me to be in my¦39999 father's¦39998 house¦39996?”
\v 50 But they didn't really understand¦40008 what he meant.
\p
\v 51 After that, he went back to Nazareth¦40021 with them and continued to be obedient to them,
\v 52 \x + \xo 2:52: \xt 1Sam 2:26; Prv 3:4.\x*and so Yeshua¦40045 continued to grow wiser and taller, and in favour¦40055 with both God¦40057 and the people¦40061.

\s1 Yohan-the-Immerser's preaching
\r (Mat. 3:1-12; Mrk. 1:1-8; Jn 1:19-28)
\p
\v 1 It was the fifteenth¦40065 year of the rule of Caesar Tiberius¦40069 when Pontius¦40073 Pilate¦40074 was the governor¦40068 of Yudea and Herod¦40082 was the ruler of the Galilean¦40081 quarter. His¦40087 brother¦40086 Philip was the ruler of the Iturean quarter and of the region¦40099 of Traconitis, and Lysanias was the ruler of the Abilene quarter.
\v 2 Annas¦40108 and Caiaphas were the high priests¦40106 \add in Yerusalem\add*, and this was the time when Yohan (son of Zechariah) began preaching God's message¦40113 in the wilderness¦40123.
\v 3 He went around all the areas surrounding¦40129 the Yordan¦40131 \add River\add*, telling \add the people\add* that they could get immersed¦40133 \add in water\add* as a sign they were turning away from disobeying God and requesting forgiveness¦40136
\v 4 \x + \xo 3:4-6: \xt Isa 40:3-5 (LXX).\x*just like the prophet¦40147 Isaiah had written¦40140:
\q1 ‘The voice¦40149 shouting¦40150 in the wilderness¦40153
\q1 prepare Yahweh's road,
\q1 make his¦40164 paths¦40162 straight¦40159.
\q1
\v 5 Every¦40165 valley¦40166 will be filled¦40167 up,
\q1 and every¦40169 mountain¦40170 and hill will be levelled off.
\q1 What's crooked¦40177 will be made straight¦40179,
\q1 and the rough¦40184 roads will be made smooth¦40187.
\q1
\v 6 and¦40188 everybody will see God's salvation¦40193.’
\p
\v 7 \x + \xo 3:7: \xt Mat 12:34; 23:33.\x*Because of that, he was telling the crowds¦40203 that went out there to be immersed¦40204 by him, “Bunch of snakes! Who warned¦40211 you all to flee from the severe¦40218 anger¦40218 that's coming¦40217?
\v 8 \x + \xo 3:8: \xt Jn 8:33.\x*So then start demonstrating the qualities that show you have actually turned from your disobedience. And don't¦40229 start by telling me that you're descendants of Abraham¦40253, because¦40240 I can tell you all that God¦40245 could make descendants out of these¦40249 stones¦40248 here.
\v 9 \x + \xo 3:9: \xt Mat 7:19.\x*The axe¦40258 is already¦40254 sitting at the base of the trees¦40263, so that every¦40265 tree¦40267 that doesn't produce¦40269 good¦40272 fruit¦40270 will be chopped down and¦40275 thrown¦40278 into the fire¦40277.”
\p
\v 10 “What should we¦40288 do then,” the crowds¦40284 asked him¦40282.
\p
\v 11 “If you've got two¦40300 jackets, give one to someone who doesn't have one,” he replied, “and similarly if you've got food.”
\p
\v 12 \x + \xo 3:12: \xt Luk 7:29.\x*Even some tax-collectors came¦40312 to be immersed¦40318, and¦40321 they¦40322 asked Yohan, “Teacher¦40326, what should we¦40328 do?”
\p
\v 13 “Don't collect any extra on top of what you've been told to collect,” he said¦40334.
\p
\v 14 “And what about us too,” some soldiers¦40352 inquired.
\p “Don't bully people or falsely¦40374 accuse¦40374 anyone,” Yohan answered, “and¦40375 be content with your¦40379 wages¦40378.”
\p
\v 15 The people¦40383 were expecting¦40380 that the messiah¦40399 might¦40397 come \add to save them\add* and¦40384 started wondering in their¦40391 minds if maybe it was Yohan
\v 16 but he explained to them all, “I've been immersing you all in water¦40414, but there's one coming¦40422 who's greater than me, in fact I'm not even worthy¦40433 to unlace his¦40441 sandals¦40439. He will immerse you all with the pure¦40447 spirit¦40446 and with fire¦40449.
\v 17 He'll hold the winnowing¦40452 fork so he can clear¦40459 out the threshing¦40461 floor¦40461, gathering¦40466 the wheat¦40469 into his¦40456 barn and burning¦40479 up the chaff¦40477 with a fire¦40480 that never goes out.”
\p
\v 18 Yohan preached¦40489 the good¦40489 message¦40489 to the people¦40492 and also encouraged them to change for the better.
\v 19 \x + \xo 3:19-20: \xt Mat 14:3-4; Mrk 6:17-18.\x*But Herod¦40495 who was the ruler¦40497 of the \add Galilean\add* quarter¦40497 had been scolded by Yohan about taking his¦40508 brother¦40507 Philip's wife¦40504 Herodias, and¦40509 about many other evil¦40516 things that he'd done,
\v 20 added¦40519 to his evils when he¦40525 locked¦40525 Yohan¦40528 up in prison¦40531.
\s1 Yeshua's double baptism
\r (Mat. 3:13-17; Mrk. 1:9-11)
\p
\v 21 One day along with all the other people¦40540 being immersed, Yeshua¦40542 had come and been immersed, and while he prayed¦40546, the sky opened¦40547 up
\v 22 \x + \xo 3:22: \xt Gen 22:2; Psa 2:7; Isa 42:1; Mat 3:17; Mrk 1:11; Luk 9:35.\x*and the pure¦40556 spirit¦40554 came down onto him¦40565 in the bodily¦40557 form of a dove¦40562, and a voice¦40567 came from the sky, “You are my¦40577 son that I love and take pleasure¦40586 in.”
\s1 Yeshua's ancestry back to God

\p
\v 23 Yeshua¦40595 was about¦40597 thirty¦40600 when he started \add his ministry\add*. He was the son (as it was thought¦40605) of Yosef, son of Heli,

\s1 Yeshua is tested by the devil
\r (Mat. 4:1-11; Mrk. 1:12-13)
\p
\v 1 Then Yeshua¦40810, full of the pure¦40814 spirit, returned¦40816 from the Yordan¦40819 region and was led into the wilderness¦40830 by the spirit
\v 2 where he was tested by the devil¦40838 for forty¦40833 days. He didn't eat anything during that time, and was hungry at the end.
\p
\v 3 So the devil¦40857 told him¦40855, “If you're¦40860 God's son, just turn this stone¦40867 into bread¦40873.”
\p
\v 4 \x + \xo 4:4: \xt Deu 8:3.\x*“\wj It's been written¦40888,\wj*” Yeshua¦40883 replied, “\wj that people don't live just on food.\wj*”
\p
\v 5 Then the devil brought¦40904 him up \add to a high point\add* and in just a moment¦40923 of time¦40924, showed¦40912 him the vista of all the kingdoms¦40916 of the world¦40919,
\v 6 and he said¦40926, “I'll give you this entire¦40939 domain¦40936 and the status of these kingdoms because¦40946 it's been given¦40948 to me, and I can give it to whoever I want,
\v 7 so just bow down in front of me and it'll all be yours.”
\p
\v 8 \x + \xo 4:8: \xt Deu 6:13.\x*“\wj It's been written¦40983,\wj*” Yeshua¦40976 answered¦40971, “\wj that we should only bow down to Yahweh our God¦40988 and only serve him.\wj*”
\p
\v 9 Then the devil led him to Yerusalem and they stood¦41002 on the highest part of the temple¦41008, where he told him, “If you're¦41015 God's son, throw¦41019 yourself¦41020 down from here,
\v 10 \x + \xo 4:10-11: \xt Psa 91:11-12.\x*because¦41024 it's written¦41023 that God will command¦41029 his¦41028 messengers to guard¦41033 you
\v 11 and they will carry¦41039 you in their hands¦41038, so you won't even hurt your¦41047 foot¦41046 on a stone¦41044.”
\p
\v 12 \x + \xo 4:12: \xt Deu 6:16.\x*“\wj It's been written,\wj*” Yeshua¦41053 responded, “\wj that we shouldn't test Yahweh our God¦41063.\wj*”
\p
\v 13 So after completing¦41066 every¦41067 temptation¦41068, the devil¦41070 withdrew¦41071 from him¦41073 for a time.
\s1 Yeshua begins his ministry
\r (Mat. 4:12-17; Mrk. 1:14-15)
\p
\v 14 So then Yeshua¦41080 returned¦41078 to Galilee¦41088 in the power¦41083 of the spirit¦41085, and the news¦41090 about him¦41098 spread into the surrounding¦41096 region¦41096.
\v 15 He started teaching¦41101 in the meeting¦41104 halls¦41104 and everyone said how good it was.
\s1 Yeshua isn't appreciated in Nazareth
\r (Mat. 13:53-58; Mrk. 6:1-6)
\p
\v 16 When he got to Nazareth¦41115 where¦41118 he grew up, he went into the meeting¦41135 hall¦41135 as usual on the Rest Day and stood¦41137 up to do the reading.
\v 17 The scroll of the prophet¦41146 Isaiah was handed¦41140 to him, and opening up the scroll, he found¦41156 the place¦41158 where¦41159 it was written¦41161,
\q1
\v 18 \x + \xo 4:18-19: \xt Isa 61:1-2 (LXX).\x*“\wj Yahweh's spirit¦41162 is on me,\wj*
\q1 \wj because he has chosen and equipped me\wj*
\q1 \wj to preach¦41171 the good¦41171 message¦41171 to the poor.\wj*
\q1 \wj He has sent¦41174 me out to proclaim¦41182 freedom for captives¦41183\wj*
\q1 \wj and to restore sight¦41187 to the blind¦41186,\wj*
\q1 \wj and for the oppressed¦41190 to experience freedom.\wj*
\q1
\v 19 \wj He's sent me to proclaim¦41194 that this is the year¦41195 that Yahweh has chosen.\wj*”
\p
\v 20 Then after rolling up the scroll¦41201 and giving it back to the attendant¦41205, he sat¦41206 down \add to give his commentary\add* and every person in the room was studying him
\v 21 as he began¦41221 to speak, “\wj Today¦41227 this scripture¦41230 that you've just heard has been fulfilled¦41228.\wj*”
\p
\v 22 Later everyone was telling others about him, and they were marvelling¦41241 at his¦41252 messages¦41244 displaying \add God's\add* grace¦41246, and they asked each other, “Isn't this Yosef's son \add from down the road\add*?”
\p
\v 23 Then Yeshua answered them, “\wj I'm sure you'll all be telling me that parable¦41273 about the doctor who needed to heal¦41276 himself, because you'll be wanting me to do here in my hometown¦41292 what I did in Capernaum¦41286.\wj*
\v 24 \x + \xo 4:24: \xt Jn 4:44.\x*\wj I can assure you¦41299 all that no prophet¦41303 is accepted¦41304 by his¦41310 own hometown¦41308.\wj*
\v 25 \x + \xo 4:25: \xt 1Ki 17:1.\x*\wj There were certainly many widows¦41318 in Israel in the days¦41322 of Elijah when \add God\add* stopped the rain for three¦41334 and a half years¦41333 and caused a terrible famine¦41341.\wj*
\v 26 \x + \xo 4:26: \xt 1Ki 17:8-16.\x*\wj But Elijah wasn't sent to any of them—rather he was sent to a \add foreign\add* widow¦41363 in Zarephath in the Sidon region¦41359.\wj*

\v 27 \x + \xo 4:27: \xt 2Ki 5:1-14.\x*“\wj Also there were many people in Israel with leprousy in the days of the prophet¦41374 Elisha and¦41378 none of them were healed, but only Naaman from Syria.\wj*”
\p
\v 28 By now everyone in the meeting¦41397 hall¦41397 that heard this was furious
\v 29 and they all stood up, planning to throw him out of the city. They led him to the edge of the hill that their¦41423 town was built¦41421 on, intending to throw him over the edge,
\v 30 but somehow he just moved through the middle of them and left.
\s1 The demon-possessed man
\r (Mrk. 1:21-28)
\p
\v 31 After that, Yeshua went to Capernaum¦41439, another town in Galilee¦41442, and taught¦41452 in the meeting hall there on the Rest Days.
\v 32 \x + \xo 4:32: \xt Mat 7:28-29.\x*They were amazed¦41458 at his teaching¦41461, because¦41463 he presented his message¦41468 with authority¦41465.
\v 33 One week there was a man¦41477 at the meeting¦41475 hall¦41475 with a demon¦41480 spirit¦41479 and he yelled¦41485 out,
\v 34 “Ha! What do we have in common with you, Yeshua¦41495 the Nazarene¦41496? Did you come here to destroy¦41499 us? I know who you are—you're¦41504 the holy one from God¦41510.”
\p
\v 35 Yeshua¦41515 rebuked¦41512 the demon, saying¦41516, “\wj Be quiet¦41517! Now come¦41519 out of him!\wj*” Then the demon threw the man to the floor right in the middle of them, and came¦41534 out of him, and left¦41534 him feeling perfectly fine.
\p
\v 36 This amazed¦41544 everyone and they started asking each other, “What is this command¦41562 that has such authority¦41559 and power¦41561 that he orders evil spirits¦41565 around and they come out?”
\v 37 After that, the reports¦41575 of what he'd done were passed around to every¦41579 part of the surrounding¦41582 region¦41582.
\s1 Yeshua heals many people
\r (Mat. 8:14-17; Mrk. 1:29-34)
\p
\v 38 After getting up and leaving the meeting¦41588 hall¦41588, Yeshua went to Simon's home where Simon's mother-in-law¦41602 had been struck with a high fever¦41609 and they¦41612 asked¦41612 Yeshua about¦41614 it.
\v 39 Going over to where she was lying, Yeshua rebuked¦41621 the fever¦41624 and it left her, and she stood up straight away and got them something to eat.
\p
\v 40 In the evening, anyone who had a relative with any kind of disease¦41651 brought¦41654 their¦41665 sick relatives to Yeshua and he placed his hands¦41669 on each one of them and healed them.
\v 41 Also demons¦41679 came out from many people, yelling out, “You are God's son.”
\p But he rebuked¦41697 them and didn't allow¦41699 them to speak¦41704 because¦41706 they knew that he was the messiah¦41709.
\s1 Yeshua's preaching in Yudea
\r (Mrk. 1:35-39)
\p
\v 42 The next day¦41715, Yeshua went off to a quiet¦41719 place¦41720, but the crowds¦41723 were looking¦41725 for¦41725 him and followed after¦41725 him and insisted that he didn't leave them,
\v 43 but he told them, “\wj I also need to preach¦41756 this good¦41756 message¦41756 about God's kingdom¦41763 in other¦41752 towns, because¦41767 that's why I was sent¦41773 here.\wj*”

\v 1 \x + \xo 5:1-3: \xt Mat 13:1-2; Mrk 3:9-10; 4:1.\x*One time¦41792 when the crowd¦41795 was pressuring Yeshua that they wanted to hear¦41800 God's message¦41802 as he stood¦41808 by Lake Galilee,
\v 2 he saw two boats at the edge of the water, but the fishermen¦41827 had left the boats so they could wash their nets.
\v 3 Yeshua hopped into one of the boats¦41843 which¦41845 turned out to be Simon's, and asked¦41849 him¦41850 just to \add row\add* out a little¦41858 way from the land. Then Yeshua sat¦41861 there in the boat¦41868 and taught¦41863 the crowds¦41872 from there.
\p
\v 4 Once he'd finished his speaking¦41877, he told Simon¦41881, “\wj Go out to the deeper parts and lower¦41888 your¦41892 nets¦41891 to catch¦41894 \add some fish\add*.\wj*”
\p
\v 5 \x + \xo 5:5: \xt Jn 21:3.\x*“Master¦41905,” Simon¦41899 answered¦41896, “we¦41912 worked all through¦41906 the night¦41909 and didn't catch anything, but¦41914 ok, I'll do what you¦41918 say and lower¦41924 the nets¦41928.”

\v 7 and they \add had to\add* signal¦41951 to their companions¦41955 in the other¦41959 boat¦41960 to come¦41963 and help¦41965. When they got there, they filled¦41974 both boats¦41979 \add with so many fish that the weight\add* began to sink them.
\v 8 When Simon¦41991 Peter \add had a moment\add* to realise what had just happened he¦41995 knelt \add in the boat\add* in front of Yeshua¦41999 and said, “You must leave me, master¦42009, because¦42005 I'm just a sinful¦42007 man¦42006.”
\p
\v 9 Peter and all those with him were stunned at the size of the catch¦42023.
\v 10 This included Yacob and Yohan (Zebedee's¦42043 sons¦42042) who were his \add fishing\add* partners¦42046.
\p
\v 11 When they got the boats¦42083 up onto the shore, they left everything there and followed¦42096 after¦42097 Yeshua.
\s1 Yeshua heals a man with leprosy
\r (Mat. 8:1-4; Mrk. 1:40-45)
\p
\v 12 In one of the towns that they visited, a man¦42110 covered in leprous¦42112 \add lesions\add* lay face¦42122 down in front of Yeshua¦42118 when he saw him, and implored him, “Master¦42126, if you wanted you'd be able to heal me.”
\p
\v 13 Yeshua reached out his hand¦42137 and touched¦42139 him, saying¦42142, “I do want it. Be free from this.” Immediately the man was clear of leprosy¦42149.
\v 14 \x + \xo 5:14: \xt Lev 14:1-32.\x*“\wj Don't tell others,\wj*” Yeshua instructed, “\wj but go directly to the priest¦42168 with the offering¦42170 commanded by Moses and show yourself¦42166 to him¦42157 \add for clearance\add* and as a testimony¦42181 to them.\wj*”
\p
\v 15 However the news about Yeshua was spreading all around, and large crowds¦42228 were gathering to listen to him¦42225 and to be healed¦42232 from their¦42239 diseases
\v 16 but then he would withdraw¦42243 into the wilderness¦42246 to pray.
\s1 A paralysed man is lowered through the roof
\r (Mat. 9:1-8; Mrk. 2:1-12)
\p
\v 17 Yeshua was teaching one day, and some from the Pharisee¦42267 party¦42267 and some religious teachers¦42271 were sitting¦42263 there \add listening\add*. They had come¦42277 from villages¦42281 all around Galilee¦42284 and Yudea, and also from Yerusalem, and the power¦42290 of Yahweh was there enabling Yeshua to heal people.
\v 18 Then, look, some men¦42301 turned up carrying¦42302 a paralysed¦42310 man¦42306 on a stretcher, and they tried to bring him inside and place him in front of Yeshua
\v 19 but because¦42329 of the crowd¦42331 they couldn't find a way¦42326 in. So instead, they went \add up the stairs\add* to the \add flat\add* roof and removed some tiles¦42342 in order to let the stretcher¦42352 down right in front of Yeshua¦42360.
\v 20 When he saw their¦42368 faith¦42367, he said¦42369, “Man, your¦42380 sins¦42379 have been forgiven¦42375.”
\p
\v 21 “Who is this guy who's insulting God?” the teachers¦42385 and¦42386 Pharisees started to say among themselves. “Only God is able to forgive¦42403 sins¦42404.”
\p
\v 22 But Yeshua¦42415 knew what they were thinking¦42426 and saying, and answered¦42419 them, “\wj Why are you reasoning¦42426 about this in your¦42430 minds?\wj*
\v 23 \wj Which¦42432 is easier¦42434 to say: ‘Your¦42442 sins¦42441 have been forgiven¦42437,’ or ‘Stand up and walk¦42449’?\wj*
\v 24 \wj But I'll demonstrate to you that humankind's child \em does\em* have the authority¦42461 to forgive¦42466 sins¦42467 here on earth¦42465.\wj*” Then he turned to the paralysed¦42473 man and told him, “Listen to me. Stand up and pick up your¦42485 stretcher¦42483 and go home.”
\p
\v 25 Immediately the man stood¦42494 up right in front of them all, picked up what he'd been lying¦42504 on,and headed off to his¦42510 home¦42509 praising God¦42513.
\v 26 Everyone was astounded and they also praised¦42519 God¦42521. But there was also a feeling of fear¦42524 and they said, “We've¦42532 witnessed something out-of-the-normal today¦42535!”
\s1 Levi follows Yeshua and hosts a banquet
\r (Mat. 9:9-13; Mrk. 2:13-17)
\p
\v 27 Yeshua went outside after that and he saw a tax collector¦42555 named Levi¦42557 sitting¦42563 in his office¦42566 and told him, “\wj Come and follow¦42571 me.\wj*”
\v 28 So Levi left everything and went and followed¦42581 Yeshua.
\p
\v 29 Then Levi¦42590 prepared a large meal in his¦42597 home for Yeshua, plus there¦42599 were also a lot of tax-collectors and others¦42606 who were sitting¦42612 with them.
\v 30 \x + \xo 5:30: \xt Luk 15:1-2.\x*Some from the Pharisees party¦42617 and religious¦42622 teachers¦42622 grumbled¦42615 at Yeshua's followers¦42629, complaining, “Why are you all eating¦42639 and drinking¦42642 with tax¦42636 collectors¦42636 and other low-life?”
\p
\v 31 But it was Yeshua¦42648 that answered¦42645, “\wj Healthy people don't¦42653 need a doctor¦42658—only those who're sick¦42661.\wj*
\v 32 \wj I didn't come to call those who're ‘righteous¦42667’, but to call sinners¦42670 to come and turn from disobeying God.\wj*”
\s1 The question about fasting
\r (Mat. 9:14-17; Mrk. 2:18-22)
\p
\v 33 Then the religious leaders complained, “Yohan's followers often fast and bring their needs to God, as do the Pharisees, but your followers are eating¦42706 and drinking¦42708.”
\p
\v 34 “\wj You can't make the best men fast at a wedding,\wj*” Yeshua¦42713 responded, “\wj not while the groom¦42733 is with them.\wj*
\v 35 \wj But yes, there will be a future time when the groom¦42751 will be taken¦42747 away from them, and then they'll fast.\wj*”
\p
\v 36 Then he went on to tell them this parable¦42762, “\wj No one repairs their old clothes by putting¦42773 on a patch of new material. If they did, the new patch will likely tear off again, plus it wouldn't look right anyway.\wj*
\v 37 \wj Similarly, no one puts new wine \add to mature\add* into old wineskins. If they did, the new wine would certainly burst¦42811 the old wineskin and it would all pour out and the wineskin would be ruined as well.\wj*
\v 38 \wj New wine needs to be put into a new wineskin¦42835.\wj*
\v 39 \wj And no one who's \add used to\add* the old \add ways\add* wants the new, because¦42852 he'll claim that the old is good¦42855 \add enough\add*.\wj*”
