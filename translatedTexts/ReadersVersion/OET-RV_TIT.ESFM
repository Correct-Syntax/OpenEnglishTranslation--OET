\is1 Introduction
\is2 The author
\ip Paul
\is2 The recipient
\ip Titus wasn't a Jew and didn't originally believe in God. However, in later times he became a believer and from there, he became a helper in Paul's work. This letter was sent by Paul there to Titus in Crete where he had been left to look after a group of believers. (Crete is an island that was a part of Greece.)
\is2 This letter
\ip There are three main things contained in this letter: Firstly Titus is reminded about what is appropriate behaviour for teachers of believers. It was important that he understand this because those from Crete had many undesirable customs and there were many teachers of false doctrines that would confuse believers.
\ip Secondly Titus was advised Titus how to teach the various groups of believers there, including young men and slaves, along with older men and women. (Then those older women were to teach the younger women.)
\ip Finally Paul advised Titus about how believers should live, including avoiding attacking others, arguing, and splitting the believers into opposing groups. Paul reminded Titus again to follow the teachings of Jesus the messiah and obey what he commanded us.
\ip Paul wanted it to be known that it's very important for believers to behave well (1:6; 2:7,14; 3:1,8-9,14) even though doing good things can't earn their salvation (3:5).

\v 1 \add This letter is from\add* Paul, a slave¦140840 of God and a missionary of Jesus the messiah¦140846 and follower of the faith¦140848 of the ones that God has chosen.
\p I share the knowledge¦140852 of the truth¦140853 which¦140854 leads to godliness
\v 2 and the expectation of living forever which¦140861 God promised¦140862 before¦140866 time began. And God can't lie
\v 3 but¦140870 revealed¦140869 his message¦140874 in his own time, and¦140882 I've been entrusted¦140879 to proclaim¦140877 this by the command¦140882 of God our¦140884 saviour¦140884.
\p
\v 4 \x + \xo 1:4: \xt 2Cor 8:23; Gal 2:3; 2Tim 4:10.\x*To Titus, my true son due to our common¦140891 faith¦140892. May God the father¦140899 and our saviour¦140906 Jesus the messiah¦140902 give you grace¦140893 and peace¦140896.
\s1 Qualifications for leaders
\p
\v 5 The reason¦140909 that I asked you to stay behind¦140910 in Crete was so that you would find what needed to be reorganised and so that you would appoint¦140921 elders¦140924 in every city¦140923 just as I had directed¦140928 you.
\v 6 \x + \xo 1:6-9: \xt 1Tim 3:2-7.\x*Each elder must have a clean record, be the husband¦140935 of one wife¦140934, and¦140935 have believing¦140938 children¦140936 who are not wild or disobedient.
\v 7 Any overseer¦140948 \add in the assembly\add* as a manager¦140953 working for God must have a clean record, not be self-centred¦140955, not be quick to get angry, not addicted to wine, not a bully¦140961, and not greedy¦140963,
\v 8 but¦140964 rather hospitable¦140965, someone who loves what is good¦140966, sensible¦140967, honest, loves God, and self-controlled¦140970.
\v 9 He must hold faithfully¦140976 to the message that was taught, so that he will be effective in encouraging others with sound¦140990 teaching and to be rebuking¦140994 those who speak¦140993 against¦140993 the message.
\s1 Handling those who go off the track
\p
\v 10 There's plenty of people who don't want to be told what to do, empty talkers¦141000 and¦141001 outright deceivers¦141002, especially those that push the letter of the law.
\v 11 These people need to be silenced¦141011 because they mess up whole¦141013 families when they teach¦141016 them things¦141017 that they shouldn't—all for the sake of shameful¦141021 game.
\v 12 One of their¦141027 own prophets¦141031 said¦141024 that the people from Crete¦141032 are liars¦141034, evil¦141035 beasts¦141036, and lazy gluttons,
\v 13 and that's right. For those reasons, you need to sternly tell them they're wrong, so that they can become sound¦141051 in their faith¦141054,
\v 14 and¦141059 not pay attention to Jewish myths¦141058 or human¦141061 rules which turn people away from the truth¦141064.
\v 15 For someone who's pure in their thinking, everything is pure to them, but for unbelievers¦141076 and those who've strayed from the truth, nothing¦141077 is pure because their minds and consciences¦141087 have already been damaged—
\v 16 they say that they know God, but their¦141091 actions show that they don't, and so they're detestable¦141095. They can no longer accept teaching so they're unsuitable for any good¦141103 work.

\s1 Proper behaviour for believers
\p
\v 1 But you¦141105, \add Titus\add* speak¦141108 only what comes from sound¦141112 teaching¦141113.
\v 2 Older men¦141114 need to be sober¦141115, dignified¦141118, sensible¦141119, and sound¦141120 in their faith¦141122, their love¦141124, and their endurance¦141126.
\v 3 Likewise older¦141127 women¦141127 need to honour God by their behaviour¦141130, not making false accusations, not addicted to a lot of wine. They should teaching¦141140 what is good¦141140
\v 4 so that they¦141143 can train the younger women¦141145 to love their husbands¦141146 and children¦141148,
\v 5 and to be sensible¦141149 and pure, homemakers¦141151 that do good¦141153 for others, living under the authority of their¦141156 husbands¦141158 so that others don't speak evil of God's message¦141162 because of them.
\p
\v 6 Also encourage younger¦141170 men¦141170 to be sensible¦141173.
\v 7 Be a good¦141180 example¦141179 in everything you do and in your teaching¦141184. Don't be led astray, maintain your dignity¦141189,
\v 8 watch every word that comes out of your lips, stay above reproach—all this so that those who oppose us can be reached because there's nothing¦141199 bad¦141207 they can say about us.
\p
\v 9 Slaves¦141208 need to conform to their master's commands, aiming to please¦141215. They shouldn't speak¦141218 against¦141218 their masters¦141210
\v 10 or be pilfering from them, rather they¦141236 should display¦141225 their good¦141226 faith¦141224 so that their actions add to the teachings¦141229 of God our¦141232 saviour¦141232.
\p
\v 11 This is because God's grace¦141242 which offers salvation¦141246 to all people¦141249 has appeared¦141239
\v 12 and teaches us that when we distance ourselves from ungodliness¦141257 and worldly¦141260 lusts¦141261, we can live¦141267 sensibly¦141262 and justly¦141264 and devoutly¦141266 in the present¦141270 age.
\v 13 Then we can look forward to the blessing¦141274 of the majestic appearance¦141277 of our¦141284 great¦141281 God and saviour¦141284, Jesus the messiah¦141288
\v 14 \x + \xo 2:14: a \xt Psa 130:8; \xo b \xt Exo 19:5; Deu 4:20; 7:6; 14:2; 1Pe 2:9.\x*who gave¦141290 himself for us in order¦141295 to redeem¦141296 us from all lawlessness¦141300 and to purify¦141302 us into his chosen¦141305 people¦141304, eager to do good¦141307 things.
\p
\v 15 Teach these¦141309 things¦141309 as you encourage some and scold others, but don't let anyone disrepect¦141321 you.
\c 3
\s1 Expected behaviour
\p
\v 1 Remind people to conform to their rulers¦141326 and authorities¦141328, being¦141329 obedient and ready¦141337 to do anything that's good¦141335.
\v 2 Don't slander¦141340 others, be peaceable¦141341. Don't be strong-willed, but rather show gentleness¦141343 to all people¦141353. 
\v 3 We were also foolish¦141359 and stubborn at one time, straying¦141361 from the good and giving in to various¦141367 lusts¦141364 and pleasures, being¦141361 mean and envious, even full of hate and hating¦141374 one another¦141375.
\v 4 But when God our¦141385 saviour¦141385 revealed his¦141384 kindness¦141379 and¦141380 love¦141382 for mankind¦141382,
\v 5 he saved¦141405 us, not because of the ‘good deeds’ that we did, but out of his mercy¦141403. He regenerated¦141410 us through¦141407 washing¦141409 and renewed¦141412 us by \add his\add* pure spirit¦141413
\v 6 which he lavishly poured¦141416 on us through¦141420 Jesus¦141421 the messiah¦141422
\v 7 so that we might become¦141434 heirs¦141432 with the expectation of living forever, having¦141427 been declared that we have no outstanding legal charges thanks to his¦141437 grace¦141431.
\v 8 That statement can be trusted. I want you to confirm¦141447 those things so that those who have believed¦141454 in God will be leading¦141452 in wanting to do good things. These¦141457 things are good and benefit¦141462 everyone.
\p
\v 9 But avoid¦141476 foolish¦141465 debates¦141467, arguments about ancestry, other strife¦141471, and quarrels¦141474 about the commandments because they¦141477 all achieve nothing and waste time.
\v 10 Refuse to listen to a divisive person¦141483 after¦141484 you've given them two warnings
\v 11 knowing that such people condemn themselves by their corruption and¦141495 sinful attitude.
\s1 Closing
\p
\v 12 \x + \xo 3:12: \xt Acts 20:4; Eph 6:21-22; Col 4:7-8; 2Tim 4:12.\x*Whenever¦141499 I send¦141500 Artemas¦141501 or Tychicus to you, you should try to meet me at Nicopolis, because I've decided to spend the winter¦141515 there¦141512.
\v 13 \x + \xo 3:13: \xt Acts 18:24; 1Cor 16:12.\x*Help by sending Zenas the lawyer¦141518 and¦141519 Apollos¦141520 on their way so that they won't be needing anything.
\v 14 Our people¦141532 must also be learning¦141528 to be leading¦141535 in doing good¦141533 things to meet the necessary¦141538 needs¦141539 so that they¦141542 won't be unproductive.
\p
\v 15 Everyone here with me sends their greetings to you. And please greet the ones there for us who love us in the faith¦141556.
\p May \add God's\add* grace¦141558 be with all of you.
