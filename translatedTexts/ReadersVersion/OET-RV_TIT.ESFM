\is1 Introduction
\is2 The author
\ip Paul
\is2 The recipient
\ip Titus wasn't a Jew and didn't originally believe in God. However, in later times he became a believer and from there, he became a helper in Paul's work. This letter was sent by Paul there to Titus in Crete where he had been left to look after a group of believers. (Crete is an island that was a part of Greece.)
\is2 This letter
\ip There are three main things contained in this letter: Firstly Titus is reminded about what is appropriate behaviour for teachers of believers. It was important that he understand this because those from Crete had many undesirable customs and there were many teachers of false doctrines that would confuse believers.
\ip Secondly Titus was advised Titus how to teach the various groups of believers there, including young men and slaves, along with older men and women. (Then those older women were to teach the younger women.)
\ip Finally Paul advised Titus about how believers should live, including avoiding attacking others, arguing, and splitting the believers into opposing groups. Paul reminded Titus again to follow the teachings of Jesus the messiah and obey what he commanded us.
\ip Paul wanted it to be known that it's very important for believers to behave well (1:6; 2:7,14; 3:1,8-9,14) even though doing good things can't earn their salvation (3:5).

\v 1 \add This letter is from\add* Paul, a slave of God and a missionary of Jesus the messiah and follower of the faith¦140848 of the ones that God has chosen.
\p I share the knowledge of the truth¦140853 which leads to godliness
\v 2 and the expectation of living forever which God promised before time began. And God can't lie
\v 3 but revealed his message¦140874 in his own time, and I've been entrusted to proclaim this by the command¦140882 of God our saviour.
\p
\v 4 \x + \xo 1:4: \xt 2Cor 8:23; Gal 2:3; 2Tim 4:10.\x*To Titus, my true son due to our common faith¦140892. May God the father¦140899 and our saviour Jesus the messiah give you grace¦140893 and peace¦140896.
\s1 Qualifications for leaders
\p
\v 5 The reason that I asked you to stay behind in Crete was so that you would find what needed to be reorganised and so that you would appoint elders in every city¦140923 just as I had directed you.
\v 6 \x + \xo 1:6-9: \xt 1Tim 3:2-7.\x*Each elder must have a clean record, be the husband¦140935 of one wife¦140934, and have believing children¦140936 who are not wild or disobedient.
\v 7 Any overseer \add in the assembly\add* as a manager working for God must have a clean record, not be self-centred, not be quick to get angry, not addicted to wine, not a bully, and not greedy,
\v 8 but rather hospitable, someone who loves what is good, sensible, honest, loves God, and self-controlled.
\v 9 He must hold faithfully to the message that was taught, so that he will be effective in encouraging others with sound teaching and to be rebuking those who speak against the message.
\s1 Handling those who go off the track
\p
\v 10 There's plenty of people who don't want to be told what to do, empty talkers and outright deceivers, especially those that push the letter of the law.
\v 11 These people need to be silenced because they mess up whole families when they teach them things¦141017 that they shouldn't—all for the sake of shameful game.
\v 12 One of their own prophets said that the people from Crete are liars, evil beasts, and lazy gluttons,
\v 13 and that's right. For those reasons, you need to sternly tell them they're wrong, so that they can become sound in their faith¦141054,
\v 14 and not pay attention to Jewish myths or human rules which turn people away from the truth¦141064.
\v 15 For someone who's pure in their thinking, everything is pure to them, but for unbelievers and those who've strayed from the truth, nothing is pure because their minds and consciences have already been damaged—
\v 16 they say that they know God, but their actions show that they don't, and so they're detestable. They can no longer accept teaching so they're unsuitable for any good work.
\c 2
\s1 Proper behaviour for believers
\p
\v 1 But you, \add Titus\add* speak only what comes from sound teaching.
\v 2 Older men¦141114 need to be sober, dignified, sensible, and sound in their faith¦141122, their love, and their endurance.
\v 3 Likewise older women¦141127 need to honour God by their behaviour, not making false accusations, not addicted to a lot of wine. They should teaching what is good
\v 4 so that they can train the younger women¦141145 to love their husbands and children,
\v 5 and to be sensible and pure, homemakers that do good for others, living under the authority of their husbands¦141158 so that others don't speak evil of God's message¦141162 because of them.
\p
\v 6 Also encourage younger men¦141170 to be sensible.
\v 7 Be a good example in everything you do and in your teaching. Don't be led astray, maintain your dignity,
\v 8 watch every word that comes out of your lips, stay above reproach—all this so that those who oppose us can be reached because there's nothing bad they can say about us.
\p
\v 9 Slaves need to conform to their master's commands, aiming to please. They shouldn't speak against their masters
\v 10 or be pilfering from them, rather they should display their good faith¦141224 so that their actions add to the teachings of God our saviour.
\p
\v 11 This is because God's grace¦141242 which offers salvation to all people¦141249 has appeared
\v 12 and teaches us that when we distance ourselves from ungodliness and worldly lusts, we can live sensibly and justly and devoutly in the present age.
\v 13 Then we can look forward to the blessing of the majestic appearance of our great God and saviour, Jesus the messiah
\v 14 \x + \xo 2:14: a \xt Psa 130:8; \xo b \xt Exo 19:5; Deu 4:20; 7:6; 14:2; 1Pe 2:9.\x*who gave himself for us in order to redeem us from all lawlessness and to purify us into his chosen people¦141304, eager to do good things.
\p
\v 15 Teach these things¦141309 as you encourage some and scold others, but don't let anyone disrepect you.
\c 3
\s1 Expected behaviour
\p
\v 1 Remind people to conform to their rulers and authorities, being obedient and ready to do anything that's good.
\v 2 Don't slander others, be peaceable. Don't be strong-willed, but rather show gentleness to all people¦141353. 
\v 3 We were also foolish and stubborn at one time, straying from the good and giving in to various lusts and pleasures, being mean and envious, even full of hate and hating one another.
\v 4 But when God our saviour revealed his kindness and love for mankind,
\v 5 he saved us, not because of the ‘good deeds’ that we did, but out of his mercy. He regenerated us through washing and renewed us by \add his\add* pure spirit
\v 6 which he lavishly poured on us through Jesus¦141421 the messiah
\v 7 so that we might become heirs with the expectation of living forever, having been declared that we have no outstanding legal charges thanks to his grace¦141431.
\v 8 That statement can be trusted. I want you to confirm those things so that those who have believed in God will be leading in wanting to do good things. These things are good and benefit everyone.
\p
\v 9 But avoid foolish debates, arguments about ancestry, other strife, and quarrels about the commandments because they all achieve nothing and waste time.
\v 10 Refuse to listen to a divisive person after you've given them two warnings
\v 11 knowing that such people condemn themselves by their corruption and sinful attitude.
\s1 Closing
\p
\v 12 \x + \xo 3:12: \xt Acts 20:4; Eph 6:21-22; Col 4:7-8; 2Tim 4:12.\x*Whenever I send Artemas or Tychicus to you, you should try to meet me at Nicopolis, because I've decided to spend the winter there.
\v 13 \x + \xo 3:13: \xt Acts 18:24; 1Cor 16:12.\x*Help by sending Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their way so that they won't be needing anything.
\v 14 Our people¦141532 must also be learning to be leading in doing good things to meet the necessary needs so that they won't be unproductive.
\p
\v 15 Everyone here with me sends their greetings to you. And please greet the ones there for us who love us in the faith¦141556.
\p May \add God's\add* grace¦141558 be with all of you.
