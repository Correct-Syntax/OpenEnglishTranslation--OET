\is1 Introduction
\is2 The author
\ip Paul
\is2 The recipient
\ip Titus wasn't a Jew and didn't originally believe in God. However, in later times he became a believer and from there, he became a helper in Paul's work. This letter was sent by Paul there to Titus in Crete where he had been left to look after a group of believers. (Crete is an island that was a part of Greece.)
\is2 This letter
\ip There are three main things contained in this letter: Firstly Titus is reminded about what is appropriate behaviour for teachers of believers. It was important that he understand this because those from Crete had many undesirable customs and there were many teachers of false doctrines that would confuse believers.
\ip Secondly Titus was advised Titus how to teach the various groups of believers there, including young men and slaves, along with older men and women. (Then those older women were to teach the younger women.)
\ip Finally Paul advised Titus about how believers should live, including avoiding attacking others, arguing, and splitting the believers into opposing groups. Paul reminded Titus again to follow the teachings of Yeshua the messiah and obey what he commanded us.
\ip Paul wanted it to be known that it's very important for believers to behave well (1:6; 2:7,14; 3:1,8-9,14) even though doing good things can't earn their salvation (3:5).

\v 1 \add This letter is from\add* Paul¦140840, a slave¦140841 of God and a missionary of Yeshua¦140846 the messiah¦140847 and follower of the faith¦140849 of the ones that God has chosen.
\p I share the knowledge¦140853 of the truth¦140854 which¦140855 leads to godliness
\v 2 and the expectation of living forever which¦140862 God promised¦140863 before¦140867 time began. And God can't lie
\v 3 but¦140871 revealed¦140870 his message¦140875 in his own time, and¦140883 I've been entrusted¦140880 to proclaim¦140878 this by the command¦140883 of God¦140887 our¦140885 saviour¦140885.
\p
\v 4 \x + \xo 1:4: \xt 2Cor 8:23; Gal 2:3; 2Tim 4:10.\x*To Titus, my true son due to our common¦140892 faith¦140893. May God¦140899 the father¦140900 and our saviour¦140907 Yeshua¦140904 the messiah¦140903 give you grace¦140894 and peace¦140897.
\s1 Qualifications for leaders
\p
\v 5 The reason¦140910 that I asked you to stay behind¦140911 in Crete was so that you would find what needed to be reorganised and so that you would appoint¦140922 elders¦140925 in every city¦140924 just as I had directed¦140929 you.
\v 6 \x + \xo 1:6-9: \xt 1Tim 3:2-7.\x*Each elder must have a clean record, be the husband¦140936 of one wife¦140935, and¦140936 have believing¦140939 children¦140937 who are not wild or disobedient.
\v 7 Any overseer¦140949 \add in the assembly\add* as a manager¦140954 working for God¦140953 must have a clean record, not be self-centred¦140956, not be quick to get angry, not addicted to wine, not a bully¦140962, and not greedy¦140964,
\v 8 but¦140965 rather hospitable¦140966, someone who loves what is good¦140967, sensible¦140968, honest, loves God, and self-controlled¦140971.
\v 9 He must hold faithfully¦140977 to the message that was taught¦140976, so that he will be effective in encouraging others with sound¦140991 teaching and to be rebuking¦140995 those who speak¦140994 against¦140994 the message.
\s1 Handling those who go off the track
\p
\v 10 There's plenty of people who don't want to be told what to do, empty talkers¦141001 and¦141002 outright deceivers¦141003, especially those that push the letter of the law.
\v 11 These people need to be silenced¦141012 because¦141024 they mess up whole¦141014 families when they teach¦141017 them things¦141018 that they shouldn't—all for the sake of shameful¦141022 game.
\v 12 One of their¦141028 own prophets¦141032 said¦141025 that the people from Crete are liars¦141035, evil¦141036 beasts¦141037, and lazy gluttons,
\v 13 and that's right. For those reasons, you need to sternly tell them they're wrong, so that they can become sound¦141052 in their faith¦141055,
\v 14 and¦141060 not pay attention to Jewish myths¦141059 or human¦141062 rules which turn people away from the truth¦141065.
\v 15 For someone who's pure in their thinking, everything is pure to them, but for unbelievers¦141077 and those who've strayed from the truth, nothing¦141078 is pure because their minds and consciences¦141088 have already been damaged—
\v 16 they say that they know God¦141089, but their¦141092 actions show that they don't, and so they're detestable¦141096. They can no longer accept teaching so they're unsuitable for any good¦141104 work.

\s1 Proper behaviour for believers
\p
\v 1 But you¦141106, \add Titus\add* speak¦141109 only what comes from sound¦141113 teaching¦141114.
\v 2 Older men¦141115 need to be sober¦141116, dignified¦141119, sensible¦141120, and sound¦141121 in their faith¦141123, their love¦141125, and their endurance¦141127.
\v 3 Likewise older¦141128 women¦141128 need to honour God by their behaviour¦141131, not making false accusations, not addicted to a lot of wine. They should teaching¦141141 what is good¦141141
\v 4 so that they¦141144 can train the younger women¦141146 to love their husbands¦141147 and children¦141149,
\v 5 and to be sensible¦141150 and pure, homemakers¦141152 that do good¦141154 for others, living under the authority of their¦141157 husbands¦141159 so that others don't¦141161 speak evil of God's message¦141163 because of them.
\p
\v 6 Also encourage younger¦141171 men¦141171 to be sensible¦141174.
\v 7 Be a good¦141181 example¦141180 in everything you do and in your teaching¦141185. Don't be led astray, maintain your dignity¦141190,
\v 8 watch every word that comes out of your lips, stay above reproach—all this so that those who oppose us can be reached because there's nothing¦141200 bad¦141208 they can say about us.
\p
\v 9 Slaves¦141209 need to conform to their master's commands, aiming to please¦141216. They shouldn't speak¦141219 against¦141219 their masters¦141211
\v 10 or be pilfering from them, rather they¦141237 should display¦141226 their good¦141227 faith¦141225 so that their actions add to the teachings¦141230 of God¦141236 our¦141233 saviour¦141233.
\p
\v 11 This is because God's grace¦141243 which offers salvation¦141247 to all people¦141250 has appeared¦141240
\v 12 and teaches us that when we distance ourselves from ungodliness¦141258 and worldly¦141261 lusts¦141262, we can live¦141268 sensibly¦141263 and justly¦141265 and devoutly¦141267 in the present¦141271 age.
\v 13 Then we can look forward to the blessing¦141275 of the majestic appearance¦141278 of our¦141285 great¦141282 God¦141283 and saviour¦141285, Yeshua¦141288 the messiah¦141289
\v 14 \x + \xo 2:14: a \xt Psa 130:8; \xo b \xt Exo 19:5; Deu 4:20; 7:6; 14:2; 1Pe 2:9.\x*who gave¦141291 himself for us in order¦141296 to redeem¦141297 us from all lawlessness¦141301 and to purify¦141303 us into his chosen¦141306 people¦141305, eager to do good¦141308 things.
\p
\v 15 Teach these¦141310 things¦141310 as you encourage some and scold others, but don't let anyone disrepect¦141322 you.
\c 3
\s1 Expected behaviour
\p
\v 1 Remind people to conform to their rulers¦141327 and authorities¦141329, being¦141330 obedient and ready¦141338 to do anything that's good¦141336.
\v 2 Don't slander¦141341 others, be peaceable¦141342. Don't be strong-willed, but rather show gentleness¦141344 to all people¦141354. 
\v 3 We were also foolish¦141360 and stubborn at one time, straying¦141362 from the good and giving in to various¦141368 lusts¦141365 and pleasures, being¦141362 mean and envious, even full of hate and hating¦141375 one another¦141376.
\v 4 But when God¦141388 our¦141386 saviour¦141386 revealed his kindness¦141380 and¦141381 love¦141383 for mankind¦141383,
\v 5 he saved¦141406 us, not because of the ‘good deeds’ that we did, but out of his mercy¦141404. He regenerated¦141411 us through¦141408 washing¦141410 and renewed¦141413 us by \add his\add* pure¦141415 spirit¦141414
\v 6 which he lavishly poured¦141417 on us through¦141421 Yeshua¦141422 the messiah¦141423
\v 7 so that we might become¦141435 heirs¦141433 with the expectation of living forever, having¦141428 been declared that we have no outstanding legal charges thanks to his grace¦141432.
\v 8 That statement can be trusted. I want you to confirm¦141448 those things so that those who have believed¦141455 in God¦141457 will be leading¦141453 in wanting to do good things. These¦141458 things are good and benefit¦141463 everyone¦141465.
\p
\v 9 But avoid¦141477 foolish¦141466 debates¦141468, arguments about ancestry, other strife¦141472, and quarrels¦141475 about the commandments because¦141479 they¦141478 all achieve nothing and waste time.
\v 10 Refuse to listen to a divisive person¦141484 after¦141485 you've given them two warnings
\v 11 knowing¦141491 that such people condemn themselves by their corruption and¦141496 sinful attitude.
\s1 Closing
\p
\v 12 \x + \xo 3:12: \xt Acts 20:4; Eph 6:21-22; Col 4:7-8; 2Tim 4:12.\x*Whenever¦141500 I send¦141501 Artemas¦141502 or Tychicus to you, you should try to meet me at Nicopolis, because¦141514 I've decided to spend the winter¦141516 there¦141513.
\v 13 \x + \xo 3:13: \xt Acts 18:24; 1Cor 16:12.\x*Help by sending Zenas the lawyer¦141519 and¦141520 Apollos¦141521 on their way so that they won't be needing anything.
\v 14 Our people¦141533 must also be learning¦141529 to be leading¦141536 in doing good¦141534 things to meet the necessary¦141539 needs¦141540 so that they¦141543 won't be unproductive.
\p
\v 15 Everyone here with me sends their greetings to you. And please greet the ones there for us who love us in the faith¦141557.
\p May \add God's\add* grace¦141559 be with all of you.
