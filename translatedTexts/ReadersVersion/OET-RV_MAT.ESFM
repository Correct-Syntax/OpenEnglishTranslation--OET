\s1 The birth of the messiah
\r (Luk. 2:1-7)
\p
\v 18 \x + \xo 1:18: \xt Luk 1:27.\x*Now this is how the birth¦302 of Yeshua¦299 came about: Maria¦311 his¦310 mother¦309 was engaged to Joseph¦313. But before¦314 they came together¦316, she¦318 was found¦318 to be pregnant through \add the work of\add* the holy spirit¦323.
\v 19 But Joseph¦325, her husband¦328 \add to be\add* was a good man, and not wishing to disgrace Maria, he¦327 decided to quietly divorce her.
\v 20 But as he was pondering this, one of God's messengers¦347 appeared to him in a dream¦351 and told him, “Don't to be afraid¦359 to marry Maria¦361 because¦366 the baby in her has been conceived by the holy spirit¦371.
\v 21 \x + \xo 1:21: \xt Luk 1:31.\x*In due course she will have a son and you'll name¦381 him Yeshua¦383, because¦385 he will save his¦382 people¦388 from their¦393 sins¦392.”
\p
\v 22 Now all this happened in fulfilment¦399 of what the God had said through¦405 the prophet¦408,
\v 23 \x + \xo 1:23: \xt Isa 7:14 (LXX).\x*“Look. The virgin¦412 will get pregnant and she will have a son, and they¦420 will call him¦424 Immanuel¦425 (Grk: Immanouel) which¦426 means ‘God¦432 with us.’ ”
\p
\v 24 Then Joseph¦437 got up and did what God's messenger¦446 had commanded¦443 him and he went ahead and married Maria
\v 25 \x + \xo 1:25: \xt Luk 2:21.\x*but he didn't sleep with her until¦459 after she gave birth. And Joseph named the boy Yeshua¦472.

\s1 Easterners come to worship the new king
\p
\v 1 After Yeshua¦475 had been born in Bethlehem¦478 in the province of Judea¦480 during the time of King Herod¦483, watchers of signs arrived¦491 in Jerusalem¦493 from the east
\v 2 and asked, “Where¦496 is the one born as king¦500 of the Jews¦502, because we saw¦503 his¦505 star¦507 in the east and we came¦512 to worship him.”
\p
\v 3 Now when King Herod¦520 heard¦515 this, he was upset and¦522 all of Jerusalem¦524 as well.
\v 4 He gathered¦528 together¦528 all of the chief¦531 priests¦531 and those who teach the religious law to the people¦535 and asked them where¦539 the Messiah was expected to be born.
\p
\v 5 And they¦543 told him¦547, “It'll be in Bethlehem¦549 in Judea¦551 because¦553 the prophet¦557 wrote:
\q1
\v 6 \x + \xo 2:6: \xt Mic 5:2.\x*‘You Bethlehem¦560 in the land of Judah,
\q2 are not the most insignificant of the leaders of Judah.
\q1 For a leader will come from you
\q2 who will guide my¦587 people¦586 Israel.’ ”
\p
\v 7 Then Herod¦591 sent for the watchers of signs and met secretly¦592 with them to determine when the star¦604 had first appeared¦603.
\v 8 Then he sent¦606 them on to Bethlehem¦609 with these instructions: “Go on and carefully investigate about the child¦619 and when you find him, report¦626 back to me so that I can also come¦630 and worship him.”
\p
\v 9 So when the king¦638 had finished speaking, they departed and the star¦643 which¦644 they could see¦641 in the east went ahead of them and stopped above the place where¦657 the child¦661 was.
\v 10 Seeing this, the watchers of signs were very happy indeed.
\v 11 As they entered the house¦676, the saw¦677 the child¦681 with his¦687 mother¦686 Maria¦684. They bowed low and worshipped him, then they opened¦693 their¦696 chests and presented gifts¦699 of gold¦700, frankincense¦702, and myrrh¦704.
\p
\v 12 But because they had been warned¦706 in a dream¦708 not to return¦710 to King Herod¦712, they went home again to their¦721 own country¦720.
\s1 The escape to Egypt
\p
\v 13 After they had departed, a messenger¦732 of the Lord appeared¦734 to Joseph¦740 in a dream¦736 and said, “Get up and take the child and his¦753 mother¦752 and flee to Egypt¦757. Remain there¦760 until¦761 I tell you because¦767 \add King\add* Herod¦768 will soon search for the child in order to kill¦775 him.”
\p
\v 14 So Joseph got up during the night¦791 and took¦782 the child¦785 and his¦790 mother¦789 and departed for Egypt¦795.
\v 15 \x + \xo 2:15: \xt Hos 11:1.\x*They stayed there¦798 until¦799 the death¦801 of Herod¦802, in order¦803 to fulfill¦804 what the Lord had said through¦810 the prophet¦812: “I called¦816 my¦819 son out of Egypt¦815.”
\s1 The killing of the children
\p
\v 16 When \add King\add* Herod¦821 realised that he had been tricked by the watchers of signs, he got very angry and gave orders that all the male children in Bethlehem¦838 and its districts that were two¦847 years old and younger be killed¦832, because that was the period that he had found out from the watchers of signs.
\p
\v 17 That fulfilled¦861 what had been spoken¦863 through¦866 the prophet¦869 Jeremiah which said:
\q1
\v 18 \x + \xo 2:18: \xt Jer 31:15.\x*The sound of great¦880 weeping and mourning¦879 was heard¦874 in Ramah;
\q1 …
\s1 Joseph's family return to Nazareth
\p
\q1 Rachel weeping for her children and she didn't want to be comforted¦890
\q2 because¦891 her children were no more.
\p
\v 19 After \add King\add* Herod¦897 died¦894, a messenger¦899 of the Lord appeared¦901 to Joseph¦906 in Egypt¦908 in a dream¦903
\v 20 and said, “Get up and take the child and his¦919 mother¦918 and go \add back\add* to the land of Israel, because¦926 the ones wanting to kill him have died.”
\v 21 So Joseph got up and took¦937 the child¦940 and his¦945 mother¦944 and went \add back\add* to Israel.
\p
\v 22 But when he heard¦953 that Archelaus was reigning¦957 over Judea instead¦961 of his¦965 father¦964 Herod¦966, and \add also\add* having been warning in a dream¦973, he left \add Judea\add* and went to the Galilee¦979 area.
\v 23 \x + \xo 2:23: \xt Mrk 1:24; Luk 2:39; Jn 1:45.\x*Once they got there, he settled into the town of Nazareth, so that what had been spoken¦991 through¦993 the prophets¦995 would be fulfilled¦989: “He will be called a Nazarene.”

\s1 John-the-Immerser's preaching
\r (Mrk. 1:1-8; Luk. 3:1-18; Jn 1:19-28)
\p
\v 1 That was the time when John-the-Immerser started preaching¦1008 in the Judean wilderness¦1011
\v 2 telling everyone,\x + \xo 3:2: \xt Mat 4:17; Mrk 1:15.\x* “Turn from your sins because¦1018 the kingdom¦1020 of heavens¦1022 is close.
\v 3 This is the man that the prophet¦1032 Isaiah was talking¦1033 about \add when he wrote\add*:\x + \xo 3:3: \xt Isa 40:3 (LXX).\x*
\q1 ‘The voice¦1034 of one shouting¦1035 in the wilderness¦1038
\q2 prepare the road for the master¦1042;
\q2 straighten¦1043 his¦1047 paths¦1046.’
\p
\v 4 \x + \xo 3:4: \xt 2Ki 1:8.\x*John¦1051 himself¦1048 wore clothes¦1054 made from \add coarse\add* camel¦1058 hair¦1057 with a leather¦1061 belt¦1060 around¦1062 his waist¦1064, and his food was locusts¦1072 and wild honey¦1074.
\v 5 \add People from\add* Jerusalem¦1080 and all Judea¦1084 and all of the regions¦1088 surrounding¦1088 the Jordan¦1090 River went out \add into the wilderness\add* to \add listen to\add* John
\v 6 and many confessed¦1099 their¦1102 sins¦1101 and asked him¦1098 to immerse¦1092 them in the river.
\p
\v 7 \x + \xo 3:7: \xt Mat 12:34; 23:33.\x*But when John saw many from the party¦1107 of the Pharisees and from the Sadduccee sect coming for immersion¦1113, he told them, “You brood of snakes, who warned¦1120 you all to flee from \add God's\add* severe¦1126 anger¦1126 that's coming?
\v 8 Turning from your sins should be accompanied by evidence that you've changed.
\v 9 \x + \xo 3:9: \xt Jn 8:33.\x*And don't¦1136 think that you can just tell yourselves¦1140 that you're descendants of Abraham, because¦1146 I can tell you that God¦1151 could turn these¦1155 stones¦1154 into descendants of Abraham.
\v 10 \x + \xo 3:10: \xt Mat 7:19.\x*The axe¦1165 has already¦1161 been placed at the base of the trees¦1170 ready to cut down any tree¦1174 that's not producing¦1176 good¦1178 fruit¦1177 and¦1180 then it'll be thrown¦1184 into the fire¦1183.
\v 11 I'm immersing people in water¦1192 as a sign that they're turning away from their sins, but there's another one coming¦1200 after¦1198 me who's greater than me—so much so that I'm not even worthy¦1207 to carry his sandals¦1209. He'll immerse you in the pure¦1216 spirit¦1215 and fire¦1218.
\v 12 He's already holding his fork so that he can clear¦1227 his threshing¦1229 floor¦1229—\add he'll work through the pile throwing it into the air where the breeze will carry\add* the chaff¦1242 away and he'll burn that with unquenchable fire¦1244, while the \add (heavier)\add* grains of wheat¦1234 will land in the pile to be brought into the barn.
\s1 Yeshua gets immersed in the river
\r (Mrk. 1:9-11; Luk. 3:21-22)
\p
\v 13 Then Yeshua¦1249 came down from Galilee¦1252 to John¦1258 at the Jordan¦1255 River to be immersed¦1260 by him¦1262.
\v 14 But John refused, saying¦1268, “It's me who needs to be immersed¦1274 by you, and yet you're¦1276 coming¦1277 to me?”
\p
\v 15 “\wj Just allow¦1300 it,\wj*” answered¦1280 Yeshua¦1283, “\wj because¦1291 we need to do what righteousness¦1298 requires.\wj*” So John immersed him.
\p
\v 16 As Yeshua¦1306 came up out of the water¦1312 after being immersed¦1303, the sky was opened¦1315 up and he saw God's spirit¦1323 coming down like a dove¦1333 and landing on him.
\v 17 \x + \xo 3:17: \xt Gen 22:2; Psa 2:7; Isa 42:1; Mat 12:18; 17:5; Mrk 1:11; Luk 9:35.\x*Then, wow, a voice¦1342 came from the sky and said, “This is my¦1357 son that I love and I'm pleased¦1362 with.”
\c 4
\s1 Yeshua is tempted by the devil
\r (Mrk. 1:12-13; Luk. 4:1-13)
\p
\v 1 \x + \xo 4:1: \xt Heb 2:18; 4:15.\x*Then Yeshua¦1368 was taken by the spirit¦1375 into the wilderness¦1372 to be tempted¦1379 by the devil¦1382.
\v 2 As he'd been fasting for forty days¦1385 (and nights¦1389), he was getting hungry,
\v 3 and the tempter¦1399 approached¦1395 him¦1402 and asked, “If you're¦1405 God's son, command some of these¦1413 stones¦1412 to turn into buns.”
\p
\v 4 \x + \xo 4:4: \xt Deu 8:3.\x*But Yeshua answered¦1418, “\wj It's written¦1423 in the scriptures that it's not just food that a person¦1430 needs to live, but¦1431 also all of God's message¦1435.\wj*”
\p
\v 5 Then the devil¦1444 took him to Jersualem, and stood¦1451 him on the highest point of the temple¦1458
\v 6 \x + \xo 4:6: \xt Psa 91:11-12.\x*and told him, “Throw yourself¦1469 down if you're¦1465 God's son, because¦1473 it's written¦1472 \add in the scriptures\add* that God will command¦1478 his¦1477 messengers to look after you and to carry¦1484 you in their arms so that you won't bash your¦1493 foot¦1492 on a rock.”
\p
\v 7 \x + \xo 4:7: \xt Deu 6:16.\x*“\wj But it's also written¦1499,\wj*” Yeshua¦1497 answered, “\wj that you¦1506 shouldn't test God¦1505 your¦1506 master¦1503.\wj*”
\p
\v 8 Then the devil¦1511 took him to a very high mountains¦1513 and showed him all the countries of the world¦1525 with all their¦1529 splendour,
\v 9 then told him¦1533, “I'll give all of these¦1534 to you if you get down and prostrate¦1542 yourself to me.”
\p
\v 10 \x + \xo 4:10: \xt Deu 6:13.\x*“\wj Go away, Satan¦1552,\wj*” Yeshua¦1548 replied, “\wj because¦1554 it's written¦1553 \add in the scriptures\add* that you should worship God¦1557 your¦1558 master¦1555 and should only serve him.\wj*”
\p
\v 11 Then the devil¦1569 left him and \add God's\add messengers came and looked after him.
\s1 Yeshua begins his ministry
\r (Mrk. 1:14-15; Luk. 4:14-15)
\p
\v 12 \x + \xo 4:12: \xt Mat 14:3; Mrk 6:17; Luk 3:19-20.\x*When Yeshua heard¦1577 that John¦1582 had been arrested, he¦1585 withdrew¦1585 up to Galilee¦1588.
\v 13 \x + \xo 4:13: \xt Jn 2:12.\x*He moved from Nazareth¦1592 across to Capernaum¦1598 beside the lake in the region¦1605 that had been given to the tribes of Zebulun and¦1607 Naftali
\v 14 so that what had been written by the prophet¦1616 Isaiah¦1614 would come true,
\q1
\v 15 \x + \xo 4:15-16: \xt Isa 9:1-2.\x*‘Land of Zebulun and land of Naftali,
\q2 the way¦1624 of the sea¦1625 beyond¦1626 the Jordan¦1628;
\q2 Galilee¦1629 of the non-Jews¦1632.
\q1
\v 16 The people¦1634 sitting in darkness¦1639
\q2 saw a powerful light,
\q1 and those sitting in a land under the shadow¦1656 of death¦1657
\q2 had a light rise over them.’
\p
\v 17 \x + \xo 4:17: \xt Mat 3:2.\x*From then onwards, Yeshua¦1666 started preaching¦1667 and¦1668 telling people to turn from their sins because¦1672 the kingdom¦1674 of heavens¦1676 is close.
\s1 Yeshua calls his first four followers
\r (Mrk. 1:16-20; Luk. 5:1-11)
\p
\v 18 As he walked beside¦1682 Lake Galilee¦1686, he saw two brothers¦1689, Simon¦1690 (later nicknamed Peter) and Andrew¦1696, throwing their net¦1701 into the sea because¦1706 they were fishermen¦1708.
\v 19 “\wj Come and follow me,\wj*” Yeshua told them, “\wj and I'll make you¦1717 fishers¦1720 of people¦1721.\wj*”
\v 20 So they¦1729 left their nets¦1727 immediately¦1724 and followed¦1729 after¦1730 him¦1730.
\p
\v 21 Going on a bit further, he saw¦1734 two other¦1735 brothers¦1737, Jacob¦1738 and John¦1744, in the boat¦1751 getting their nets¦1759 ready along with their father¦1755 Zebedee, and Yeshua also called¦1762 the two of them.
\v 22 So they¦1775 too immediately¦1766 left the boat¦1769 and their¦1774 father¦1773 and followed¦1775 after¦1776 him¦1776.
\s1 Yeshua's healing is very popular
\r (Luk. 6:17-19)
\p
\v 23 \x + \xo 4:23: \xt Mat 9:35; Mrk 1:39.\x*Then Yeshua¦1781 went around¦1778 all of Galilee¦1788, teaching¦1791 in their¦1797 Jewish¦1796 meeting¦1796 halls¦1796 and proclaiming¦1800 the good¦1802 message¦1802 about the kingdom¦1804, and healing¦1806 all the diseases¦1808 and sicknesses¦1811 of the people¦1814
\v 24 and the news¦1820 about this went¦1817 all the way¦1817 up to Syria.
\v 25 Large crowds¦1854 from Galilee¦1858 and Decapolis and Jerusalem¦1862, and from all of Judea¦1864 and even beyond¦1866 the Jordan¦1868 River, followed¦1852 after¦1853 Yeshua.
\c 5
\s1 Yeshua's sermon on the hillside
\r (Luk. 6:20-23)
\p
\v 1 After seeing all the crowds¦1872, Yeshua climbed up a hill, and when he sat¦1878 down, his¦1885 apprentices¦1884 approached¦1881 him
\v 2 and he taught¦1891 them:
\p
\v 3 “\wj Those who are poor in the spirit¦1899 are blessed, because¦1900 the kingdom¦1904 of the heavens¦1906 is theirs.\wj*
\p
\v 4 \x + \xo 5:4: \xt Isa 61:2.\x*“\wj Those who are mourning¦1909 are blessed, because¦1911 they¦1912 will be comforted¦1913.\wj*

\s1 Yeshua heals a Roman's slave
\r (Luk. 7:1-10)
\p
\v 5 When Yeshua arrived in Capernaum¦4230, a \add Roman\add* army commander approached¦4231 him and begged him,
\v 6 saying¦4239, “Master¦4240, I have a slave who's paralysed¦4248 and¦4238 had to kept in bed because he's being¦4250 badly tormented¦4250.”
\p
\v 7 “\wj I'll come¦4259 and heal him,\wj*” Yeshua answered.
\p
\v 8 “But master¦4270,” the commander replied, “I'm not worthy¦4273 that you¦4279 should come¦4279 to my house, but¦4280 just give the command and¦4285 my slave will be healed¦4286,
\v 9 because I'm also a man¦4293 given a position under authority¦4296 with soldiers¦4301 under me, and I tell this one, ‘Come here,’ and he comes, and tell my¦4316 slave¦4315, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.
\p
\v 10 Yeshua¦4324 was amazed when he¦4328 heard¦4321 that and¦4326 said¦4327 to his followers¦4329 \add around him\add*, “\wj I can assure you¦4333 that I haven't discovered faith¦4338 like this from any Israeli.\wj*
\v 11 \x + \xo 8:11: \xt Luk 13:29.\x*\wj I'm telling you¦4347 that many people from all over the world will come and join Abraham¦4358 and Isaac¦4360 and Jacob¦4362 at the table in the kingdom¦4365 of the heavens¦4367,\wj*

\v 13 Then he said¦4390 to the commander, “\wj Go then and it will happen according to your faith,\wj*” and his slave was healed¦4404 that very moment.
\s1 Yeshua heals the people
\r (Mrk. 1:29-34; Luk. 4:38-41)
\p
\v 14 When Yeshua¦4436 came to Peter's house¦4439, he saw¦4441 Peter's mother-in-law¦4443 lying in bed with the fever¦4447.
\v 15 Yeshua touched¦4449 her hand¦4451 and the fever¦4457 left her. Then she¦4459 got up and looked after her guest.
\p
\v 16 In the evening¦4465, the people brought¦4468 many who were possessed¦4470 by evil spirits and Yeshua drove out the spirits with a command and healed¦4482 all of them that were sick¦4480.
\v 17 This fulfilled¦4484 what the prophet¦4490 Isaiah had written: ‘He took¦4497 our sickness¦4495 and¦4498 bore our diseases¦4500.’\x + \xo 8:17: \xt Isa 53:4.\x*
\s1 Some wanted to follow Yeshua

\p
\v 18 When Yeshua¦4505 saw the crowd¦4508 around¦4510 him, he told \add his apprentices\add* to take him across¦4516 to the other side \add of the lake\add*.
\v 19 One of the teachers of the law came up to Yeshua and told him¦4522, “Teacher¦4523, I'll follow¦4524 you wherever¦4526 you go.”
\p
\v 20 “\wj Foxes¦4536 have burrows¦4537,\wj*” said Yeshua¦4534, “\wj and¦4539 birds¦4541 have their nests¦4544, but¦4546 humankind's child doesn't \add even\add* have a place to lay his head.\wj*”
\p
\v 21 Another one of his followers¦4559 said¦4562 to him¦4563, “\add I'll follow you, Master¦4564, but first¦4567 let me wait until I can bury¦4570\f + \fr 8:21 \ft It's not certain from either the text or the context whether this person meant that their father had just died (less likely, perhaps, because they probably wouldn't have been there at all), or that they wanted to delay until their (presumably, elderly) father passed away before following Yeshua.\f* my¦4573 father.”
\p
\v 22 “\wj Follow after¦4581 me,\wj*” Yeshua¦4576 responded, “\wj and leave¦4583 the dead to bury¦4586 the dead by themselves¦4588.\wj*”
\s1 Yeshua commands the wind
\r (Mrk. 4:35-41; Luk. 8:22-25)
\p
\v 23 Then Yeshua and his¦4600 apprentices¦4599 followed¦4596 him and got into the boat¦4595 \add and launched it\add*.
\v 24 Then wow, a huge storm¦4603 rose up on the lake¦4608 and the waves¦4616 started coming into the boat¦4611, but¦4618 Yeshua was asleep.
\v 25 They woke him¦4627 up and pleaded, “Master¦4629, save¦4630 us, we're going to drown.”
\p
\v 26 “\wj What are you worried about,\wj*”, asked Yeshua, “\wj you who don't have much faith¦4639.\wj*” Then he stood up and told the winds¦4645 and the water to stop, and the lake¦4649 became¦4651 very calm.
\p
\v 27 The people¦4656 were astonished and asked, “What kind of man¦4659 is this that the winds¦4667 and the lake¦4670 just do what he says?”
\s1 Yeshua banishes demons into a herd of pigs
\r (Mrk. 5:1-20; Luk. 8:26-39)
\p
\v 28 And when Yeshua arrived at the country of the Gadarenes¦4688 on the other side \add of the lake\add*, he was met by two¦4692 very dangerous¦4698 demon-possessed¦4693 men who were coming¦4697 out of the cemetary. Because of them, some \add people\add* weren't able to travel on that road.
\v 29 Suddenly the two men yelled¦4711 out saying¦4713, “Son of God¦4721, what's the connection between us and you? Have you come here to cause us pain before¦4728 the \add designated\add* time¦4729?”
\p
\v 30 Now there was a herd of many pigs grazing not far away from them,
\v 31 and the demons¦4744 begged Yeshua saying¦4747, “If you¦4749 do drive us out, send¦4751 us into the herd of pigs.”
\p
\v 32 And he said¦4762 to them, “Depart!” So they came out and went¦4771 away into the pigs, and next thing all the herd rushed¦4782 down the bank into the lake¦4794 and drowned in the water¦4801.
\p
\v 33 Then the men who had been grazing them took off, and when they got to the city¦4810 they reported¦4811 everything, including what had happened to the demon-possessed¦4817 men.
\v 34 Soon all the city¦4822 came¦4823 out to meet with Yeshua¦4829, and when they found him they asked him to leave their¦4840 region¦4839.

\s1 Yeshua forgives and heals a paralysed man
\r (Mrk. 2:1-12; Luk. 5:17-26)
\p
\v 1 So Yeshua got into a boat¦4845 and¦4849 crossed¦4848 back over to his own city¦4855 \add of Capernaum\add*.
\v 2 Some people there brought a paralysed¦4861 man to him lying on a stretcher. And when Yeshua¦4868 saw their¦4871 faith¦4870, he said¦4872 to the man, “Son, be encouraged. Your¦4881 sins¦4883 are forgiven¦4877.”
\p
\v 3 Immediately some of the law teachers¦4889 said¦4890 among¦4892 themselves¦4893, “This man¦4894 presumes to be God.”
\p
\v 4 But Yeshua¦4900 knew their¦4903 thoughts¦4902 and said¦4904, “Why are you thinking evil¦4910 things in your¦4914 hearts¦4913?
\v 5 Do you think it's easier¦4918 to say, ‘Your¦4923 sins¦4926 are forgiven¦4922,’ or to say, ‘Stand up and walk¦4932’?
\v 6 But so that you will know that humankind's child has the authority¦4938 here on earth¦4949 to forgive¦4950 sins¦4951,” he said, “stand up, take¦4959 your stretcher, and go to your house¦4968.”
\p
\v 7 Then the man stood up and went¦4972 off to his¦4976 house¦4975.
\v 8 The crowds¦4981 were struck with fear after seeing this, yet they¦4985 praised God¦4987 for giving such authority¦4990 to men.
\s1 Yeshua calls Matthew and they dine with sinners
\r (Mark 2:13-17; Luke 5:27-32)
\p
\v 9 And as Yeshua¦4998 was leaving there¦4999, he saw¦5000 a man¦5001 called¦5009 Matthew \add (also known as Levi)\add* sitting¦5002 in the tax¦5005 office¦5005. He said to Matthew, “Follow me.” And he got¦5016 up¦5016 and followed¦5017 him.
\p
\v 10 \x + \xo 9:10-11: \xt Luk 15:1-2.\x*Later when Yeshua was eating at \add Matthew's\add* house¦5028, many tax¦5033 collectors¦5033 and sinners¦5036 came¦5021 in and sat at the table together with Yeshua and his¦5022 disciples.
\v 11 Some of the Pharisee¦5051 party¦5051 noticed this and said to his¦5056 disciples, “How come your¦5072 teacher¦5071 eats with tax¦5064 collectors¦5064 and sinners¦5067?”
\p
\v 12 But Yeshua heard¦5077 this and said¦5078, “People who are well don't¦5080 need a doctor¦5085—only the ones with problems do.
\v 13 \x + \xo 9:13: a \xt Mat 12:7; \xo b \xt Hos 6:6.\x*So go and¦5099 find out the meaning of this: I like mercy not sacrifice¦5101. Because it's sinners¦5109 that I came¦5104 to call, not those \add considered\add* righteous¦5106.”
\s1 Yeshua is asked about fasting
\r (Mark 2:18-22; Luke 5:33-39)
\p
\v 14 Then the disciples of John¦5117 approached¦5113 Yeshua and said, “How come that we¦5121 and the Pharisees fast regularly, but your¦5132 disciples don't¦5133 fast?”
\p
\v 15 And Yeshua¦5139 replied to them, “Surely the groomsmen aren't sad while the groom is with them? But the time will come when the groom has to leave them and¦5170 then they¦5172 will fast.
\p
\v 16 No one patches old clothes with new material because¦5189 the patch will shrink and¦5196 the clothes would end up with a worse¦5197 hole.
\v 17 And they don't¦5209 put new wine into an old container, otherwise the container could split and be ruined and the wine would be lost. Rather they put new wine into a new container and both survive.”
\s1 Yeshua raises a dead girl and heals a woman from bleeding
\r (Mark 5:21-43; Luke 8:40-56)
\p
\v 18 While Yeshua was speaking¦5248 to them, an official came and bowed to him saying¦5257, “My¦5261 daughter¦5260 has just passed away, but come¦5265 and put your¦5269 hand¦5268 on her and she¦5273 will revive.
\p
\v 19 So Yeshua¦5277 and his¦5284 disciples got up and followed¦5279 him.
\p
\v 20 Just then a woman¦5287 who had been bleeding internally for twelve¦5290 years¦5291 came up behind¦5293 Yeshua and touched¦5294 the edge of his¦5299 robe
\v 21 because she had told herself¦5303 that if she could just touch¦5306 his¦5310 robe, she would be healed¦5311.
\p
\v 22 Yeshua¦5315 turned¦5316 and saw her and said, “Be encouraged, daughter¦5323, your¦5327 faith¦5326 has healed you.” And the woman¦5333 was healed that very moment.
\p
\v 23 Now when Yeshua¦5341 went into the house¦5344 of the ruler¦5346, he saw the funeral musicians and the distressed¦5354 people
\v 24 and he said, “Go away. The girl¦5363 hasn't died¦5361—she's sleeping¦5365.” But they ridiculed¦5367 him.
\v 25 However when the crowd¦5378 was moved out, he went in and took¦5381 her¦5386 hand¦5384, and the girl¦5390 got up.
\v 26 Then the news¦5394 of this spread all around that region.
\s1 Yeshua heals two blind men
\p
\v 27 As Yeshua¦5407 left the ruler's home, two¦5411 blind¦5412 men¦5412 followed¦5409 him¦5410 and¦5415 called out, “Have mercy¦5417 on us, son of David¦5421.”
\p
\v 28 When he went into the house¦5430, the blind¦5437 men¦5437 went to him and Yeshua¦5442 said to them, “Do you believe¦5443 that I'm able to do this?”
\p They replied, “Yes, master¦5455.”
\p
\v 29 Then he touched¦5457 their¦5461 eyes¦5460 saying¦5463, “Let it be done to you in line with your¦5468 faith¦5467.”
\v 30 Then their¦5475 eyes¦5477 were healed and Yeshua¦5484 told them, “Don't let anyone know about this.”
\p
\v 31 But after they¦5492 had departed, the men told the whole region about him¦5493.
\s1 Yeshua heals a man who couldn't talk
\p
\v 32 As they¦5503 were leaving, some people brought¦5503 a man to Yeshua who was demon-possessed¦5507 and unable to talk.
\v 33 After the demon¦5511 was cast out, the man¦5514 was able to speak and the crowds¦5518 were amazed saying¦5519, “Never before has anything like this happened in Israel.”
\v 34 \x + \xo 9:34: \xt Mat 10:25; 12:24; Mrk 3:22; Luk 11:15.\x*But the Pharisees said, “He casts out demons with the help of the ruler¦5534 of the demons.”

\v 37 \x + \xo 9:37-38: \xt Luk 10:2.\x*He said to his¦5600 disciples, “The harvest¦5603 is large, but there's not enough workers¦5607.

\v 2 These are the names¦5652 of the twelve¦5649: Simon¦5656 (nicknamed Peter) and his brother Andrew¦5661, Jacob¦5666 and his brother John¦5671 (the sons of Zebedee¦5669),

\s1 Yeshua and John-the-Immerser
\r (Luk. 7:18-35)
\p
\v 1 When Yeshua¦6500 had finished¦6498 giving those instructions to his¦6505 twelve¦6503 apprentices¦6504, he \add also\add* left there¦6507 and went to teach¦6509 and preach in the Jewish cities¦6514.
\p
\v 2 Then John¦6518, who was in prison¦6522, heard¦6519 about what the messiah¦6527 was doing, he sent¦6528 some of his¦6533 apprentices¦6532
\v 3 to ask Yesha, “Are you¦6536 the promised one, or should we¦6543 be waiting¦6543 for someone else?”
\p
\v 4 “\wj \add Well,\add*\wj*” Yeshua¦6548 answered¦6545, “\wj go and tell John¦6554 everything that you're hearing¦6556 and seeing¦6558:\wj*

\v 6 \wj The person who's not embarrassed by me will be blessed¦6576.\wj*”
\p
\v 7 As John's apprentices left, Yeshua started talking¦6591 to the crowd¦6593 about John: “\wj What was it that you¦6597 all went out to the wilderness¦6601 to see¦6602?

\v 8 \wj Yes, what did you¦6610 all go out to see¦6612? A man¦6613 wearing¦6623 fine clothes? People in palaces wear fine clothes.\wj
\v 9 \wj So why did you go out \add there\add*? To see¦6638 a prophet? Yes, I'm telling you that \add he is a prophet\add*, and even more important¦6643 than the prophets.\wj*

\s1 Cities that rejected the messiah

\v 20 Then Yeshua began¦6819 deriding¦6822 the cities¦6824 that he had done most of his¦6833 miracles¦6832 in, because¦6834 they hadn't turned from their sins.

\p
\v 9 After leaving that place, Yeshua went into the Jewish¦7225 meeting¦7225 hall¦7225,
\v 10 and¦7233 look, there was a man¦7229 there with a clawed fist. So the people there asked¦7238 Yeshua if it¦7243 was permitted¦7243 to heal people on the rest days¦7245.
\p
\v 11 \x + \xo 12:11: \xt Luk 14:5.\x*“\wj Which of you,\wj*” Jesus responded, “\wj if you owned a single sheep¦7268 and it fell into a pit on a rest day, wouldn't then grab hold of it and lift it out?\wj*

\v 15 Yeshua¦7336 knew what they were trying to do, so he left that place. A lot of people followed¦7341 along after¦7342 him and he healed¦7346 them all
\v 16 but warned¦7356 them not to reveal who he¦7356 was

\s1 The meaning/salvation of parable concerning the planting
\r (Mrk. 4:13-20; Luk. 8:11-15)
\p
\v 18 “\wj So now listen concerning the parable¦8478 about the person spreading seed.\wj*
\v 19 \wj Everyone¦8482 who hears the message¦8485 about the kingdom¦8487 and doesn't understand¦8491 it, the evil¦8494 one comes and snatches¦8496 what was sown in that person's heart¦8502. That's the seed that landed by the path.\wj*
\v 20 \wj The seed that landed on the rocky¦8516 ground, that's the person who hears the message¦8522 and¦8525 is immediately¦8526 happy to accept it¦8531,\wj*
\v 21 \wj but doesn't have any roots of their own so it's just fleeting—they stumble¦8551 as soon as there's any difficulties or persecution¦8545 because¦8546 of the message¦8548.\wj*
\v 22 \wj The seed the landed among¦8554 the thorns¦8556 is the person who hears the message, but the worries of the time and the seduction¦8574 of wealth chokes out the message and it becomes¦8583 unfruitful¦8582.\wj*
\v 23 \wj The seed that landed on the good¦8590 soil is the person who hears the message¦8598 and understands¦8602 it¦8607 and goes on to bear fruit¦8607—some people producing¦8609 a hundred¦8612 times more, some sixty¦8615 times, and some thirty¦8618 times.\wj*”
\s1 The parable about the bad wheat
\p
\v 24 Then Yeshua told them another¦8619 parable¦8620, saying¦8623, “\wj The kingdom¦8626 of the heavens¦8628 is like a farmer who's planted good¦8632 seed in his¦8639 field¦8637.\wj*
\v 25 \wj But the while they were all sleeping¦8643, his enemy¦8649 came¦8646 and spread black-grained ‘wheat’ seeds around his wheat field and left again.\wj*
\v 26 \wj Then when the wheat grew and¦8665 produced¦8667 grains, the \add poisonous\add* ‘wheat’ could also be seen¦8669.\wj*
\v 27 \wj The farmer's slave¦8676 came and told him¦8681, ‘Master¦8682, wasn't it¦8694 \em good¦8684\em* wheat seed that you¦8686 planted? So why is there so much false wheat?’\wj*
\v 28 \wj ‘An enemy¦8701 must have done this,’ the farmer replied. ‘So should we¦8717 go and pull out the bad stuff,’ asked the slaves¦8707.\wj*
\v 29 \wj ‘No,’ said the farmer, ‘because pulling that out might also pull up some of the wheat¦8737 plants.\wj*
\v 30 \wj ‘Let them all grown¦8741 together, and then at harvest time¦8752 I can just tell the harvesters to pull the false wheat plants out first¦8759 and put then in bundles¦8766 to be incinerated, and then harvest the wheat to go into my¦8781 barn.’\wj* ”
\s1 The parable about the small mustard seed
\r (Mrk. 4:30-32; Luk. 13:18-19)
\p
\v 31 Another¦8782 one of his parables¦8783 went like this: “\wj The kingdom¦8791 of the heavens¦8793 is like a mustard¦8795 seed that a man¦8798 planted in his field¦8802.\wj*
\v 32 \wj Even though it's a very small¦8805 seed, it grows larger than \add most\add* garden¦8818 plants¦8818 and becomes¦8821 such a large bush that birds¦8826 even come¦8824 and nest in its branches¦8834.\wj*”
\s1 The parable about the yeast
\r (Luk. 13:20-21)
\p
\v 33 In another parable¦8837, Yeshua said, “\wj The kingdom¦8845 of the heavens¦8847 is like yeast, which a woman¦8851 took and hid it in a month's worth of flour¦8855, and eventually all of it rose.\wj*”
\s1 The reason Yeshua used parables
\r (Mrk. 4:33-34)
\p
\v 34 Yeshua¦8866 told all these¦8862 things¦8862 to the crowds¦8870 in the form of parables, in fact he said nothing¦8874 that wasn't a parable,
\v 35 \x + \xo 13:35: \xt Psa 78:2.\x*so that that what had been \add written\add* by the prophet¦8886 would be fulfilled¦8880:
\q1 ‘I will be saying¦8887 things¦8894 that have been hidden¦8895 since the creation of the world¦8898.’
\s1 Yeshua explains about the false wheat
\p
\v 36 Then Yeshua left the crowd¦8902 and went into the house¦8907. His¦8917 apprentices¦8916 followed him in and asked him for the interpretation of the parable¦8923 about the poisonous black wheat in the field¦8927.
\p
\v 37 “\wj The farmer spreading the good¦8936 seed,\wj*” Jesus answered¦8930, “\wj is humankind's child,\wj*
\v 38 \wj and the field¦8945 is the world¦8948 and the good¦8951 seeds are the heirs to the kingdom¦8958. The false wheat seeds are the disciples of the evil¦8967 one,\wj*
\v 39 \wj and the enemy¦8970 who planted them in the devil¦8977. The harvest¦8980 is at the end of this age, and the harvesters are \add God's\add* messengers.\wj*
\v 40 \wj Therefore¦8991 at the end of this age, the false wheat plants will be gathered¦8992 and¦8996 incinerated.\wj*
\v 41 \wj Humankind's child will be sending¦9011 out his messengers to remove all the temptations¦9027 out of his kingdom¦9023, and all those who don't obey \add God's\add* law,\wj*
\v 42 \wj and they¦9034 will throw¦9034 them into the incinerator, and there¦9042 will be crying and much anguish.\wj*
\v 43 \wj Then the godly people will be shining¦9055 \add as bright as\add* the sun¦9058 in their¦9064 father's¦9063 kingdom¦9061. Whoever is interested to hear¦9069, let them listen.
\s1 The parable about the treasure in the field
\p
\v 44 “\wj The kingdom¦9075 of the heavens¦9078 is like a field that had had treasure hidden¦9080 in it. When someone found¦9085 the treasure, they hid it again, and with great excitement went and sold everything they had so they could buy that field.\wj*
\s1 The parable about the valuable pearl
\p
\v 45 “\wj Also the kingdom¦9110 of the heavens¦9112 is like a trader wanting to buy beautiful¦9116 pearls¦9117,\wj*
\v 46 \wj and when they found¦9119 one outstanding pearl, they went and sold everything they hadso they could buy that pearl.\wj*
\s1 The parable about the dragnet
\p
\v 47 “\wj Also the kingdom¦9138 of the heavens¦9140 is like a dragnet¦9141 that was thrown¦9142 into the lake¦9145 and¦9146 picked up everything¦9148 from under the water.\wj*
\v 48 \wj When it was full, they pulled¦9155 it up onto the beach and sat¦9163 and sorted the catch—throwing the good¦9167 catch into containers¦9171 and throwing out the bad¦9174 stuff.\wj*
\v 49 \wj It'll be just like that at the end of this age—\add God's\add* messengers will be coming¦9187 out and¦9192 will separate evil¦9195 people from the godly people,\wj*
\v 50 \wj and they¦9201 will throw¦9201 the evil ones into the incinerator. There¦9209 will be crying and great anguish.\wj*
\p
\v 51 “\wj Did you all understand¦9222 all of that?\wj*
\p “Yes,” his apprentices answered.
\p
\v 52 Then he said to them, “\wj Because¦9235 of this, every¦9237 teacher who's been trained¦9239 about the kingdom¦9244 of the heavens¦9247 is like a person who's a home¦9252 owner¦9252 who gives presents of both new and old things of out their valuables.\wj*”
\s1 Those from Nazareth cannot accept the messiah
\r (Mrk. 6:1-6; Luk. 4:16-30)
\p
\v 53 After Yeshua¦9268 had finished¦9266 explaining the parables¦9270, he left that place
\v 54 and went to his hometown¦9279 \add of Nazareth\add* and taught¦9281 the people in the Jewish¦9285 meeting¦9285 hall¦9285. They were amazed¦9289 at his teaching¦9281, asking \add each other\add*, “Where did this fellow get his wisdom¦9300 and his ability to do miracles¦9304?
\v 55 Isn't he the son of Joseph, the carpenter¦9310? Don't we know his mother¦9315 Maria¦9318 and his brothers¦9322 Jacob¦9324 and Joseph and Simon¦9330 and Judas?
\v 56 Aren't his¦9336 sisters¦9335 still here in town? So where¦9342 did he¦9334 get all these¦9345 abilities?”
\v 57 \x + \xo 13:57: \xt Jn 4:44.\x*As a result, they didn't have any respect for him.
\p But Yeshua¦9355 said¦9356 to them, “\wj A prophet¦9360 is not dishonoured¦9361 except¦9362 in his own hometown¦9367 and among his own household¦9372.\wj*”
\v 58 So he didn't do many miracles¦9378 there¦9377 because¦9380 of their¦9385 unbelief¦9383.
\c 14
\s1 The beheading of John-the-Immerser
\r (Mrk. 6:14-29; Luk. 9:7-9)
\p
\v 1 Around that time¦9392, \add King\add* Herod¦9394 the Tetrach heard¦9393 the news¦9398 about Yeshua¦9399
\v 2 and he said¦9401 to his¦9404 slaves, “This must be John-the-Immerser having come back from the dead¦9419 and so that's why he can do all these miracles¦9424!”
\p
\v 3 \x + \xo 14:3-4: \xt Luk 3:19-20.\x*Herod¦9430 said this because he had previously had John¦9434 arrested and put in prison¦9441 because of Herodias, his¦9450 brother¦9449 Philip's wife¦9446.
\v 4 John¦9455 had been saying¦9451 that it was against God's law for Herod to take his brother's wife.
\v 5 Herod had been wanting¦9464 to have John executed, but he was afraid¦9468 of the crowd¦9470 because¦9472 they considered John to be a prophet¦9474.
\p
\v 6 However at Herod's¦9484 birthday¦9477 celebration¦9477, Herodias' daughter¦9487 had danced¦9485 in the middle of them all and¦9495 had pleased¦9496 Herod so much
\v 7 that he promised¦9502 with an oath to give¦9504 her anything that she requested¦9509.
\p
\v 8 The young woman was urged¦9512 on by her¦9516 mother¦9515 to tell Herod that she¦9520 wanted the head of John-the-Immerser on a plate.
\p
\v 9 The king¦9533 was upset, but because¦9534 of his oaths¦9537 in front of the other guests, he commanded¦9542 it to be so
\v 10 and sent¦9545 \add his soldiers\add* to behead¦9546 John¦9548 in prison¦9551.
\v 11 So then his¦9556 head was brought in on a plate and given¦9561 to the young woman who then took it to her¦9568 mother¦9567.
\v 12 \add Hearing the news,\add* John's followers¦9572 went \add to the prison\add* and collected his¦9573 body and buried¦9580 it. Then they¦9585 went and told Yeshua¦9587.
\s1 The feeding of 5,000 families
\r (Mrk. 6:30-44; Luk. 9:10-17; Jn 6:1-14)
\p
\v 13 When Yeshua¦9592 heard \add what had happened to John\add*, he got a boat¦9596 to take him to a quiet¦9598 place¦9599 by himself¦9601, but the crowds¦9605 from the cities¦9612 heard about it, and followed¦9606 him around the shore of the lake on foot¦9609.
\v 14 So when he got out of the boat, he saw¦9617 a large crowd¦9619 of people and he felt compassion¦9622 towards them, and he healed¦9629 the sick¦9632 people \add that they had brought\add*.
\p
\v 15 As evening¦9634 was approaching¦9637, his followers¦9641 came up and asked, “This place¦9647 is quite isolated and it's already¦9651 late. Send the people back into the villages¦9663 so they¦9665 can buy themselves¦9666 something to eat.”
\p
\v 16 “\wj Oh, there's no need to send them away,\wj*” Jesus answered. “\wj you all give¦9677 them something¦9677 to eat¦9680.\wj*”
\p
\v 17 “We don't¦9686 have anything¦9687 here” they¦9682 responded, “except¦9690 for five¦9692 buns and¦9694 two¦9695 \add cooked\add* fish.”
\p
\v 18 “\wj Bring them here to me,” Yeshua instructed,
\v 19 then he told the crowds to sit down on the grass¦9720. He took the five buns and two fish and looking up to the sky, he blessed¦9735 \add God/the food/the people???\add*, broke¦9738 the buns and gave the pieces to his apprentices to distribute to the crowds.
\v 20 Everyone there ate¦9750 enough to be full, and then \add the apprentices\add* picked up twelve¦9760 baskets¦9761 of left-over bread.
\v 21 There were about¦9769 five¦9770 thousand¦9770 families there.
\s1 Yeshua and Peter walk on the lake
\r (Mrk. 6:45-52; Jn 6:15-21)
\p
\v 22 Straight after that, Yeshua instructed his apprentices¦9783 to board¦9785 the boat¦9788 and to head back to the other side of the lake while he dismissed the crowds¦9799.
\v 23 He sent¦9801 them all back to their homes, then climbed up a hill by himself¦9809 to pray.
\v 24 By then the boat¦9819 was in the middle of the lake¦9829, but it was being¦9832 beaten by the waves¦9835 because¦9838 a strong wind¦9841 had come up.
\p
\v 25 In the early hours of the morning, Yeshua went out to them on the lake¦9862, walking¦9857 on the surface.
\v 26 When his apprentices¦9866 saw him¦9869 coming over the lake¦9876, they¦9887 were worried thinking it was a ghost¦9881 and¦9883 yelling out in fear¦9886.
\p
\v 27 But Yeshua¦9893 answered them immediately¦9888 saying¦9897, “\wj Be brave, I'm here, don't¦9902 worry.\wj*”
\p
\v 28 “Master¦9911,” called Peter, “if it's you, command¦9916 me to come¦9919 to you on the lake.”
\p
\v 29 “\wj Come!\wj*” he said¦9928. So Peter climbed \add over the back\add* of the boat¦9934 and started walking across the lake towards Yeshua¦9947,
\v 30 but when he looked \add around\add* at the wind¦9951, he lost his nerve and started sinking and yelled¦9959 out, “Master¦9961, save¦9962 me!”
\v 31 Immediately Yeshua¦9968 stretched¦9969 out his¦9973 hand¦9971 and took¦9972 hold of Peter and said to him, “\wj Your faith¦9978 is weak because¦9979 why did you doubt¦9981?\wj*”
\p
\v 32 Then as soon as the two of them climbed into the boat¦9988, the wind¦9991 died¦9989 down
\v 33 and everyone in the boat¦9996 kneeled down in front of Yeshua saying¦10000, “You certainly must be God's son!”
\s1 The sick are healed just by touching Yeshua's clothes
\r (Mrk. 6:53-56)
\p
\v 34 So then they¦10009 finished crossing¦10008 the lake and¦10014 got out at Gennesaret.
\v 35 The people there recognised¦10019 Yeshua and sent¦10026 news to all the surrounding¦10030 region¦10030. So the people brought¦10033 all their sick¦10037 relatives to him
\v 36 and begged him even to just let them touch¦10044 the edge of his¦10049 robe because everyone who did that was healed.
