\v 1 \add ≈Now\add* King David¦155592 had become very old, and \add ≈he couldn't keep warm even when covered¦155596 with blankets\add*,
\v 2 \add ≈so\add* his servants¦155604 \add ≈suggested\add*, “\add ≈Allow us search for a young¦155608 woman¦155608 who can wait on you and take care of your needs¦155605. She can sleep beside you and keep our\add* master, the king, warm.”
\v 3 \add ≈So¦155623\add* they searched¦155623 \add ≈throughout\add* Israel and found¦155629 a beautiful¦155625 young¦155624 woman¦155624 called Avishag (a Shunammite) and brought¦155634 her to the king¦155636.

\p
\v 5 Then¦155651 \add David and\add* Haggit's son Adoniyyah \add ≈promoted himself¦155655\add* saying, “I, myself, will reign.” He \add ≈acquired\add* a chariot¦155661 and horsemen¦155662 and fifty¦155663 men who ran \add ≈along in front\add*.\x + \xo 1:5: \xt 2Sam 3:4.\x*
\v 6 \add @Haggit\add* had given birth to him after¦155686 Avshalom. He was \add ≈a good-looker\add*, \add but\add* his father¦155671 \add ≈had never disciplined\add* him \add or ever\add* asked, “Why did you do that?”
\v 7 \add ≈He had spoken\add* with Tseruyah's son Yoav¦155692 and the priest¦155698 Evyatar and they¦155689 had \add both\add* \add ≈agreed to support¦155699\add* \add *him\add*.

\p
\v 9 Then¦155722 Adoniyyah sacrificed¦155722 sheep¦155724 and cattle¦155726 and fattened¦155726 calves near the Zohelet stone (which¦155730 is beside¦155732 Eyn-Rogel), and he \add ≈invited\add* all his brothers¦155740 (the king's sons¦155741), and all the men¦155745 of Yehudah \add including\add* the king's servants¦155747.

\p
\v 11 Then¦155765 Natan \add ≈asked\add* Shelomoh's mother¦155772 Batsheva, “Haven't you¦155777 heard¦155777 that Haggit's son Adoniyyah \add ≈has made himself king¦155779\add*, and¦155784 our¦155784 master¦155784 David¦155785 doesn't \add even\add* \add ≈realise\add*?\x + \xo 1:11: \xt 2Sam 12:24.\x*
\v 12 \add ≈So¦155789\add* please¦155792 let me advise you now \add ≈so that you can save your own life and that of your son Shelomoh\add* \add (Solomon¦155802)\add*.
\v 13 Go and \add ≈ask\add* King David¦155810, ‘My master¦155816 the king, didn't you promise your female¦155819 servant, saying, “Surely your son Shelomoh will reign¦155825 after¦155826 me, and he will sit on my throne¦155831?” \add ≈So why has Adoniyyah become¦155833 king\add*?’
\v 14 Then while you're still¦155838 there talking¦155839 to the king, I'll come in behind you and \add ≈confirm¦155847 what you said\add*.”
\p
\v 15 \add ≈So¦155852\add* Batsheva \add ≈went¦155852 to the king's bedroom where\add* Avishag (the Shunammite) was attending \add *him\add* \add ≈in his old age\add*.
\v 16 Batsheva bowed¦155870 \add ≈low to show respect\add* to the king, and he \add ≈asked her what she wanted\add*.
\p
\v 17 “My master¦155884,” she \add ≈replied\add*, “you yourself \add ≈promised\add* to your female servant¦155889 \add ≈in front of\add* your God¦155888 Yahweh¦155884 that your son Shelomoh \add ≈would be the one to reign¦155894 after¦155895 you and sit¦155897 on your\add* throne¦155900.
\v 18 \add ≈But¦155902\add* now, listen, Adoniyyah \add ≈has become¦155905 king\add* \add instead\add*, and you \add ≈haven't even been told about it\add*.
\v 19 He's sacrificing¦155912 \add ≈many\add* oxen and calves and sheep¦155916, and he invited¦155931 the priest¦155924 Evyatar, and Yoav¦155925 the commander¦155926 of the army, and all your sons¦155921 \add ≈except for\add* your servant¦155929 Shelomoh.
\v 20 \add ≈So¦155933\add* \add now\add* \add ≈everyone's waiting to see what you'll do\add*, my master the king. \add ≈They¦155939 want you to make it clearly known who'll be the king on the throne¦155947 after¦155951 you\add*.
\v 21 \add ≈Otherwise\add*, as soon as my master¦155955 the king¦155957 \add passes on\add* \add ≈to join his ancestors¦155960\add*, my son Shelomoh and I will be \add ≈considered to be ‘in the way’\add*.”
\p
\v 22 \add ≈Just\add* then, while she was still¦155968 talking¦155969 with the king, the prophet¦155974 Natan \add ≈appeared\add*
\v 23 and \add ≈his arrival\add* was announced to the king. He¦155981 went¦155983 \add ≈into the room and knelt in front¦155984 of the king and bowed¦155986 his face\add* to the floor.
\v 24 Then¦155993 \add *he\add* \add ≈asked\add*, “My master¦155995 the king¦155996, \add ≈did you announce that Adoniyyah will reign¦156000 after¦156001 you and sit¦156003 on your\add* throne¦156006?
\v 25 \add I ask\add* because today he sacrificed¦156012 plenty of oxen and calves and sheep¦156016. He'd \add ≈invited\add* all your sons¦156021 and army commanders¦156023, and Evyatar the priest¦156026. They're \add all\add* eating¦156028 and drinking¦156029 with him and saying, ‘\add ≈Long live¦156032\add* King Adoniyyah!’
\v 26 But¦156036 as for me, I'm \em your\em* servant, and \add ≈nor did he invite¦156049\add* Tsadok the priest¦156041 or Yehoyada's son Benayah, or Shelomoh your servant.
\v 27 Did¦156060 my master the king \add ≈organise that without telling\add* your servants¦156062 who will sit on the throne¦156068 of my master the king after¦156072 him?”

\p
\v 28 Then King David¦156077 said¦156078, “Call Batsheva \add back in\add*.” \add ≈So\add* she came¦156085 \add back\add* into the king's \add room\add* and stood¦156088 in front of \add *him\add*.
\v 29 Then¦156092 the king¦156093 \add ≈promised\add*, “As Yahweh lives \add ≈and¦156094 has rescued me from every danger\add*,
\v 30 I promise you \add in front of\add* Israel's God¦156113 Yahweh that your¦156119 son Shelomoh will reign¦156120 after¦156121 me and¦156122 will sit¦156123 on my throne¦156126 in my place¦156127. \add ≈I'll put it in action today\add*.”
\p
\v 31 Batsheva \add ≈knelt down and bowed¦156134 her face¦156138 to the floor\add* and said, “May my master¦156144, the king David¦156146 live \add ≈forever\add*.”
\p
\v 32 Then King David¦156153 \add ≈called out\add*, “\add ≈Summon\add* Tsadok the priest¦156158 for me, and Natan the prophet¦156160, and Yehoyada's son Benayah.” \add ≈So\add* they¦156165 came¦156165 \add ≈into the king's room\add*.
\v 33 “Take some of \add *my\add* servants¦156176,” the king¦156170 \add ≈instructed\add* them. “and put my son Shelomoh on my mule and lead him to the Gihon¦156193 \add Spring\add*.
\v 34 Then \add you two,\add* Tsadok and Natan, must anoint¦156195 him there¦156197 as king over Israel. Then blow the horn and \add ≈shout\add*, ‘Let King Shelomoh live!’
\v 35 Then \add ≈follow him back here where he must\add* come¦156215 and sit¦156216 on my throne¦156219. Then he'll reign¦156221 in my place¦156222 as ruler¦156226 of Israel and Yehudah.”
\p
\v 36 “\add ≈Certainly\add*,” Benayah replied. “Just as Yahweh¦156249, the God¦156248 of my master¦156249 the king has instructed.
\v 37 Just as Yahweh¦156257 has been with my master the king, so may he be with Shelomoh. And may \add ≈his rule be\add* \add even\add* greater¦156265 than \add *that\add* of my master, the king David¦156272.”
\p
\v 38 \add ≈So¦156274\add* Tsadok the priest¦156276 and Natan the prophet¦156278 and Yehoyada's son Benayah and the \add ≈kings bodyguards\add* went and put Shelomoh on the king's mule, and took him to Gihon¦156298.
\v 39 Tsadok the priest¦156302 took¦156300 the horn of oil from the sacred tent and anointed¦156310 Shelomoh \add with it\add*, and they¦156316 blew the horn and all the people¦156319 \add ≈shouted\add*, “Let King Shelomoh live¦156320!”
\v 40 Then¦156324 all the people \add ≈followed\add* him \add back\add* uphill \add to the city\add*, and the people were playing¦156330 flutes¦156330 and were \add ≈so exuberant in their¦156337 celebrations that the ground shook¦156335 with the noise¦156337\add*.
\p
\v 41 \add ≈When\add* Adoniyyah and all \add ≈his invited guests¦156343\add* had finished¦156347 eating¦156348, they heard the noise, and Yoav¦156350 heard the sound of the horn and \add ≈asked\add*, “\add ≈What's all that commotion in\add* the city¦156359?”
\v 42 He was still speaking¦156363 when Yonatan the son of Evyatar the priest¦156369 \add suddenly turned up\add*, and Adoniyyah \add ≈called\add* \add >him\add*, “Come \add over here\add* because you're a \add ≈good fellow\add* and you'll bring good news¦156379.”
\p
\v 43 “\add Actually, no,\add*” Yonatan answered¦156381. “Our master¦156386 the king David¦156389 has \add just\add* made Shelomoh \add ≈king\add*.
\v 44 The king sent¦156395 Tsadok the priest¦156402 and Natan the prophet¦156406 and Yehoyada's son Benayah and the \add ≈king's bodyguards\add*, and they placed \add @Shelomoh\add* on the king's mule.
\v 45 Then¦156419 Tsadok and Natan anointed¦156419 him as king¦156425 at Gihon¦156426. \add Now\add* they've \add ≈gone back\add* from there¦156428 \add ≈cheering\add* \add all the way\add*, and the \add whole\add* city¦156431 is \add happily\add* \add ≈celebrating\add*. That's the noise¦156433 that you're all hearing.
\v 46 \add ≈What's more\add*, Shelomoh's sitting on the royal¦156442 throne¦156441 \add right now\add*.
\v 47 \add ≈As well as that\add*, the king's servants¦156447 \add ≈went in\add* to bless our master¦156452 the king David¦156454, saying, ‘May God make Shelomoh's \add ≈reputation\add* \add even\add* better than yours, and may he make his \add ≈reign\add* \add even\add* greater¦156464 than yours.’ Then¦156444 the king in his bed, bowed¦156469 down
\v 48 and said¦156478, ‘Blessed be Israel's God¦156482 Yahweh who has \add ≈provided\add* \add a son\add* to sit on my throne¦156490 today, and \add ≈I've been able to see it\add* \add before my death\add*.’ ”
\p
\v 49 Then¦156494 all Adoniyyah's invited guests¦156498 started trembling¦156494, and they all got up and \add ≈quietly slipped back to their homes\add*.
\v 50 Adoniyyah \add himself\add* was now afraid¦156506 of what Shelomoh would do, \add ≈so\add* he went¦156510 \add to the sacred tent\add* and held on to the horns¦156512 of the altar¦156513.
\v 51 Shelomoh was told, “Listen, Adoniyyah \add ≈is afraid of the new king because\add* he's grabbed the horns¦156527 of the altar¦156528 and said, ‘Let Shelomoh the king promise me as soon as \add ≈possible\add*, that he won't \add ≈execute\add* his servant¦156541 with the sword¦156542.’ ”
\p
\v 52 “If he \add ≈shows himself as a loyal subject\add*,” Shelomoh \add ≈responded¦156544\add*, “\add ≈then he'll be able to keep his head\add*. \add ≈But¦156544\add* if \add ≈he's found¦156559 to be a traitor\add*, then he'll die¦156562.”
\v 53 \add ≈So¦156564\add* King Shelomoh sent \add for Adoniyyah\add*, and they brought¦156567 him down from beside the altar¦156569. He came and bowed down to Shelomoh the king and Shelomoh told him, “Go \add ≈home¦156579\add*.”

\p
\v 1 \add ≈When David¦156585 knew that his death was close, he instructed¦156587\add* his son Shelomoh,
\v 2 “I'll soon be \add ≈coming to my end, but\add* \add you must be\add* strong¦156600 and \add ≈sensible\add*.
\v 3 You \add ≈must maintain\add* your God¦156610 Yahweh's charge¦156607 to walk in his ways¦156612, to keep¦156604 his statutes¦156614, his commands¦156615, his judgments, and his testimonies¦156617, according to what is written¦156618 in Mosheh's¦156620 instructions, so that you'll \add ≈be wise\add* in everything you do and everywhere that you turn¦156632,

\p
\v 5 “Also you're \add ≈aware of\add* what Tseruyah's son Yoav¦156679 did to me—what he did to two¦156685 of the commanders¦156687 of Israel's armies¦156688—to Ner's son Abner and to Yeter's¦156697 son Amasa.

\v 7 \add ≈However,\add* return loyal¦156729 kindness to the sons¦156724 of Barzillai¦156725 the Gileadite¦156726, and \add ≈invite them to join you¦156727\add* at your table¦156732 because they \add ≈helped\add* me when I was fleeing from your brother¦156741 Abshalom¦156740.\x + \xo 2:7: \xt 2Sam 17:27-29.\x*
\p
\v 8 Then there's Gera's son Shimei, the Benyamite from Bahurim. He cursed¦156754 me \add ≈horribly when I was\add* going to Mahanaim. Then he went¦156758 down to meet me at the Yordan, and I promised him by Yahweh that I wouldn't \add ≈execute\add* him,\x + \xo 2:8: \xt 2Sam 16:5-13; 19:16-23.\x*

\v 25 Then Yarobam built Shekem¦164574 in the hill country¦164575 of Efraim¦164576 and he lived \add ≈there\add* \add for a while\add*. Then he \add ≈left\add* there and built Penuel.

\v 12 “\add Oh,\add* \add ≈what road did he take when he left\add*?” their¦165051 father¦165051 \add ≈asked\add*, and \add indeed\add* his sons¦165058 had \add ≈noticed which¦165062 road the man¦165064 of God¦165065 from Yehudah had taken\add*.
\v 13 \add ≈So¦165071\add* he told his sons to saddle¦165075 his donkey, and he rode \add off\add*
\v 14 after¦165087 the man of God, and found¦165090 him sitting¦165091 under¦165092 an oak tree. “Are you the man of God,” he \add ≈asked\add* him, “who came from Yehudah¦165103?”
\p “I am,” he said.
\p
\v 15 “\add ≈Come home¦165111 with me and¦165112 have something to eat¦165112\add*.” he \add ≈invited\add* him.
\p
\v 16 “\add Sorry,\add*” he \add ≈replied\add*. “I \add ≈can't go¦165120 with you or visit your home\add*, and I \add ≈can't eat¦165124 or drink¦165128\add* with you in this place¦165131,
\v 17 because Yahweh \add ≈instructed\add* me \add ≈not to eat¦165142 or drink¦165146 here, or to go¦165152 home by the same road that I came on\add*.”
\p
\v 18 Then¦165159 \add @the old prophet\add* told him¦165172, “I'm also a prophet like you, and Yahweh sent a messenger¦165169 to tell me \add ≈that I should take you home with me so you can have something to eat¦165177 and drink¦165179\add*.” (\add ≈But¦165159 that was a lie\add*.)

\v 19 \add ≈So¦165184\add* \add @the prophet\add* \add ≈accompanied him to his house¦165188 and had a meal there\add*.
\v 20 Then¦165192 while they¦165193 were \add ≈still\add* seated at the table¦165197, Yahweh spoke through the \add ≈old prophet¦165205\add*,
\v 21 and he called¦165209 out to the man¦165212 of God¦165235 who'd come¦165216 from Yehuda, “Yahweh says¦165220 this: Because you have been rebellious¦165224 against¦165224 Yahweh and \add ≈because¦165222 you didn't obey what Yahweh instructed¦165233\add* you

\p
\v 23 After \add ≈the meal was finished\add*, \add @the old prophet\add* saddled¦165269 the donkey¦165272 for the prophet that he'd brought¦165275 back,
\v 24 and he left. \add ≈But¦165277\add* on the road, a lion \add ≈came across him\add* and killed¦165281 him. His corpse \add ≈ended up\add* lying on the road with the donkey¦165286 standing beside it, and the lion also standing beside \add *it\add*.

\p
\v 26 \add ≈When\add* the prophet¦165319 who had brought¦165321 him back from the road heard he said, “\add ≈That will be\add* the man¦165326 of God¦165327 who was rebellious¦165330 against¦165330 Yahweh.
