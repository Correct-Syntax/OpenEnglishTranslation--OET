\is1 Introduction
\ip This the second letter that we have by Yohan one of the earliest followers of Yeshua. He sent this letter to a chosen woman and her children—presumably meaning ‘chosen by God’. Some think this might be referring to a group of believers (in which case, the ‘chosen sister’ of the closing sentence might also be a congregation). This short letter reminds the recipients that it's necessary to keep following the truth of Yeshua's original teaching and to love each other. It also warns about those who teach that Yeshua was not the messiah (or was not God).

\v 1 \add This letter is from Yohan\add* the elder¦155178 to the chosen¦155179 lady and her¦155184 children¦155183 who I genuinely love (as do all the other believers)
\v 2 because¦155202 of the truth¦155204 that lives in us and¦155210 will be with us forever.
\p
\v 3 \nd We¦155231\nd* will have grace¦155221, mercy¦155222, and peace¦155223 in truth¦155239 and love from \nd God¦155226\nd* the father and from his son \nd Yeshua¦155231\nd* the \nd messiah¦155232\nd*.

\p
\v 4 I was so happy that I found¦155245 some of your¦155250 children¦155249 living out the truth¦155253 as per the command¦155255 that the father¦155261 gave us.
\v 5 \x + \xo 5: \xt Jn 13:34; 15:12,17.\x*So now I'm requesting you, lady, (not making some new command¦155269, but one that we've had since the beginning¦155281) that we all need to love each other
\v 6 where the definition of love is obeying God's commands. This is the command about walking in love that you all heard¦155308 from the beginning¦155310
\v 7 because many false preachers have entered the world¦155324 who don't¦155326 believe that \nd Yeshua¦155328\nd* is the messiah who came¦155319 as a human. Any person like that is a deceiver¦155336 and¦155337 against the messiah.
\p
\v 8 So make sure that you all don't¦155344 lose what you've worked for, but rather go on to receive a full reward¦155352.
\p
\v 9 Anyone who doesn't stay with the \nd messiah's¦155370\nd* teaching or adds more to it doesn't have \nd God¦155371\nd*—it's the person who continues in the his teaching that has both the father¦155385 and the son with them.
\v 10 If anyone¦155392 comes to you¦155395 all and doesn't bring¦155402 this same message, don't accept that person into your¦155407 house¦155407, and don't tell them that it's good
\v 11 because¦155415 anyone who encourages those people is participating in the evil¦155424 that they're spreading.

\p
\v 12 I've got many things¦155425 that I wanted to write to you about, but paper¦155435 and ink¦155437 aren't working for me so I'll try to come¦155441 and then we can talk directly because I want you all to experience genuine happiness.
\p
\v 13 Your¦155467 sister's¦155466 children¦155464 (and she's also a chosen¦155469 one) send their greetings¦155461 also.
