\is1 Introduction
\ip This the second letter that we have by John one of the earliest followers of Jesus. He sent this letter to a chosen woman and her children—presumably meaning ‘chosen by God’. Some think this might be referring to a group of believers (in which case, the ‘chosen sister’ of the closing sentence might also be a congregation). This short letter reminds the recipients that it's necessary to keep following the truth of Jesus' original teaching and to love each other. It also warns about those who teach that Jesus was not the messiah (or was not God).

\v 1 \add This letter is from John\add* the elder to the chosen lady and her¦155211 children¦155210 who I genuinely love (as do all the other believers)
\v 2 because of the truth¦155231 that lives in us and¦155238 will be with us forever.
\p
\v 3 We will have grace, mercy, and peace in truth and love from God the father and from his son Jesus the messiah.
\s1 Stick to the original message
\p
\v 4 I was so happy that I found some of your children¦155277 living out the truth¦155281 as per the command that the father¦155289 gave us.
\v 5 \x + \xo 5: \xt Jn 13:34; 15:12,17.\x*So now I'm requesting you, lady, (not making some new command, but one that we've had since the beginning¦155309) that we all need to love each other
\v 6 where the definition of love is obeying God's commands. This is the command about walking in love that you all heard¦155335 from the beginning
\v 7 because many false preachers have entered the world who don't believe that Jesus is the messiah who came¦155346 as a human. Any person like that is a deceiver¦155363 and¦155364 against the messiah.
\p
\v 8 So make sure that you all don't lose what you've worked for, but rather go on to receive a full reward.
\p
\v 9 Anyone who doesn't stay with the messiah's teaching or adds more to it doesn't have God—it's the person who continues in the his teaching that has both the father¦155412 and the son with them.
\v 10 If anyone comes to you¦155422 all and doesn't bring this same message, don't accept that person into your¦155434 house¦155434, and don't tell them that it's good
\v 11 because anyone who encourages those people is participating in the evil¦155451 that they're spreading.
\s1 Closing off
\p
\v 12 I've got many things¦155452 that I wanted to write to you about, but paper and ink¦155464 aren't working for me so I'll try to come¦155468 and then we can talk directly because I want you all to experience genuine happiness.
\p
\v 13 Your sister's children¦155491 (and she's also a chosen one) send their greetings also.
