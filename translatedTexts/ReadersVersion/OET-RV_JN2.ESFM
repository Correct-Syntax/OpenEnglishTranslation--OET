\mt2 The second letter
\mt2 that we have written by
\mt1 Yohan
\is1 Introduction
\ip This the second letter that we have by Yohan one of the earliest followers of Yeshua. He sent this letter to a chosen woman and her children—presumably meaning ‘chosen by God’. Some think this might be referring to a group of believers (in which case, the ‘chosen sister’ of the closing sentence might also be a congregation). This short letter reminds the recipients that it's necessary to keep following the truth of Yeshua's original teaching and to love each other. It also warns about those who teach that Yeshua was not the messiah (or was not God).

\v 1 \add This letter is from Yohan\add* the elder¦155179 to the chosen¦155180 lady and her¦155185 children¦155184 who I genuinely love (as do all the other believers)
\v 2 because¦155203 of the truth¦155205 that lives in us and¦155211 will be with us forever.
\p
\v 3 We will have grace¦155222, mercy¦155223, and peace¦155224 in truth¦155240 and love from \nd God¦155227\nd* the father and from his son \nd Yeshua¦155232\nd* the \nd messiah¦155233\nd*.

\p
\v 4 I was so happy that I found¦155246 some of your¦155251 children¦155250 living out the truth¦155254 as per the command¦155256 that the father¦155262 gave us.
\v 5 \x + \xo 5: \xt Jn 13:34; 15:12,17.\x*So now I'm requesting you, lady, (not making some new command¦155270, but one that we've had since the beginning¦155282) that we all need to love each other
\v 6 where the definition of love is obeying God's commands. This is the command about walking in love that you all heard¦155309 from the beginning¦155311
\v 7 because many false preachers have entered the world¦155325 who don't¦155327 believe that \nd Yeshua¦155329\nd* is the messiah who came¦155320 as a human. Any person like that is a deceiver¦155337 and¦155338 against the messiah.
\p
\v 8 So make sure that you all don't¦155345 lose what you've worked for, but rather go on to receive a full reward¦155353.
\p
\v 9 Anyone who doesn't stay with the \nd messiah's¦155371\nd* teaching or adds more to it doesn't have \nd God¦155372\nd*—it's the person who continues in the his teaching that has both the father¦155386 and the son with them.
\v 10 If anyone¦155393 comes to you¦155396 all and doesn't bring¦155403 this same message, don't accept that person into your house¦155408, and don't tell them that it's good
\v 11 because anyone who encourages those people is participating in the evil¦155425 that they're spreading.

\v 12 I've got many things that I wanted to write to you about, but paper¦155436 and ink¦155438 aren't working for me so I'll try to come and then we can talk directly because I want you all to experience genuine happiness.
\p
\v 13 Your¦155468 sister's¦155467 children¦155465 (and she's also a chosen¦155470 one) send their greetings¦155462 also.
