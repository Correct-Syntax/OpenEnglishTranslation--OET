\mt2 Paul's second letter to the believers in
\mt1 Corinth
\is1 Introduction
\ip This is Paul's second letter to the believers in Corinth that we have in our Bibles, but could easily have been his third or fourth letter to them. We deduce this from his reference to other letters, e.g., see https://www.GotQuestions.org/how-many-letters-Corinthians.html, but we don't have copies of them.
\ip This letter from Paul to the believers in Corinth was written from Macedonia at a time when his relationship with the believers there wasn't very good.
\ip In first part of this document, Paul tells about his relationship with the believers there in Corinth. He explains his sadness concerning the shame of the believers and their disobedience of him. Then he tells again about his happiness that his anger faded after the believers repented of their sin and then their good relationship was restored. He urged the believers to continue to collect a gift of aid for poor believers in Yerusalem.
\ip In the final four chapters, Paul justifies his missionary status to them. (Those that accused Paul said that he's not a true ambassador of Messiah.)

\v 1 \x + \xo 1:1: \xt Acts 18:1.\x*\add This letter is from\add* Paul¦121552, a missionary of \nd Messiah¦121554 Yeshua¦121555\nd* by God's will, and¦121560 from our brother¦121563, Timothy¦121561.
\p \add It's written\add* to God's assembly¦121565 in Corinth, along with all the believers throughout \add the province of\add* Achaia.
\p
\v 2 \add May\add* \nd God¦121589\nd* our¦121591 father¦121590 and \nd master¦121593 Yeshua¦121594 Messiah¦121595\nd* give you¦121585 all grace¦121583 and peace¦121587.

\v 3 \add May\add* the God and father of our¦121603 \nd master¦121602 Yeshua¦121604 Messiah¦121605\nd* \add be\add* blessed. He is the father of compassion¦121609 and God of all comfort¦121613
\v 4 who comforts us through all our¦121621 trials so that we¦121635 can comfort others through all their trials with the \add same\add* comfort that \nd God¦121639\nd* comforts us with.
\v 5 In the same way that Messiah's many sufferings¦121644 are \add expected\add* of us, so too the Messiah's plentiful comfort¦121657 also \add reaches\add* us.
\v 6 If we're being oppressed¦121661, it's for your comfort and salvation¦121667, and if we're being comforted, it's for your comfort which enables you all to endure¦121677 the same¦121679 sufferings that we're suffering.
\v 7 We have confident¦121698 expectations for you all because¦121699 we know that you are partners¦121713 in suffering¦121716, and hence also in comfort¦121720.
\p
\v 8 \x + \xo 1:8: \xt 1Cor 15:32.\x*Brothers¦121726 and sisters, we don't¦121721 want you¦121724 to miss out on knowing¦121725 about¦121728 our difficulties in \add the province of\add* Asia \add Minor\add*. We were weighed¦121744 down with \add a situation\add* totally beyond¦121742 our power¦121743, so much so that we thought we wouldn't live through it.
\v 9 We were resigned in ourselves to the death¦121758 sentence¦121756 so that we wouldn't trust¦121762 in ourselves but in \nd God¦121769\nd* who brings the dead¦121773 back to life—
\v 10 \add the one\add* who rescued us from that death¦121779 and¦121783 will rescue us \add again\add*. He's the one we¦121789 put our hope in that he¦121793 will continue to rescue us
\v 11 as you¦121797 also cooperated¦121794 with us through¦121816 your requests \add to him\add*. Through this, many people¦121810 will give thanks¦121818 on our behalf for the gift¦121815 that was granted to us \add in answer to the prayers\add* of many.

\p
\v 12 So this is our¦121825 boast¦121824: Our¦121825 consciences¦121831 testify¦121829 that we¦121852 have conducted¦121852 \add ourselves\add* in the world (and even more so towards¦121858 all of you¦121859) with purity¦121836 and godly sincerity¦121840, not with worldly wisdom¦121846, but \add relying on\add* God's grace¦121850.
\v 13 We're not writing¦121863 other ideas to you other than what you're all reading¦121868. You're also understanding \add it\add* and I'm hoping¦121872 that you'll be able to understand it all the way through to the end¦121877
\v 14 as you \add initially\add* partially understood¦121883 us. Then on the day¦121899 when \nd Master¦121901 Yeshua¦121903\nd* \add returns\add*, you'll be able to boast¦121888 about us just as we do about all of you.
\p
\v 15 Because of my confidence¦121907 in that, I had wanted to visit you all so that you'd have a second¦121917 \add taste\add* of grace¦121919,
\v 16 \x + \xo 1:16: \xt Acts 19:1.\x*and to continue on to Macedonia¦121928 and to stay again¦121930 on the way back, and then to have you all \add help\add* send me on my way to Yudea¦121943.
\v 17 Was I just being light\add -headed\add* when I hoped for that? Or what was I thinking? Was I just thinking in worldly ways where yes, I might, and¦121967 \add at the same time\add*, no, I might not?
\v 18 But our¦121978 message¦121977 to you¦121981 all hasn't been \add both\add* ‘yes’ and¦121986 ‘no’, because \nd God¦121974\nd* is faithful¦121971.
\v 19 \x + \xo 1:19: \xt Acts 18:5.\x*His son \nd Yeshua¦121996 Messiah¦121997\nd* who I've preached about to you all, as well as \add hearing it\add* from Silas¦122007 and Timothy¦122010, didn't become ‘yes’ and ‘no’, but in him it's become ‘yes’.
\v 20 Concerning the many promises¦122024 \add made by\add* God, in \add Messiah\add* they're ‘yes’, and therefore through him the ‘Let it be so’, resulting in honour for God through us.
\v 21 It's \nd God¦122058\nd* who commissioned us and who confirms¦122047 you¦122051 and us to \nd Messiah¦122053\nd*,
\v 22 and God also \add places his\add* seal \add on\add* us and places \add his\add* \nd spirit¦122068\nd* in our¦122072 hearts¦122071.
\p
\v 23 I call on \nd God¦122077\nd* as a witness¦122075 for my soul¦122082 that it was to spare you¦122085 all that I didn't come to Corinth.
\v 24 Not that we are in any way the masters¦122092 of your faith, but rather we are fellow-workers¦122097 sharing in your happiness because¦122103 you all stand in the faith.
\c 2
\p
\v 1 So I made the decision myself¦122109 not to make a sad visit to you¦122119,
\v 2 because if I'm making you¦122126 all upset, who \add would be left to\add* cheer me up except¦122133 for the people that I would've just upset?
\v 3 So I wrote¦122140 this same¦122143 thing, so that when I came, I wouldn't get your¦122164 upsets when I should be being happy, having trusted¦122155 in you all that my happiness is in you.
\v 4 I wrote¦122173 to you much difficulty and anguish¦122171 in my heart¦122172 and through¦122175 many tears¦122177, not wanted to make you all upset, but rather so that you'd know¦122185 how much love¦122183 toward¦122189 you all is much greater than all that.
\s1 Forgiveness for the offender
\rem /s1 Forgiveness for the Sinner
\p
\v 5 If someone has caused grief, he¦122197 hasn't upset me, well not much, because I don't¦122195 want to be burdening¦122203 you¦122205 all.
\v 6 The punishment¦122210 imposed on him by most of you is appropriate,
\v 7 so now you should forgive¦122220 and comfort¦122222 him in case excess pain should drive him out.
\v 8 That's why I'm urging all of you¦122233 to \add re\add*affirm him¦122236 \add now\add* with your love¦122237.
\v 9 Another reason that I wrote¦122242 to you was to find out if you would \add stand strong\add* and be obedient¦122251 in everything.
\v 10 But \nd anyone¦122274\nd* that you forgive for anything, I also forgive, because¦122261 what I've also forgiven (if I have forgiven anything), it was for you all in the presence¦122273 of \nd Messiah¦122274\nd*
\v 11 so that we can't be exploited¦122277 by Satan¦122280 (because¦122282 we're not ignorant about his¦122283 intentions).

\p
\v 12 When I went to Troas\x + \xo 2:12-13: \xt Acts 20:1.\x* \add to preach\add* the good¦122294 message¦122294 of the messiah and¦122297 an opportunity presented itself to me in the messiah,
\v 13 my spirit¦122307 couldn't relax¦122305 because I found out that my brother¦122316 Titos¦122314 wasn't there, so I said my goodbyes¦122319 to them and continued on to Macedonia¦122323.

\rem /s1 Victory through Christ
\p
\v 14 But \add we're\add* thankful¦122327 to \nd God¦122326\nd* who displays us as victors in the messiah, and¦122336 reveals¦122343 the aroma¦122338 of the knowledge¦122341 of the messiah, through¦122344 us in every¦122347 place¦122348.
\v 15 Because¦122349 of \nd Messiah¦122350\nd*, we¦122352 who are being¦122357 saved¦122357 are a sweet¦122351 fragrance¦122351 to \nd God¦122354\nd*, and¦122358 also the ones perishing¦122361.
\v 16 On one hand \add we're\add* an aroma of death to \add those choosing\add* death, and on the other¦122370 hand, an aroma of life to \add those choosing\add* life. \add Wow,\add* who's worthy¦122382 \add enough\add* for that?
\v 17 We're not like the many \add others\add* who're peddling¦122390 God's message¦122392 \add to make a profit\add*, but we speak in front¦122403 of God in sincerity¦122398. As \add followers\add* of God, we speak about \nd Messiah¦122408\nd*.

\s1 Following the new agreement by the spirit
\rem /s1 Servants of the New Covenant; Ministers of the New Covenant; Paul's commission as an apostle
\p
\v 1 \add Oh,\add* are we beginning¦122410 to pat ourselves¦122413 on the back again¦122411? Don't we need written references for you all, or from you all, like some others \add do\add*?
\v 2 It's all of you¦122434 who're our references, and having¦122436 been written in our hearts¦122439, it's known¦122442 about and being read by all people¦122447.
\v 3 \x + \xo 3:3: a \xt Exo 24:12; \xo b \xt Jer 31:33; Eze 11:19; 36:26.\x*It shows that you¦122450 who were served¦122453 by us, are \add now\add* Messiah's letter¦122451 that wasn't written with ink¦122459 but with God's living¦122463 \nd spirit¦122461\nd*—not written on stone¦122467 tablets but on people's hearts¦122471.
\p
\v 4 We have such confidence¦122474 towards¦122482 \nd God¦122484\nd* through¦122479 the \nd messiah¦122481\nd*,
\v 5 not that we¦122490 ourselves are worthy¦122489 to consider ourselves anything¦122495 \add special\add*, but our¦122505 qualifications¦122504 come from \nd God¦122508\nd*.
\v 6 \x + \xo 3:6: \xt Jer 31:31.\x*He qualified¦122512 us as servants¦122514 of a new agreement—not \add following it\add* by the letter, but by the spirit, because¦122522 \add following by\add* the letter leads to death whereas \add following by\add* the spirit gives life.
\rem /s1 The Glory of the New Covenant
\p
\v 7 \x + \xo 3:7: \xt Exo 34:29.\x*The system which was inscribed on stone¦122543 \add tablets\add* and which results in death¦122537 was so incredible \add when it was given\add* that the Israeli's couldn't even \add bring themselves\add* to look at Moses' face because¦122558 it shone so brightly. But if that system is being¦122566 nullified¦122566,
\v 8 won't this system via the \nd spirit¦122573\nd* be even greater?
\v 9 If the system that brought condemnation¦122584 was incredible, how much greater is the system that leads to righteousness¦122592,
\v 10 because that \add earlier system\add* seems ordinary now when compared with the more incredible greatness of the new system,
\v 11 and if what ended up being¦122615 replaced was incredible, how much more incredible is the system that lasts.
\p
\v 12 So¦122625 then, since that's our expectation, we¦122630 can be very bold,
\v 13 \x + \xo 3:13: \xt Exo 34:33.\x*not just like Moses putting¦122635 a veil over his¦122640 face¦122639 because¦122642 the Israeli's couldn't even look¦122645 at him¦122640 \add when introducing\add* a system that would be replaced.
\v 14 But their¦122659 thinking¦122658 was inflexible because \add even\add* until¦122660 this very day, the same veil remains¦122674 during the public¦122670 reading¦122670 of the Hebrew scriptures—it's not opened up \add because it's only\add* \nd Messiah¦122679\nd* that nullifies¦122680 it.
\v 15 So these days whenever¦122684 Moses' writings are being¦122687 read, a veil lies across their¦122694 hearts¦122693,
\v 16 \x + \xo 3:16: \xt Exo 34:34.\x*but whenever¦122710 \add that heart\add* might turn¦122714 towards the \nd master¦122716\nd*, the veil will be removed.
\v 17 Now the master is the spirit, and there's freedom¦122732 wherever¦122726 the master's spirit is.
\v 18 All of us who've had our faces unveiled¦122736 are reflecting¦122742 the master's greatness, and that same image¦122747 transforms¦122748 us from greatness to greatness. This comes from the master who is the \nd spirit¦122758\nd*.

\s1 The treasure placed in human containers
\rem /s1 Treasure in Clay Jars; Treasures in Jars of Clay; Spiritual Treasure in Clay Pots; Treasure in Perishable Containers
\p
\v 1 So because we have this ministry as a result of God's mercy¦122766, we're not discouraged
\v 2 but rather, we have renounced¦122771 any shameful¦122775 things that were hidden¦122773 and continue our \add spiritual\add* journey. Avoiding deception and \add taking care\add* not to distort God's message¦122783, we present the truth¦122790 \add clearly\add* even as we commend¦122791 ourselves¦122794 to everyone's¦122796 conscience¦122797 before¦122799 God.
\v 3 But even if our¦122809 good¦122808 message¦122808 is concealed, it's concealed from those who are perishing¦122812.
\v 4 The god of this age has blinded¦122822 the thinking¦122824 of the unbelievers¦122826 so that the light of the good message¦122837 about the greatness of the \nd messiah¦122842\nd* who's God's image¦122845, doesn't radiate¦122832 out to them,
\v 5 because it's not us ourselves that we're proclaiming¦122851, but the \nd master¦122856 Yeshua¦122865 Messiah¦122855\nd*. \nd We¦122854\nd* \add serve\add* as your¦122861 slaves¦122859 because of him,
\v 6 \x + \xo 4:6: \xt Gen 1:3.\x*because¦122885 the God who said¦122871, ‘Light will be shining¦122876 out of the darkness¦122874’, shined¦122879 in our¦122883 hearts¦122882 so that we could experience God's greatness in the face¦122895 of \nd Yeshua¦122896 Messiah¦122897\nd*.
\p
\v 7 So we¦122898 have this treasure¦122901 stored in containers made from the dirt, so that the excellence¦122908 of the power¦122910 will be from \nd God¦122913\nd* and¦122914 not from us \add ourselves\add*.
\v 8 We might be oppressed¦122920 but we won't be crushed¦122925, perplexed¦122926 but we won't despair¦122929,
\v 9 persecuted¦122930 but we won't be abandoned¦122933, and struck¦122934 down but we won't perish¦122937.
\v 10 We always¦122938 carry¦122947 around in our bodies the death¦122940 of Yeshua, so that the life¦122951 of Yeshua may also be revealed¦122962 in our bodies,
\v 11 because¦122972 we¦122966 who are alive are always¦122964 being¦122971 given¦122971 over to death¦122970 for \nd Yeshua's¦122973\nd* sake, so that his life¦122977 may also be revealed¦122982 in our¦122988 mortal¦122986 bodies.
\v 12 So then, death¦122992 is working in us, but¦122997 life¦122998 \add is working\add* in all of you¦123000.
\p
\v 13 \x + \xo 4:13: \xt Psa 116:10 (LXX).\x*We have the same¦123004 spirit¦123005 of faith¦123007 as what's written¦123010: ‘I believed¦123011, therefore I talked about it.’ We also believe so we also talk about it,
\v 14 knowing¦123021 that the one who brought Yeshua back to life, will also bring us back to life along with Yeshua, and¦123035 will be presenting¦123036 us along with all of you¦123038.
\v 15 All of this is for you, so that after \add experiencing\add* much grace¦123046, you all will be even more thankful¦123052 and thus honour \nd God¦123058\nd*.

\rem /s1 Living by Faith
\p
\v 16 Because of that we're not discouraged because even if our outer person is being ruined¦123071, our inner person is being renewed¦123077 day by day
\v 17 because¦123096 our small, temporary troubles will produce¦123095 an excess of great honour for us.
\v 18 We don't¦123097 just look at what we can see, but include the things that can't be seen, because¦123107 visible things are temporary¦123109, but the things that last forever are invisible \add to our¦123099 eyes\add*.

\s1 Our future bodies
\rem /s1 Our Heavenly Dwelling; New Bodies
\p
\v 1 We know that when the temporary, earthly¦123120 home \add (our¦123121 body)\add* that we live in is demolished, we will have a building¦123127 from \nd God¦123129\nd* that's not built by human hands—an eternal¦123134 house in the heavens¦123137.
\v 2 Actually, that's also why we¦123142 groan¦123142—wanting to be clothed¦123149 in our¦123145 heavenly¦123148 \add bodies\add*.
\v 3 Yes, once we're properly dressed¦123156 we won't feel naked¦123158
\v 4 because while we live in these temporary homes we are groaning¦123167. It's not that we want to dispose of these temporary homes, but we want to be \add permanently\add* clothed¦123176 so that our mortal¦123180 \add parts\add* might be enveloped by life¦123183.
\v 5 It's \nd God¦123192\nd* who prepared¦123186 us for this reason—yes, the one who deposited¦123198 the \nd spirit¦123200\nd* into us.
\p
\v 6 Because of that, we're always¦123203 confident¦123201 and¦123204 known¦123205 that while we're at home¦123207 in our bodies, we are distanced from the \nd master¦123215\nd*,
\v 7 but we¦123219 walk¦123219 by faith¦123217 and not by how things look.
\v 8 And we do have confidence¦123223 and look forward to being absent¦123231 out of these bodies and being at home¦123236 with the \nd master¦123239\nd*,
\v 9 so that's why we're ambitious¦123242 to please¦123248 the master, whether¦123244 we're \add still\add* in these bodily homes or absent¦123247 from them.
\v 10 \x + \xo 5:10: \xt Rom 14:10.\x*Yes, we must all stand at our court hearing in front of the \nd messiah¦123261\nd*, so that each of us may receive¦123263 \add justice\add* for what we did while in these bodies, whether¦123273 it¦123256 was good¦123274 or evil¦123277.

\v 12 Again, we're not trying to promote ourselves¦123301 to you, but we're giving¦123306 you all an opportunity¦123305 to take pride in us, so that you can \add respond to\add* those who take pride in \add outside\add* appearances¦123318 rather than in what is in the heart¦123324.

\p
\v 20 Because of that, we are ambassadors¦123454 for Messiah, as though¦123455 God is encouraging \add others\add* through¦123459 us, so we implore you for Messiah: Make your peace with God.
\v 21 God took the one who hadn't experienced sin and made him into sin for us so that in him, we could become¦123478 not guilty in God's sight.

\v 3 I'm not pronouncing condemnation¦123803 because¦123807 I've said¦123806 previously¦123806 that you¦123815 all are in our¦123814 hearts¦123812 so together we'll die¦123818 and¦123819 together we'll live \add again\add*.

\v 7 It wasn't just his¦123888 coming¦123887, but also because¦123910 he'd been comforted¦123893 by all of you. He told us about your longing¦123903 for me, and your mourning¦123906 \add for my troubles\add* and your zeal for me, and it really cheered me up.

\v 8 Yes, because¦123940 even if I made you sad with my letter, I don't¦123925 regret \add sending\add* it. (\add Well,\add* for a while I was sad for you that I had sent the letter.)
\v 9 \add Anyway,\add* now I'm happy, not that it made you sad, but because that sadness led to turning away from your sin because \add that\add* sorrow was according¦123957 to God's \add values\add* so you didn't lose anything because of us.
\v 10 Because sorrow according¦123967 to God's \add values\add* brings repentance¦123970 that leads to salvation¦123972 without regrets, but the world's¦123979 sorrow leads to death¦123981.
\v 11 See how this sorrow¦123990 according¦123988 to God's \add values\add* has produced¦123993 earnestness¦123997 in you all, but also eagerness to clear yourselves, resentment¦124002, fear¦124004, longing¦124007, zeal, and vengeance¦124012.

\p
\v 12 So if I also wrote¦124025 to you all, not on account of the one having done wrong, nor on account of the one having been wronged, but on account of your¦124045 earnestness¦124044 that would be revealed¦124042 to us all before¦124053 \nd God¦124055\nd*,

\v 14 Yes, if I've boasted anything¦124084 about you all to him, I wasn't disgraced¦124091, but as we spoke¦124099 the truth to you all about everything, so also did our¦124106 boasting to Titos¦124109 become¦124111 true

\v 1 \x + \xo 8:1-4: \xt Rom 15:26.\x*And then, brothers¦124145 and¦124145 sisters¦124145, we¦124142 want you¦124144 to know about how \nd God¦124149\nd* showed kindness to the assemblies¦124154 in Macedonia¦124157
\v 2 in that as they proved¦124161 themselves in \add a time of\add* persecution, they continued to show great positivity and¦124168 from the depth¦124171 of their poverty¦124173, their generosity¦124182 \add resulted in\add* plentiful¦124175 riches¦124180.
\v 3 So I'm testifying¦124187 about their ability, and besides¦124189 that, they voluntarily¦124192
\v 4 and enthusiastically begged us to allow them the grace¦124200 and fellowship¦124203 that would come from their service¦124205 to other believers.
\v 5 It wasn't something that we¦124215 expected of them, but¦124217 they¦124219 gave¦124219 themselves¦124218—firstly¦124221 to the \nd master¦124224\nd*, and¦124225 also to us by God's will.
\v 6 So we encouraged Titos¦124234 that just as he began¦124238 to do previously¦124238, that he would go on to cultivate this \add generosity\add* in you.
\v 7 But since you're all prolific in everything¦124252—in faith¦124256 and speech¦124258 and knowledge¦124260 and all earnestness¦124263 and in the love¦124272 from us to you all—make sure that you're all prolific in this grace¦124278 \add of giving\add*.
\p
\v 8 I'm not saying this as a command¦124282, but¦124284 approving¦124296 the genuineness¦124295 of your¦124293 love¦124294 through¦124285 the earnestness¦124288 of others¦124287.
\v 9 because¦124307 you all have experienced the grace¦124300 of our¦124303 \nd master¦124302 Yeshua¦124304 Messiah¦124305\nd*: that although he was rich, he became¦124310 poor so that all of you in your¦124307 poverty¦124317 might become rich.
\p
\v 10 And I'm giving¦124323 my opinion¦124320 on this because¦124325 it's beneficial¦124327 for you¦124326 all not only to do what began¦124337 last year¦124339, but¦124333 to do it willingly¦124336.
\v 11 Now you should see this through so that you're all not just ready to be willing¦124351, but also to actually accomplish that from what you have,
\v 12 because if the readiness¦124362 is there, it¦124369 is acceptable¦124369 according to what a person has, not according to what they do not have.
\p
\v 13 \add Of course,\add* it's not that others¦124377 should be relaxing¦124378 while you¦124379 all endure difficulty, but¦124382 with an aim of equality¦124384.

\v 3 \x + \xo 11:3: \xt Gen 3:1-5,13.\x*But I'm afraid that just as the crafty¦125295 serpent¦125288 somehow¦125285 deceived¦125290 Heva (Eve), your¦125301 thinking¦125300 might get corrupted¦125298 from its sincerity¦125304 and¦125305 purity¦125307 in the \nd messiah¦125311\nd*.
\v 4 Indeed even if another \nd Yeshua¦125318\nd* came and proclaimed something different from what we proclaimed, or if you receive another spirit¦125324 that you hadn't received already, or a good message¦125331 \add different\add* from what you've already heard, you might tolerate¦125337 it.
\p
\v 5 I reckon that I wasn't deficient¦125344 compared to the ‘super¦125346 missionaries’,
\v 6 but even if my speaking is just ordinary¦125351, \add my\add* my knowledge¦125357 isn't and I've made everything clear to you¦125366 all in every way.
\p
\v 7 Or did I disobey \nd God¦125379\nd* when I humbled¦125371 myself¦125370 so that all of you might be elevated, because¦125375 I shared the good message with you all without any personal gain?
\v 8 I've ‘robbed¦125385’ other assemblies¦125384 in order to support¦125387 my ministry to all of you¦125390,
\v 9 \x + \xo 11:9: \xt Php 4:15-18.\x*and when I was with you and needed \add something\add*, I wasn't a burden to anyone¦125400, because¦125402 the believers¦125407 who came from Macedonia¦125410 supplied what I needed. Thus I have kept¦125418 myself¦125416 from being¦125393 a burden to you in any way, and will keep doing so.
\v 10 The \nd messiah's¦125423\nd* truth¦125422 is in me such that my boasting¦125428 in the regions¦125437 of Achaia won't be stopped¦125432.
\v 11 Why's that? Because¦125442 I don't¦125443 love you¦125445 all? \nd God¦125447\nd* knows that I do.
\p
\v 12 But what I'm doing, I'll keep on doing, so that I can deny the opportunity to those \add people\add* who're looking for an opportunity so that what they boast¦125464 about, we'll already be doing,
\v 13 because¦125476 they are false¦125472 ambassadors¦125477 \add and deceitful¦125474 workers¦125473\add*—masquerading¦125475 themselves¦125475 as Messiah's missionaries,
\v 14 and that's no surprise because¦125484 Satan¦125486 himself¦125483 masquerades¦125487 as \add a\add* messenger¦125489 of light¦125490.
\v 15 So then it's no great¦125492 \add surprise\add* if his¦125498 servants are masquerading¦125499 as God's servants, \add but\add* their end will be the consequence of their actions.

\p
\v 16 I'll say it again: no one should suppose¦125516 that I'm foolish, but if they do, at least accept me as foolish so that I can also boast¦125534 a little¦125531.
\v 17 When I say that, I'm not talking¦125536 \add words from\add* the \nd master¦125540\nd*, but¦125542 like a fool confidently¦125549 boasting¦125551.
\v 18 Many boast like worldly \add people\add*, so I'll boast as well,
\v 19 because you¦125562 prudent¦125565 \add ones\add* happily tolerate¦125562 foolish¦125564 people.
\v 20 Yes, you tolerate¦125567 those who'll enslave¦125572 you all, those who'll exploit you, those who'll take \add advantage of\add* you all, those who promote themselves, and anyone whacks you in the face¦125586.
\v 21 I'm talking¦125605 about dishonour¦125590 as if we¦125594 were weak, but¦125599 (speaking¦125605 foolishly¦125604 again), anything that anyone¦125601 else is brave enough to do, then I will also be brave enough \add to match\add*.
\v 22 Are they Hebrews? I am too. Are they Israelis? So am I. Are they descendants of Abraham¦125616? Me also.
\v 23 \x + \xo 11:23: \xt Acts 16:23.\x*Are they¦125621 Messiah's servants? \add Well,\add* I'm above¦125624 them (speaking¦125623 insanely¦125622 now): I've worked harder, been in prison¦125633 more often, \add endured\add* uncountable beatings¦125637, and been close to death¦125641 more often.
\v 24 \x + \xo 11:24: \xt Deu 25:3.\x*I've received¦125649 the thirty-nine lashes from the Jewish \add leadership\add* five¦125645 times¦125645,
\v 25 \x + \xo 11:25: a \xt Acts 16:22; \xo b \xt Acts 14:19.\x*was beaten three times with rods, was stoned¦125653 once, shipwrecked¦125655 three times, and I was in the ocean for a day¦125656 and a night¦125656.
\v 26 \x + \xo 11:26: a \xt Acts 9:23; \xo b \xt Acts 14:5.\x*I've done \add many long\add* trips, crossed dangerous rivers¦125664, risked being robbed¦125666, \add was persecuted\add* by my own people as well as by non-Jews¦125672, have been in danger in the city¦125675, in the wilderness¦125678 and on the ocean, \add as well as being attacked\add* by false¦125684 \add teachers\add*.
\v 27 I've worked often and worked hard, often needing to keep guard, \add suffered\add* famine¦125693 and thirst¦125695, fasted often, and been cold¦125700 and lacking clothing.
\v 28 \add Then\add* apart from all those external¦125705 things, I've been opposed¦125707 every day¦125713—\add not to mention\add* my concern for all the assemblies¦125718.
\v 29 What person falters and I don't falter with them? Who stumbles¦125725 \add in their walk with God\add* and I don't suffer with them?
\p
\v 30 If it's appropriate¦125732 to be boasting, what I'd boast about would be my¦125736 weaknesses¦125735.
\v 31 The \nd god¦125739\nd* and¦125740 father¦125741 of the \nd master¦125743 Yeshua¦125745\nd*—the one who should be praised for all the ages—knows that I'm not lying¦125756.

\s1 What God showed Paul
\rem /s1 Paul's Visions and Revelations; Paul's Vision and His Thorn in the Flesh
\p
\v 1 It's not appropriate¦125788 or beneficial¦125792 to be boasting¦125786, so I'll come to \add the\add* visions¦125800 and revelations¦125802 from the \nd master¦125803\nd*.\f + \fr 12:1 \ft See http://bibledifferences.net/2019/04/24/156-boast.\f*
\v 2 Fourteen years¦125809 ago I observed a man¦125805 who was a believer in \nd Messiah¦125807\nd* who was pulled \add up\add* to the third¦125830 heaven¦125831. (I didn't know whether¦125811 this physically happened or just in the spiritual \add realm\add*.)
\v 3 And I know that man¦125836 (\nd God¦125848\nd* only knows if it was in the physical or \add just\add* the spiritual \add realm\add*)
\v 4 was pulled \add up\add* into paradise¦125854 and¦125855 heard¦125856 messages¦125858 which¦125859 can't be put into words (because \add living\add* people aren't allow to speak¦125863 them).
\v 5 I'm \add prepared\add* to boast about that man¦125866, but¦125869 I won't boast about myself¦125870 because I won't boast \add at all\add* except¦125874 \add about\add* my weaknesses¦125878,
\v 6 because even if I did want¦125882 to boast¦125884, I wouldn't be being foolish¦125888, because I would be speaking¦125891 the truth¦125889. But I'll refrain¦125892 in case anyone¦125895 reckons that I'm more than what they can see or hear¦125904 about me.
\p
\v 7 So to keep my head from getting too big because of those incredible revelations¦125912, I was given¦125917 a ‘thorn¦125919’ in my body—Satan's¦125924 messenger¦125922 to harass me and keep me from becoming conceited.
\v 8 Three times I begged the \nd master¦125936\nd* that it might leave me
\v 9 and he told me, “Is my grace¦125948 good enough for you? \add My¦125949\add* power reaches its conclusion through weakness.” Therefore¦125959 I'll quite gladly¦125958 boast¦125961 about my weaknesses so that the \nd messiah's¦125973\nd* power can take residence¦125967 in me.
\v 10 So¦125974 then I take pleasure¦125975 in weaknesses¦125977, in insults¦125979 and hardships¦125982, in persecutions¦125984 and distresses¦125987 for \nd Messiah¦125989\nd* because¦125991 whenever¦125990 I might be faltering¦125992, that's when I'm powerful¦125994.
\s1 Paul's concerns about the believers there
\rem /s1 Paul's final appeal; Paul's Concern for the Corinthian Church; Paul's Concern for the Corinthians
\p
\v 11 You have forced me to become¦125996 foolish¦125997, because I should have been commended¦126009 by you all because I'm no less than those ‘super¦126016 missionaries’ even if I am \add just\add* ‘nothing’.
\v 12 Indeed, I persevered to deliver missionary results among¦126028 you all, as well as signs, wonders¦126037, and miracles¦126039.
\v 13 In what way were you all treated less than the rest of the assemblies¦126049, except¦126050 that I didn't load you with any burdens¦126056? Forgive¦126058 me for this mistake.
\p
\v 14 Now listen, I'm ready¦126066 to visit you all for the third¦126064 time and I won't be aiming to burden¦126073 you down because¦126088 I'm not after what you have, but rather \add my interest is in\add* you yourselves. The children shouldn't be saving \add to support\add* the parents, but the parents \add should support\add* the children.
\v 15 I'm happy to invest everything I have, including all of myself, for the sake of your¦126105 souls¦126104. Am I being loved¦126114 less the more that I love you all?
\p
\v 16 So that's that. I'm didn't burden¦126121 you all, but being¦126125 crafty¦126126 \add by nature\add*, I took¦126129 you all by trickery.
\v 17 Did any of those that I sent¦126133 to you exploit¦126138 you all?
\v 18 I urged¦126140 Titos \add to go there\add* along with another believer. Surely¦126146 Titos must have exploited¦126147 you all? \add No,\add* didn't we all do the same things as \add guided by\add* the same spirit¦126153.
\p
\v 19 \add Now\add* you're already supposing¦126162 that we're defending¦126165 \add ourselves\add*? \add Actually,\add* we're speaking¦126172 \add as followers of\add* \nd Messiah¦126171\nd* knowing that \nd God¦126169\nd* is watching, and dear friends, everything has been \add with the aim of\add* building¦126180 you up.
\v 20 You see, I'm worried that when I come¦126185, I might not find you \add living\add* how I'd want, and you all might not find me how you'd want. \add I'm worried that I might find\add* strife¦126199 and jealousy¦126200, anger and selfish¦126203 ambition¦126203, slander¦126204 and gossip¦126205, and conceit¦126206 and disturbances¦126207.
\v 21 \add I'm worried that\add* when I come¦126211, \nd God¦126218\nd* will humble¦126215 me there with you¦126221 all, and I might be upset about many who've sinned¦126226 in the past and haven't repented¦126229 from the impurity¦126232 and sexual¦126234 immorality¦126234 and self-centred living that they¦126238 practiced¦126238.

\s1 Testing yourselves
\rem /s1 Paul's Final Advice; Final Warnings and Greetings; Further Warning
\p
\v 1 This is the third time¦126240 that I'll be coming¦126244 there to you¦126247 all. ‘Every account must be confirmed by at least two¦126251, \add preferably\add* three¦126255, witnesses¦126252.’\x + \xo 13:1: \xt Deu 17:6; 19:15.\x*
\v 2 I said¦126259 previously on my second¦126265 visit and while I'm absent¦126267 I'll say it again to those who sinned¦126271 previously and to all the rest \add as well\add*: if I come¦126278 back \add to find\add* the same¦126280 again, I won't be sparing¦126283 anyone¦126283,
\v 3 because you're all wanting proof¦126286 that I speak¦126291 from \nd Messiah¦126292\nd* who isn't incapable of \add handling\add* you all but is quite able \add to do what he wants\add*.
\v 4 Although he was executed¦126306 in weakness¦126308, \add now\add* he's living by God's power. We also falter¦126317 in him, but will be living with him by God's power towards¦126331 you all.
\p
\v 5 Test yourselves to check if you're \add living\add* in the faith¦126339—you yourselves can decide that. Or can't you all recognise¦126344 whether¦126335 or not \nd Messiah¦126347 Yeshua¦126348\nd* is living in you? Surely you're not that unqualified¦126355?
\v 6 But I'm hoping¦126357 that you¦126360 all will know that we're not unqualified¦126365.
\v 7 And we're asking \nd God¦126371\nd* that you won't do evil¦126375—not so that we'll be seen¦126381 to be approved¦126380, but so that you all will be doing¦126388 good¦126387, \add even if\add* we may seem unqualified¦126392,
\v 8 because¦126402 we're not able \add to do\add* anything¦126397 against¦126398 the truth—only \em for\em* the truth.
\v 9 So we're glad whenever¦126407 we falter¦126409, but you all might be quite capable as we also desire that you all \add grow to\add* perfection.
\v 10 I'm writing¦126426 these¦126423 things while I'm absent¦126424, so that when I'm present¦126428 I won't have to treat¦126431 \add you all\add* severely¦126430 according¦126432 to the authority¦126434 that the \nd master¦126439\nd* gave¦126440 me for building¦126443 and¦126444 not for tearing¦126447 down.
