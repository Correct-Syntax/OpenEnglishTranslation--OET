\v 1 The account by Hakalyah's son Nehemyah¦221830 \add (Nehemiah¦221830)\add*.
\s1 Nehemyah's prayer for Yerushalem
\rem /s1 Nehemiah's Concern for Jerusalem
\p In the month¦221835 of Kislev¦221837 during the twentieth¦221840 year¦221839 \add of the reign of King Artahshashta (Artaxerxes) over the Persian Empire\add*, I was in the capital city of Shushan¦221843 \add (Susa¦221843)\add*.
\v 2 Hanani¦221847, one of my brothers¦221849, came¦221846 \add ≈with some other\add* men¦221851 from Yehudah¦221852, and I asked¦221853 them about the Jews who'd escaped¦221857 \add ≈and managed to avoid being exiled\add*, and about Yerushalem¦221866,
\v 3 and he told me, “The ones left behind in the provinces¦221878 and who \add ≈avoided\add* the captivity¦221876, are in \add ≈a bad way and feeling depressed\add*. The wall around Yerushalem¦221883 was torn down, and its gates¦221885 were burnt.”
\p
\v 4 When I heard¦221890 \add ≈all that\add*, I sat¦221896 down and I \add ≈was upset for days¦221899\add*. I fasted and cried and prayed¦221902 to the God¦221904 of the heavens¦221905,
\v 5 and I said, “Oh Yahweh¦221909, God of the heavens¦221911, the great¦221913 and awesome¦221914 God, who keeps¦221915 \add &his\add* agreement and \add ≈is determinedly loyal\add* to those who love him and \add ≈obey his instructions\add*:
\v 6 Please listen¦221930 \add ≈carefully\add* to your servant's prayer¦221933 that I'm \add ≈presenting to you\add* today, day and night¦221941, on account of your servants the \add ≈Israelis\add*. \add ≈On behalf of all Israelis\add*, I'm confessing¦221947 that we've sinned against you—\add ≈both my generation and previous generations\add*.
\v 7 We've acted¦221964 extremely corruptly—\add ≈disobeying\add* you by not \add ≈obeying your\add* commands¦221971, statutes¦221974, and judgments that you \add ≈instructed¦221979 through\add* your servant¦221983 Mosheh¦221982.
\v 8 Please remember \add ≈that you told\add* your servant¦221996 Mosheh¦221995 \add ≈that if we act unfaithfully¦221999, you yourself would scatter¦222001 us\add* among the nations,\x + \xo 1:8: \xt Lev 26:33.\x*
\v 9 \add ≈but if we'd return¦222005 to you and obey your instructions, then even if we had been banished to the ends of the earth, you'd gather¦222018 us back up and bring¦222019 us back to the place¦222023 where¦222024 you've established your name¦222029 and reputation\add*.\x + \xo 1:9: \xt Deu 30:1-5.\x*
\p
\v 10 “\add ≈We're your\add* servants¦222033 and your people¦222034 that you¦222036 \add ≈rescued from slavery\add* with your \add ≈incredible power¦222037\add*.
\v 11 Oh, my master¦222043, please \add ≈listen carefully\add* to your servant's prayer, and to the prayer of your \add other\add* servants who delight¦222057 to \add ≈honour\add* your name¦222061. Please¦222042 cause your servant to succeed¦222062 today, and give \add ≈me favour in the king's eyes\add*.”
\p Now as for me, I was the king's cupbearer.

\p
\v 1 In the \add ≈spring\add* of the twentieth¦222083 year of King Artahshashta's reign, I \add ≈was serving\add* wine to the king. \add ≈I'd never looked sad before¦222087 in his presence¦222098\add*,
\v 2 and the king¦222102 \add ≈asked\add* me, “Why \add ≈do you look unhappy\add*? \add ≈I know that\add* you're not sick¦222109 \add ≈so something must be upsetting you\add*.”
\p I was very scared
\v 3 and I \add ≈answered\add* the king, “May the king live forever¦222124. \add ≈I can't help but look unhappy when the city¦222132 containing my ancestors' graves has had its gates¦222138 burnt down and it's now abandoned\add*.”\x + \xo 2:3: \xt 2Ki 25:8-10; 2Ch 36:19; Jer 52:12-14.\x*
\v 4 “\add ≈So what would you¦222151 like to happen\add*?” the king¦222145 \add ≈asked\add*.
\p Then I prayed¦222153 to the God¦222156 of heaven¦222157
\v 5 and \add ≈answered\add* the king, “If \add ≈I have your favour, and if it seems\add* good to the king, \add maybe\add* you'd send me to Yehudah¦222176—to the city¦222179 of my ancestors' graves \add ≈so I could\add* rebuild¦222182 it.”
\p
\v 6 Then¦222184 the king said to me, with the queen¦222187 sitting¦222189 beside¦222190 him, “\add ≈How long would\add* your journey¦222195 be? And when would you return¦222197?” \add ≈So¦222184 I gave him a date and he seemed happy with it, because he released me to go\add*.
\p
\v 7 \add ≈Then¦222207 I made another request\add*, “If it \add ≈pleases\add* the king, let letters¦222215 be given to me for the governors¦222221 of \add ≈the provinces across the Euphrates river¦222223 to ask them to help me in my travel towards\add* Yehudah¦222232.
\v 8 \add Also\add* a letter¦222234 to Asaf¦222237, the keeper of the king's forest¦222239, so he'll give me timber for the beams¦222247 of the gates¦222250 of the fortress¦222251 \add ≈near the temple\add*, and for the city¦222256 wall, and for the house \add ≈that I'll live in\add*.” Then¦222234 the king \add ≈granted¦222262 those requests, thanks to God's help on what I was doing\add*.

\p
\v 9 Then¦222272 I went¦222272 to the governors¦222275 of \add ≈the provinces across the Euphrates\add*, and I gave them the king's letters¦222282. The king had sent army officers and horsemen with me.
\v 10 When Sanvallat¦222293 the Horonite and the servant Toviyyah¦222295 the Ammonite¦222297 heard \add >my plans\add*, \add ≈they were very angry that someone¦222305 would come¦222304 to help the Israelis¦222309\add*.
\rem /s1 Nehemiah Inspects Jerusalem's Wall; Nehemiah Inspects Jerusalem's Walls; Nehemiah's Inspection of the Walls
\p
\v 11 \add ≈So¦222311\add* I \add ≈got\add* to Yerushalem¦222314 and¦222315 was there¦222317 for three¦222319 days¦222318,
\v 12 \add ≈One night¦222323, I got up and took a few men¦222325 with me, without having told anyone what I felt that my God¦222334 had been telling me\add* to do for Yerushalem¦222340. \add ≈We only had the one horse\add* that I was riding¦222350,
\v 13 and we went¦222353 out \add ≈in the dark\add* through the Valley Gate and past the Dragon Well to the Dung Gate. I was \add ≈carefully inspecting\add* the \add *city\add* walls¦222369—\add ≈noting\add* where they¦222376 were broken down and which¦222371 gates¦222375 had been burnt out.
\v 14 Then¦222379 I crossed to the Fountain Gate and the Royal Pool, but there¦222388 was nowhere that we could get my mount¦222391 through \add the rubble\add*.
\v 15 \add ≈So¦222395\add* I went up the creek bed \add ≈in the dark, carefully inspecting\add* the wall, before turning back and returning¦222406 \add quietly\add* through the Valley Gate.
\p
\v 16 \add ≈None of the city officials\add* knew where¦222411 I'd gone or what I was doing¦222415, and \add up until¦222423 this point\add* I hadn't yet told \add >my plans\add* to the Jewish \add leaders\add* or the priests¦222417 or nobles¦222418 or city officials, or \add ≈hired any workers\add*.
\rem /s1 Decision to Restore the Walls
\v 17 \add ≈So now\add* I told them, “You call all see the \add ≈desparate situation\add* that we're in: Yerushalem¦222438 is \add ≈in ruins\add* and its¦222440 gates¦222440 have been burned¦222441 out. \add ≈So now,\add* let's rebuild¦222444 the \add *city\add* wall and then we'll no longer be \add ≈mocked by others\add*.”
\v 18 I told them how God¦222460 \add ≈had helped\add* me \add so far\add* and what the king¦222469 had \add ≈given me permission to do\add*.
\p “\add Well,\add* \add ≈let's get started on the rebuilding\add*,” they¦222474 said¦222474, and \add ≈got ready to work together\add*.
\v 19 \add ≈But then\add* Sanvallat the Horonite, and the Ammonite¦222488 servant Toviyyah, and Geshem¦222489 the Arabian¦222490 heard, and they mocked¦222491 and despised¦222493 us, saying, “What \add ≈are you guys all up to\add*? Are you all rebelling¦222506 against¦222503 the king¦222504?”
\p
\v 20 I \add ≈answered them by explaining\add*, “The God¦222513 of the heavens¦222514 will \add ≈help\add* us to succeed¦222516, and we ourselves, his servants¦222519, will \add ≈do the rebuilding work\add*, but you¦222522 all will have \add ≈no part in it, and no rights¦222526\add* in Yerushalem¦222528.”

\s1 The opposition to Nehemyah
\rem /s1 Nehemiah Overcomes Opposition to His Work; Opposition to the Rebuilding; Hostile Plots Thwarted; Enemies Oppose the Rebuilding
\p
\v 1 When Sanballat¦223259 heard¦223258 that we were rebuilding the wall, he got really angry. He mocked the Jews
\v 2 and he spoke before \add ≈in front\add* of his brothers and the army of Samaria, “What are those feeble Jews doing? \add ≈Do they think they'll be able to rebuild that place\add* themselves? Will they sacrifice? Will they \add ≈get finished one\add* day? Will they form the stones \add ≈back together¦223282\add* from piles of dust, when they've been \add ≈weakened by the heat of the fires\add*?”
\p
\v 3 Toviyyah the Ammonite was \add ≈standing beside him and confirmed\add*, “Yes, even if a fox \add ≈walked over\add* that stone wall that they're building, it would make \add ≈it fall down\add*.”
\p
\v 4 \add I prayed,\add* “Our God, \add ≈listen to how we're mocked\add* and cause their \add ≈words\add* to return on their \add own\add* heads and \add ≈send them away as captives to become the plunder for another country\add*.
\v 5 Don't just cover over their evil, and don't¦223319 \add ≈just ignore their sin\add*, because they've \add repeatedly\add* \add ≈made the workers get angry\add*.”
\p
\v 6 \add ≈So¦223341 we kept on at building\add* the wall, and \add eventually\add* all the wall was joined together \add ≈at about half its height\add*, and \add ≈so the people were encouraged to keep persevering\add*.
\p
\v 7 \add ≈Now\add* when Sanballat, and Toviyyah, and the Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites heard that the Yerushalem walls \add ≈were getting repaired\add* and the breaks were beginning to be closed up, it \add ≈made them extremely angry\add*
\v 8 and they all got together to come to \add ≈attack\add* Yerushalem and \add ≈to throw us into confusion\add*.
\v 9 \add ≈So\add* we¦223427 prayed to our¦223414 God, \add ≈as well as setting up a 24-hour guard to watch out for\add* them.
\p
\v 10 \add ≈People around Yehudah¦223458\add* said, “The \add ≈workers are running out of\add* strength and there's \add ≈a lot of\add* rubble \add still to be moved\add*. \add ≈Maybe we're not up to building this\add* wall.”
\p
\v 11 Then \add ≈those against us\add* said, “\add ≈We'll rush in among them and kill some of them before they even see us or know that we're coming\add*, then \add ≈that will bring the work to an end\add*.”
\v 12 \add ≈After\add* that, whenever the Jews living close to them came, they \add ≈repeatedly warned us\add*, “\add ≈They're going to attack us from all directions\add*.”
\v 13 \add ≈So\add* I stationed \add guards\add* behind the lowest places along the wall \add ≈and where there were still gaps\add*. I \add also\add* \add ≈made sure that the families stood guard\add* with their swords, spears, and bows.
\p
\v 14 I looked then I \add ≈got organised\add* and told the nobles and the prefects, and the rest of the people, “Don't be afraid of their \add ≈threats\add*. Remember my \add ≈powerful\add* and fearsome master, and fight¦223523 for your brothers, your sons and your daughters, your wives, and your houses.”
\v 15 \add ≈After all that\add*, when our enemies \add ≈realised that we were aware of their intentions and that God had frustrated their surprise attack plan\add*, \add ≈we all returned to our work on\add* the wall.
\p
\v 16 \add ≈So from that day¦223555 onwards\add*, half of my young men would \add ≈work on the rebuilding, while the other half stood guard¦223554 with\add* spears, shields, and breastplates, and the officials \add ≈encouraged them all from behind\add*.
\v 17 \add Both¦223560\add* those who were \add ≈placing the stones on\add* the wall and those who were carrying the heavy loads \add to them\add*, \add always\add* \add ≈had their weapons¦223573 with them\add* \add in case of an attack\add*.
\v 18 The builders \add ≈had their swords strapped to their sides as they worked\add*, and \add ≈the man who would sound the trumpet stayed with\add* me.
\v 19 Then I told the nobles and prefects, and the rest of the people, “\add ≈This job is so large and extensive that we're all separated from each other when we work on\add* the wall,
\v 20 \add so\add* whenever you all hear the trumpet blast, join us at that place. Our God will fight for us.”
\v 21 \add ≈So\add* we \add ≈continued the work with\add* half of them keeping their hands on their spears from the \add ≈beginning of the day\add* until the stars came out \add at night\add*.
\p
\v 22 Also at that time, I told the people, “\add ≈Every worker including servants should spend the night inside the city, so they double as workers during the day and guards at\add* night.”

\v 1 \add ≈However¦223585\add* \add around then,\add* there was a \add ≈widespread complaint from\add* the people¦223579 and their wives¦223580 against¦223582 \add ≈what their fellow Jews were doing\add*.
\v 2 \add ≈Some of them complained\add*, “\add ≈There's a lot of us when we include\add* our sons¦223590 and daughters¦223591. \add ≈We need\add* grain¦223595 so we can eat¦223596 and \add ≈stay alive\add*.”
\p
\v 3 \add ≈Others\add* said, “We are mortgaging¦223606 our fields¦223602 and vineyards¦223603, and our houses¦223604 so we¦223605 can get grain¦223608 during this famine¦223609.”
\p
\v 4 \add ≈Yet others\add* said, “We've borrowed¦223614 silver \add to pay the tax¦223616\add* on our fields¦223618 and our vineyards¦223619 \add ≈that goes to the tribute to be paid to\add* the \add foreign\add* king¦223617.
\v 5 \add ≈We're Jews just like our countrymen, but we're having to commit our children into bondage as slaves¦223636—yes, even\add* our daughters. \add ≈Now we own nothing at all—not even\add* our fields¦223643 and vineyards¦223644.
\p
\v 6 I got very angry when I heard¦223651 their¦223654 \add ≈complaints and¦223655 desperation\add*,
\v 7 and \add ≈I couldn't get it out of my mind¦223660\add*. I \add ≈protested\add* to the nobles¦223665 and the officials¦223668, “You guys are \add ≈charging interest against¦223682 your own countrymen\add*.”\x + \xo 5:7: \xt Exo 22:25; Lev 25:35-37; Deu 23:19-20.\x*
\p \add ≈So¦223659 I called¦223681 for a gathering of all the people to deal with\add* them,
\v 8 and I told them, “Our brothers, the Jews, were sold to \add other\add* countries¦223695 \add as slaves\add* \add ≈and we've done all we can to bring them back here\add*. But¦223686 now even you yourselves are buying and selling your own countrymen \add to make a profit\add*.” They \add ≈couldn't argue against that, so they were just\add* silent¦223708.
\p
\v 9 “It's not good¦223720 what you're doing¦223725,” I \add ≈continued\add*. “Shouldn't you all \add ≈respect and obey\add* our God¦223728, because \add ≈otherwise we'll be despised by the other\add* nations¦223731, our enemies¦223732.
\v 10 I¦223736 myself have lent them money¦223741 and grain¦223742, as have my brothers¦223737 and my young men, \add but\add* please¦223745 let's forgo charging interest¦223748.
\v 11 Please, even today, return their fields¦223755 to them, and their vineyards¦223756 and olive¦223757 orchards, their houses¦223758, and \add ≈the interest on\add* the money¦223760 and the grain¦223761, the new wine, and the oil that you¦223765 are charging against them.”
\p
\v 12 “\add ≈Okay, we'll do what you're asking\add*,” they \add ≈responded¦223769\add*. “We'll return¦223770 \add >their property\add* and we \add ≈won't impose any more charges on\add* them.”
\p \add ≈So¦223769\add* I called¦223779 the priests¦223782 \add ≈to witness those nobles and officials making an oath to do what they'd said¦223769 they would do\add*.
\v 13 Also I shook¦223791 \add ≈the folds¦223790 of my robe¦223790\add* and told \add >them\add*, “May God shake you all out of his house¦223809 like that, and \add ≡shake\add* \add ≈every man's business if he doesn't do what he just promised¦223826\add*—may he be shaken¦223813 out like that and \add ≈lose everything\add*.”

\v 14 Also, from the day¦223830 that I was appointed¦223834 to be their¦223837 governor in the Yehudah¦223839 region (for the twelve years¦223848 from \add the Persian\add* King Artahshashta's 20th year until his 32nd year), I myself didn't \add ≈accept the governor's food allowance\add*, nor did my \add ≈relatives\add*.
\v 15 The governors¦223858 who preceded me had been very \add ≈hard\add* on the people—\add ≈demanding\add* bread and wine and forty¦223875 silver¦223872 coins. Even their¦223877 servants¦223877 \add ≈oppressed\add* the people. \add In contrast,\add* I didn't do that \add ≈due to desire to honour\add* God¦223889.
\v 16 Also I \add ≈remained focussed on rebuilding the\add* wall, and we¦223898 \add ≈didn't invest in a farm property\add*, and all my servants¦223901 \add ≈also contributed\add* to the work.
\v 17 \add ≈I regularly fed a hundred¦223910 and fifty¦223911 Jewish leaders and city officials¦223909, as well as visitors from other countries¦223917\add* around¦223920 us,
\v 18 \add ≈so in one day¦223928 we needed\add* one bull, six¦223933 choice sheep¦223932, \add ≈and various kinds of poultry\add*, as well as various types of wines every ten¦223941 days¦223942. \add ≈I¦223953 didn't demand any of this from the people¦223960 because it would have been a heavy¦223956 burden¦223957 for them\add*.

\v 1 Although we didn't yet have any doors¦224002 in the gates¦224006, when Sanballat¦223981 and Toviyyah and Geshem¦223983 the Arabian¦223984 and the rest of our enemies¦223986 heard¦223980 that we'd finished building the wall so it didn't have any gaps left in it,
\v 2 Sanballat¦224009 and Geshem¦224010 \add ≈invited\add* me, “We'd like to arrange to meet with you in one of the villages¦224016 on the Ono¦224018 plain¦224017.” \add ≈But¦224008\add* they¦224019 were \add ≈intending to harm\add* me.
\v 3 \add ≈So¦224025\add* I sent¦224025 messengers¦224027 \add back\add* to them, “\add ≈This work is important and extensive, so I can't afford to abandon it and have the work stop if I travelled down to you on the plain\add*.”
\p
\v 4 They \add ≈tried four¦224048 times¦224049 to get me to go, but I kept refusing them for those same¦224053 reasons\add*.
\p
\v 5 Then Sanballat¦224058 sent his servant¦224065 to me a fifth¦224062 time \add ≈with the same request, but this time in an unsealed, open letter¦224066\add*
\v 6 saying¦224075, “\add ≈There's rumours flying around in nearby\add* countries¦224072, and Geshem¦224074 \add ≈confirms it\add*, that you and the Jews are building the wall because you're all plotting thinking to rebel¦224079. Then you'd become¦224087 their king¦224089, according¦224090 to \add ≈what we're hearing\add*.
\v 7 \add ≈We've also heard that\add* you've set up ‘prophets¦224095’ to speak out in Yerushalem¦224099 to say about you, ‘There's a king in Yehudah¦224102.’ By now, all of that will have been heard by the \add Persian\add* king. \add ≈So¦224093\add* now, come and let's \add ≈discuss this\add* together¦224111.”
\p
\v 8 I sent¦224114 \add ≈a message straight back\add*, “\add ≈None of what you're saying¦224123 is true. It's simply your¦224125 own imagination at work\add*.”
\p
\v 9 \add We knew that\add* they were just trying to frighten us \add ≈so that we'd stop the repairs and it would never get finished\add*.
\mi \add My God,\add* strengthen¦224143 my hands.
\p
\v 10 \add After that,\add* I entered Shemayah's¦224152 house (the son of Mehetav'el's son Delayah¦224155) who was confined \add to his house\add*, and he said, “Let's set a time to meet in the temple—we'll shut the temple doors¦224172 because they'll be coming to kill you—probably in the night¦224177.”
\p
\v 11 \add ≈But¦224181 I disagreed\add*, “Would a man¦224182 like me run away? \add ≈Besides that, who's allowed to live inside the temple¦224192\add*? I won't \add ≈do that\add*.”
\p
\v 12 \add ≈Then¦224197 I suddenly realised that God¦224201 hadn't told him to say that, but rather he was working against¦224206 me because he'd been paid by\add* Toviyyah and Sanballat¦224208.
\v 13 \add ≈They must have hired¦224212 him\add* so that I'd be afraid¦224216 and \add ≈take that advice\add* and sin¦224220. \add ≈Then they could have ruined my reputation and discredited\add* me.
\mi
\v 14 My God¦224230, remember¦224229 what Toviyyah and Sanballat¦224232 have done, and also the prophetess Noadyah¦224236 and the other prophets who've been \add ≈trying to scare me\add*.

\p
\v 15 \add ≈So¦224245\add* \add the rebuilding of\add* the wall was finished on the 25th of September in \add just\add* fifty-two days,
\v 16 and when our enemies¦224260 heard¦224257 \add about it\add*, the surrounding¦224266 countries¦224264 were afraid \add ≈and discouraged\add* because they realised that our God¦224273 \add ≈must have helped us\add*.
\p
\v 17 \add ≈During that time\add*, the Yehudah¦224284 nobles¦224283 were \add ≈sending many\add* letters to Toviyyah, and¦224290 \add ≡letters\add* from Toviyyah were \add also\add* coming¦224292 to them,
\v 18 because many \add people\add* in Yehudah¦224298 \add ≈had ties with him\add* because he was the son-in-law of Arah's¦224309 son Shekanyah, plus his son Yehohanan¦224310 had \add ≈married\add* Berekyah's¦224319 daughter¦224315 Meshullam¦224317.
\v 19 \add @Those nobles\add* kept telling¦224324 me \add ≈about the good¦224322 things he¦224331 was doing\add*, and they reported my words¦224326 \add back\add* to him. Toviyyah¦224332 \add also\add* sent¦224331 letters¦224330 to \add try to\add* frighten me.
\c 7
\p
\v 1 \add ≈Once\add* the wall had been rebuilt¦224337 and the doors¦224340 \add ≈hung\add* in the gates, the gatekeepers¦224342 and the singers¦224343 and the Levites¦224344 had been appointed¦224341.
\v 2 I put my brother¦224350 Hanani¦224349 and the fortress commander¦224354 Hananyah in charge over Yerushalem¦224358. (Hananyah was a faithful¦224363 man¦224362 and \add ≈respected\add* God more than many \add others do\add*.)
\v 3 I told them, “Don't open Yerushalem's¦224376 gates¦224375 until¦224377 \add ≈broad daylight\add*, and then shut and bar them again while \add ≈the guards¦224383 are still on full alert\add*.
