\mt2 The first letter
\mt2 that we have written by
\mt1 John
\is1 Introduction
\ip This \bk First letter of John\bk* had two purposes: 1.) encouraging the readers about God and his son Yeshua the messiah; and 2.) warning them that it's important to not follow false or incorrect teachings that can destroy their unity with the master. These false teachers stated that Yeshua didn't become a person like us. They also taught that salvation doesn't include godly living and the love of others.
\ip So in refuting those false doctrines, John carefully explained that Yeshua the messiah came to this world as a real person, and he also explained that all who believe in Yeshua and love God, must also demonstrate their love to each other.

\s1 The message that is life
\p
\v 1-3 We are reporting to you and testifying about what existed from the beginning¦152784:\x + \xo 1:1: \xt Jn 1:1.\x*\bdit Yeshua the messiah and son of God\bdit*. We heard him, we saw him with our own eyes¦152790, and we touched¦152798 him with our own hands¦152796. Concerning the message¦152801 of life, we can also report and testify to you that that life was revealed\x + \xo 1:2: \xt Jn 1:14.\x*—\add he is\add* the eternal life that was with the father and was revealed to us. We report what we've seen and what we've heard so that you all also can have fellowship with us, and our fellowship is with the father and with his son.
\v 4 We're writing¦152865 all this so that our¦152871 joy¦152870 may be extended to you also.
\s1 We're all sinners
\p
\v 5 This is the message¦152885 that we heard¦152887 from him and which¦152886 we are declaring¦152891 to you all: God¦152896 is light¦152897 and there is no darkness¦152900 in him—none at all.
\v 6 If we say¦152910 that we and him¦152915 are relating well together and yet we're walking¦152920 in the darkness¦152919, then we're lying¦152921 and not living the truth¦152927.
\v 7 But if we're walking¦152933 in the light, just like he walks in the light, then we'll get along well with each other, and his¦152951 son Yeshua's¦152947 blood¦152946 is removing the consequences of all our sins.
\p
\v 8 If we say¦152958 that we don't¦152961 have any sin¦152960, then we're \add just\add* fooling ourselves¦152963 and haven't embraced the truth¦152968.
\v 9 \add But\add* if we admit our sins, Yeshua is trustworthy and totally sinless, and he will forgive¦152985 us for our sins and remove all of our guilt and consequences.
\v 10 If we say¦152998 that we haven't sinned¦153001, then we're making¦153003 a liar out of Yeshua and we haven't internalised his¦153008 message¦153007.
\c 2
\s1 The messiah is our advocate
\p
\v 1 I am writing¦153016 to you all, my¦153014 treasured new believers, so that you might avoid sinning. If anyone¦153023 should sin, we have an advocate¦153025 \add to help us relate to\add* the father¦153029: Yeshua¦153030 the sinless messiah¦153031,
\v 2 and it's him who is the atonement¦153035 for our sins—not just our sins, but also the sins of the entire¦153052 world¦153054.
\p
\v 3 We will know if we \add really\add* know Yeshua if we obey his¦153066 teachings.
\v 4 If someone says that they know Yeshua but don't¦153078 do what he taught, that person is a liar and hasn't internalised the truth¦153086.
\v 5 However the person who obeys Yeshua's teaching demonstrates that God's love¦153102 has truly¦153098 been planted in them. We know that we are \add alive\add* in Yeshua if
\v 6 we claim to live in him¦153116 and then live our lives like he¦153113 lived.
\s1 Love not hate to be in the light
\p
\v 7 \x + \xo 2:7: \xt Jn 13:34.\x*Dear friends, I'm not writing¦153131 a new rule for you all, but \add reminding you\add* of an old rule that you had from the beginning¦153139. This old rule is the message¦153146 that you all heard¦153148.
\v 8 Then again I \em am\em* writing¦153154 a new rule to you—a rule which¦153156 is true in Yeshua and in you all, because¦153167 the darkness¦153170 is already disappearing and the true light¦153174 is already shining¦153179.
\p
\v 9 The person who says they're in the light¦153184 but hates a fellow believer,\f + \fr 2:9 \ft Literally ‘our brothers’. In this letter that term could refer to ‘siblings’, ‘fellow believers’, or ‘fellow citizens’ (or John could be alternating between two or three of them in his mind as he wrote). After considering all the uses of the term in chapters 2–5, we have taken ‘fellow believers’ as being more likely, i.e., the context would often seem to be focussing on believers (even though most of us would want to apply 3:16–17 to also include ‘fellow citizens’).\f* is still in the darkness¦153196.
\v 10 It's the person that loves their fellow believers who is living in the light¦153207 and¦153209 doesn't offend¦153210 anyone.
\v 11 But the person who hates a fellow believer is living and walking¦153231 in the darkness and doesn't know where¦153235 they're going¦153236 because¦153237 they're blinded¦153240.
\s1 Don't love the things of this world
\p
\v 12 I'm writing¦153245 to you new believers because your sins¦153253 have been forgiven¦153249 because of Yeshua authority.
\v 13 I'm writing to you fathers¦153260 because you have known¦153262 the messiah from the beginning¦153265.\x + \xo 2:13: \xt Lk 2: 25-35.\x*
\v 14 I wrote to you new believers because you have know the father¦153282. I wrote to you fathers¦153285 because you have known the messiah from the beginning¦153291.\x + \xo 2:13: \xt Lk 2: 25-35.\x*I wrote to you young¦153294 men¦153294 because you are strong¦153296 and God's message¦153300 lives in you and you have overcome¦153307 the evil one.
\p
\v 15 Don't be loving the world nor the things¦153315 in the world. The father's¦153330 love does not live in anyone¦153320 who loves the world
\v 16 because everything that's in the world, bodily desires and lusts and arrogant¦153350 living¦153352, is not from the father¦153357 but from the world.
\v 17 And the world¦153365 will come to an end along with the desire for it¦153370, but¦153372 the person obeying God's desires will continue to live.
\s1 Beware of ‘new’ teaching
\p
\v 18 New believers, it's now the last times and what you¦153391 heard¦153391 about the false messiah coming¦153395 is now happening. Many false messiahs have already been around and that confirms that it's now the last times.
\v 19 They came¦153410 from our¦153415 group, but they were never truly part of us because¦153418 if they were, they would have stayed with us. But they left¦153410 us so it would be revealed¦153429 that they're not part of us.
\p
\v 20 But you all have received the spirit\f + \fr 2:20 \ft anointing: It's not really clear here what John is referring to that they have received: God's favour? a skill or ability? a blessing? the Holy Spirit? But v27 below seems to be talking about God's pure spirit..\f* from the chosen messiah\f + \fr 2:20 \ft holy (one): John seems to be referring to Yeshua here.\f* and you all know all about it.\f + \fr 2:20 \ft You all know all: also unclear what John means.\f*
\v 21 I didn't write to you all because you don't¦153447 know the truth, but because you have known the truth and any falsehood¦153462 is not part of it.
\p
\v 22 Whoever teaches that Yeshua¦153477 is not the messiah is a liar. And anyone who disowns the father¦153491 and¦153492 the son is a false messiah.
\v 23 Anyone who disowns¦153497 the son, doesn't know the father either—only those who confess¦153505 the son know the father
\p
\v 24 What you all heard from the beginning, that's what you should hold to. If the message that you heard from the beginning remains in you, then you also will remain in the son and in the father¦153541,
\v 25 and in that case, what he promised¦153550 us is to live forever.
\p
\v 26 I wrote¦153560 these¦153558 things¦153558 to you all concerning¦153562 those who would mislead¦153564 you.
\v 27 But for you, the spirit that you received¦153572 from Yeshua remains in you all and so you don't¦153581 need anyone¦153585 else to teach you because his¦153593 spirit teaches you about everything. The spirit teaches truth and not lies, and since you were taught¦153611 by the spirit then you are remaining in Yeshua.
\p
\v 28 So now you new believers, remain¦153620 in him so that when he is revealed¦153626, we can have boldness¦153629 and not be ashamed¦153632 of him when he comes \add back\add*.
\v 29 Because you know that he¦153646 is sinless, you also know that anyone faithfully obeying his¦153655 teaching has been \add re\add*born in him¦153656.
\c 3
\s1 Living as God's children
\p
\v 1 \x + \xo 3:1: \xt Jn 1:12.\x*Consider the amazing live that the father¦153667 has given¦153662 to us in order¦153668 that we can be called¦153671 God's children¦153669, and indeed we are.
\v 2 Dear friends we are God's children¦153688 now, but it's not yet revealed what we will become. We know that when Yeshua is revealed, we will be similar¦153701 to him because¦153704 then we'll be seeing¦153705 him exactly as he is.
\v 3 Everyone who trusts their future to him¦153717 needs to purify¦153718 themself just like he is pure.
\p
\v 4 Everyone¦153724 who regularly sins is demonstrating lawlessness, and sin is lawlessness.
\v 5 \x + \xo 3:5: \xt Jn 1:29.\x*You all know that Yeshua was revealed¦153745 in order¦153746 to take¦153750 away sins¦153748, and¦153751 there's no sin¦153752 in him¦153754.
\v 6 Everyone¦153759 who remains¦153763 in him doesn't sin—everyone¦153766 who keeps sinning has neither¦153769 really seen¦153770 Yeshua nor known¦153773 him.
\p
\v 7 So new believers, don't let anyone deceive¦153780 you¦153781: the person faithfully obeying Yeshua's teaching will be declared not guilty just as he¦153782 is not guilty.
\v 8 The person who regularly sins belongs to the devil, because¦153801 the devil has been sinning¦153806 from the beginning¦153803.
\p
\v 9 Everyone¦153820 who's been \add re\add*born in God, doesn't regularly sin because God's seed \add of life\add* remains¦153834 in them and that person isn't able to sin because they have been \add re\add*born in God.
\v 10 You can distinguish God's children and the devil's¦153856 children like this: everyone¦153858 who doesn't faithfully obey Yeshua's teaching or doesn't love their fellow believers, that person doesn't belong to God.
\s1 Demonstrate your love for each other
\p
\v 11 \x + \xo 3:11: \xt Jn 13:34.\x*Yes, this is the message¦153881 that you¦153883 all heard¦153883 from the beginning¦153885: to be loving¦153887 each other—
\v 12 not living like Cain who belonged to the evil one and went on to murder his brother.\x + \xo 3:12: \xt Gen 4:8.\x*And why did he kill him? Because¦153906 his own actions were evil, but his brother \add Abel\add* followed God's instructions.
\p
\v 13 And friends, don't be surprised if the world¦153927 hates you¦153925.
\v 14 \x + \xo 3:14: \xt Jn 5:24.\x*We know that we have transferred from death to life because¦153939 we are loving our fellow¦153942 believers¦153942. The person who doesn't love others is stuck in death.
\v 15 Everyone¦153953 who hates another person is a murderer, and¦153962 you¦153963 all know that murderers don't¦153967 have eternal¦153970 life¦153969 in them.
\v 16 We know about \add real\add* love¦153979 because¦153980 we saw that Yeshua gave up his¦153986 life¦153985 for us, and we should give up our lives¦153995 for our fellow¦153993 believers¦153993.
\v 17 But anyone who's enjoying being alive and notices that a fellow believer is in need yet shuts that other believer's needs out of their conscience, how can God's love¦154022 be living¦154003 in that person?
\v 18 So you new believers, don't¦154030 just proclaim that you're loving¦154031 people, but¦154037 actually demonstrate it in actions and¦154040 in fact.
\v 19 That's how we'll know that the truth¦154050 really is in us.
\p At the same time, we need to tell ourselves
\v 20 that if we are feeling condemned¦154065, God¦154075 is greater¦154071 than our¦154067 feelings and he knows everything.
\v 21 Then dear friends, if we're not feeling condemned¦154092, we have confidence¦154096 in God¦154101
\v 22 and confidence that whatever¦154103 we are requesting¦154106 from him, we will receive¦154108 it because¦154113 we are following his¦154116 instructions and doing the things¦154121 that please¦154121 him.
\v 23 \x + \xo 3:23: \xt Jn 13:34; 15:12,17.\x*And this is his command: We need to believe¦154133 in the authority of his son, Yeshua the messiah¦154140, and we should love each other as per the command that Yeshua gave¦154146 to us.
\v 24 Whoever follows his¦154154 commands¦154153 is living in him, and he is living in them and we have confirmation that he is living in us, because we have the spirit¦154172 that he gave¦154175 to us.
\c 4
\s1 True and false spirits
\p
\v 1 Dear friends, don't¦154180 trust every¦154181 spirit¦154182, but¦154185 test them to determine whether¦154189 or not it's from God¦154192, because¦154194 many false¦154196 prophets¦154196 go around the world¦154200.
\v 2 You all can find out whether or not a spirit is from God: If the spirit confesses¦154218 that Yeshua¦154220 the messiah¦154221 has come as a person, then it's from God
\v 3 but if the spirit won't confess¦154235 Yeshua¦154237, then it's not from God¦154245 but rather it's the spirit of the false messiah, whom you've heard¦154256 is coming¦154259, and is now already¦154266 in the world¦154264.
\p
\v 4 You new believers are in God¦154270 and you have defeated the \add false prophets\add*, because¦154276 the one in you is more powerful than the one in the world¦154286.
\v 5 They belong to the world hence they¦154297 are speaking¦154297 from the world, and¦154298 the world is listening to them.
\v 6 However we belong to God, and anyone who knows God listens to us, but anyone who doesn't belong to God can't accept what we're saying. That's how we can distinguish the spirit of truth¦154331 from deceptive¦154336 spirits.
\s1 Loving God means loving others
\p
\v 7 Dear friends, we need to be loving each other, because¦154340 love is from God and everyone¦154348 who \add truly\add* loves has been \add re\add*born into God and knows God.
\v 8 Those who don't love, don't love God because¦154370 God is love.
\v 9 God's love¦154379 was revealed¦154377 to us when he sent¦154390 his¦154387 only son to be born into the world¦154395 so that we can live¦154397 through¦154399 him.
\v 10 So this is \add real\add* love¦154405, not us loving God, but¦154416 God loving us and¦154422 sending his¦154427 son to be the sacrifice to clear us of the sentence from our¦154432 sins¦154431.
\p
\v 11 Dear friends, if God¦154437 loves us like that, we¦154441 ought¦154442 to be loving¦154444 each other.
\v 12 \x + \xo 4:12: \xt Jn 1:18.\x*No one has ever seen¦154448 God, but when we¦154452 are loving¦154452 each other then God is living in us, and¦154459 his¦154462 love¦154461 is being perfected¦154463 in us.
\p
\v 13 We can know that we are living in him and him in us because¦154480 he has given¦154485 to us from his¦154484 spirit¦154483.
\v 14 And we¦154489 have seen¦154490 and¦154492 are testifying¦154493 that the father¦154496 sent¦154497 the son—the saviour¦154500 of the world¦154502.
\v 15 Whoever¦154503 confesses¦154506 that Yeshua¦154509 is God's son, God lives in that person and¦154521 they live in God.
\v 16 We have known¦154530 and experienced the love that God has in us.
\p God is love, and whoever lives in love, lives in God, and God lives in them.
\v 17 This how love¦154567 will be perfected¦154565 in us so that we can live with confidence¦154573 about the \add coming\add* judgement day¦154578: we live like Yeshua in this world¦154592.
\v 18 There's no fear in love, but rather perfect love drives away fear, because¦154608 our fear is that of being punished¦154611 but the one fearing¦154615 has not been perfected in love.
\p
\v 19 We love others because¦154627 he¦154630 loved¦154632 us first¦154631.
\v 20 Anyone who says that they are loving God but hates a fellow believer, that person is liar because¦154649 if someone can't love a fellow believer that they've seen, they can't love God who they've never seen.
\v 21 So we¦154670 have this command¦154669 from Yeshua that anyone who loves God¦154679 must also love their fellow believers.
\c 5
\s1 Faith and love overcome the world
\p
\v 1 Everyone¦154685 who believes¦154687 the Yeshua¦154689 is the messiah¦154692 has been \add re\add*born in God¦154695, and everyone¦154698 who loves the father who gave birth to us, also loves the son that he gave birth to.
\v 2 We can know when we love God's children¦154716: whenever¦154719 we love God and obey his¦154726 commands¦154725,
\v 3 because the definition of loving God¦154735\x + \xo 5:3: \xt Jn 14:15.\x*is obeying his commands and¦154741 his commands are not a big strain on us
\v 4 because¦154748 everyone¦154749 who's been \add re\add*born in God¦154754 is overcoming¦154755 the world.
\v 5 So who can overcome¦154776 the world¦154778? Only the person who believes¦154782 that Yeshua¦154784 is God's son.
\s1 God's testimony about Yeshua
\p
\v 6 Yeshua¦154800 the messiah¦154802 is the one who was born by water and blood and spirit—not by water only\x + \xo 5:6: \xt Jn 3:5-8.\x*, but by water and by blood
\v 7 because there are three¦154833 that testify¦154836:
\v 8 the spirit¦154863, the water¦154866, and the blood¦154869, and these three¦154872 come together into one.
\v 9 If we accept testimonies from people, then God's testimony is better, because¦154891 God's testimony is about his¦154904 son.
\v 10 Any person that believes that \add Yeshua is\add* God's son has internalised God's testimony, but whoever doesn't believe in God calls him a liar because¦154929 they have not believed the testimony of God himself¦154918 about his¦154943 son.
\v 11 And this is the testimony¦154948: that God¦154955 gave eternal¦154951 life to us\x + \xo 5:11: \xt Jn 3:36.\x*and this life is in his¦154965 son.
\v 12 Whoever has the son has life, but whoever doesn't have the God's son, doesn't have \add eternal\add* life.
\s1 Living without ending
\p
\v 13 I wrote¦154986 these¦154985 things¦154985 to you so that you all could know that you have eternal¦154993 life¦154991, that is the ones believed¦154997 in the name¦155001 and authority of God's son.
\v 14 And so we have confidence¦155027 in God that if we request¦155037 anything¦155036 according¦155038 to his¦155042 will, he hears us
\v 15 whatever¦155053 we're requesting¦155056, and we know that we'll receive what we requested¦155065.
\p
\v 16 If anyone¦155070 sees a fellow believer committing a forgiveable sin, then that person should ask God on their behalf and God will give life to that fellow believer. (But there is a sin that \add always\add* results in death and I'm not suggesting that we should ask in that case.)
\v 17 All disobedience is sin, but there¦155109 are sins that don't¦155111 \add necessarily\add* lead to death¦155113.
\p
\v 18 We know that everyone¦155116 who's been \add re\add*born into God doesn't keep sinning¦155123, but¦155124 the \add messiah\add* who was born from God watches over them and¦155133 so the evil¦155135 one can't touch¦155137 them.
\p
\v 19 We know that we¦155144 belong to God¦155143 and¦155145 that the whole¦155148 word is under the control of the evil¦155151 one.
\p
\v 20 We know that God's son has come and helped our minds so that we could know the true one, and we are in the true one and \add also\add* in his¦155183 son, Yeshua¦155184 the messiah¦155186—the true God and eternal¦155196 life¦155195 \add itself\add*.
\p
\v 21 You new believers, don't honour idols¦155203.
