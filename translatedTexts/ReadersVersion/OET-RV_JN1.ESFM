\mt2 The first letter
\mt2 that we have written by
\mt1 John
\is1 Introduction
\ip This \bk First letter of John\bk* had two purposes: 1.) encouraging the readers about God and his son Jesus the messiah; and 2.) warning them that it's important to not follow false or incorrect teachings that can destroy their unity with the master. These false teachers stated that Jesus didn't become a person like us. They also taught that salvation doesn't include godly living and the love of others.
\ip So in refuting those false doctrines, John carefully explained that Jesus the messiah came to this world as a real person, and he also explained that all who believe in Jesus and love God, must also demonstrate their love to each other.

\s1 The message that is life
\p
\v 1-3 We are reporting to you and testifying about what existed from the beginning¦152783:\x + \xo 1:1: \xt Jn 1:1.\x* \bdit Jesus the messiah and son of God\bdit*. We heard him, we saw him with our own eyes¦152789, and we touched¦152797 him with our own hands¦152795. Concerning the message¦152800 of life, we can also report and testify to you that that life was revealed\x + \xo 1:2: \xt Jn 1:14.\x*—\add he is\add* the eternal life that was with the father and was revealed to us. We report what we've seen and what we've heard so that you all also can have fellowship with us, and our fellowship is with the father and with his¦152796 son.
\v 4 We're writing¦152864 all this so that our¦152870 joy¦152869 may be extended to you also.
\s1 We're all sinners
\p
\v 5 This is the message¦152884 that we heard¦152886 from him and which¦152885 we are declaring¦152890 to you all: God is light¦152896 and there is no darkness¦152899 in him—none at all.
\v 6 If we say¦152909 that we and him¦152914 are relating well together and yet we're walking¦152919 in the darkness¦152918, then we're lying¦152920 and not living the truth¦152926.
\v 7 But if we're walking¦152932 in the light, just like he walks in the light, then we'll get along well with each other, and his¦152950 son Jesus' blood¦152945 is removing the consequences of all our¦152950 sins.
\p
\v 8 If we say¦152957 that we don't have any sin¦152959, then we're \add just\add* fooling ourselves¦152962 and haven't embraced the truth¦152967.
\v 9 \add But\add* if we admit our sins, Jesus is trustworthy and totally sinless, and he will forgive¦152984 us for our sins and remove all of our guilt and consequences.
\v 10 If we say¦152997 that we haven't sinned¦153000, then we're making¦153002 a liar out of Jesus and we haven't internalised his¦153007 message¦153006.
\c 2
\s1 The messiah is our intermediary
\p
\v 1 I am writing¦153015 to you all, my¦153013 treasured new believers, so that you might avoid sinning. If anyone¦153022 should sin, we have an intermediary between us and the father¦153028: Jesus the sinless messiah¦153030,
\v 2 and it's him who is the atonement¦153034 for our sins—not just our sins, but also the sins of the entire world¦153053.
\p
\v 3 We will know if we \add really\add know Jesus if we obey his¦153065 teachings.
\v 4 If someone says that they know Jesus but don't do what he taught, that person is a liar and hasn't internalised the truth¦153085.
\v 5 However the person who obeys Jesus' teaching demonstrates that God's love¦153101 has truly¦153097 been planted in them. We know that we are \add alive\add* in Jesus if
\v 6 we claim to live in him¦153115 and then live our lives like he¦153112 lived.
\s1 Love not hate to be in the light
\p
\v 7 \x + \xo 2:7: \xt Jn 13:34.\x*Dear friends, I'm not writing¦153130 a new rule for you all, but \add reminding you\add* of an old rule that you had from the beginning¦153138. This old rule is the message¦153145 that you all heard¦153147.
\v 8 Then again I \em am\em* writing¦153153 a new rule to you—a rule which¦153155 is true in Jesus and in you all, because¦153166 the darkness¦153169 is already disappearing and the true light¦153173 is already shining¦153178.
\p
\v 9 The person who says they're in the light¦153183 but hates a fellow believer,\f + \fr 2:9 \ft Literally ‘our brothers’. In this letter that term could refer to ‘siblings’, ‘fellow believers’, or ‘fellow citizens’ (or John could be alternating between two or three of them in his mind as he wrote). After considering all the uses of the term in chapters 2–5, we have taken ‘fellow believers’ as being more likely, i.e., the context would often seem to be focussing on believers (even though most of us would want to apply 3:16–17 to also include ‘fellow citizens’).\f* is still in the darkness¦153195.
\v 10 It's the person that loves their fellow believers who is living in the light¦153206 and¦153208 doesn't offend¦153209 anyone.
\v 11 But the person who hates a fellow believer is living and walking¦153230 in the darkness and doesn't know where¦153234 they're going¦153235 because¦153236 they're blinded¦153239.
\s1 Don't love the things of this world
\p
\v 12 I'm writing¦153244 to you new believers because your¦153256 sins¦153252 have been forgiven¦153248 because of Jesus authority.
\v 13 I'm writing to you fathers¦153259 because you have known¦153261 the messiah from the beginning¦153264.\x + \xo 2:13: \xt Lk 2: 25-35.\x*
\v 14 I wrote to you new believers because you have know the father¦153281. I wrote to you fathers¦153284 because you have known the messiah from the beginning¦153290.\x + \xo 2:13: \xt Lk 2: 25-35.\x* I wrote to you young¦153293 men¦153293 because you are strong¦153295 and God's message¦153299 lives in you and you have overcome¦153306 the evil one.
\p
\v 15 Don't be loving the world nor the things¦153314 in the world. The father's¦153329 love does not live in anyone¦153319 who loves the world
\v 16 because everything that's in the world, bodily desires and lusts and arrogant¦153349 living¦153351, is not from the father¦153356 but from the world.
\v 17 And the world¦153364 will come to an end along with the desire for it¦153369, but¦153371 the person obeying God's desires will continue to live.
\s1 Beware of ‘new’ teaching
\p
\v 18 New believers, it's now the last times and what you¦153390 heard¦153390 about the false messiah coming¦153394 is now happening. Many false messiahs have already been around and that confirms that it's now the last times.
\v 19 They came¦153409 from our¦153414 group, but they were never truly part of us because if they were, they would have stayed with us. But they left us so it would be revealed¦153428 that they're not part of us.
\p
\v 20 But you all have received the spirit\f + \fr 2:20 \ft anointing: It's not really clear here what John is referring to that they have received: God's favour? a skill or ability? a blessing? the Holy Spirit? But v27 below seems to be talking about God's pure spirit..\f* from the chosen messiah\f + \fr 2:20 \ft holy (one): John seems to be referring to Jesus here.\f* and you all know all about it.\f + \fr 2:20 \ft You all know all: also unclear what John means.\f*
\v 21 I didn't write to you all because you don't know the truth, but because you have known the truth and any falsehood¦153461 is not part of it.
\p
\v 22 Whoever teaches that Jesus is not the messiah is a liar. And anyone who disowns the father¦153490 and¦153491 the son is a false messiah.
\v 23 Anyone who disowns¦153496 the son, doesn't know the father either—only those who confess¦153504 the son know the father
\p
\v 24 What you all heard from the beginning, that's what you should hold to. If the message that you heard from the beginning remains¦153524 in you, then you also will remain¦153524 in the son and in the father¦153540,
\v 25 and in that case, what he promised¦153549 us is to live forever.
\p
\v 26 I wrote¦153559 these¦153557 things¦153557 to you all concerning¦153561 those who would mislead¦153563 you.
\v 27 But for you, the spirit that you received¦153571 from Jesus remains in you all and so you don't need anyone¦153584 else to teach you because his¦153592 spirit teaches you about everything. The spirit teaches truth and not lies, and since you were taught¦153610 by the spirit then you are remaining in Jesus.
\p
\v 28 So now you new believers, remain¦153619 in him so that when he is revealed¦153625, we can have boldness¦153628 and not be ashamed¦153631 of him when he comes \add back\add*.
\v 29 Because you know that he¦153645 is sinless, you also know that anyone faithfully obeying his¦153654 teaching has been \add re\add*born in him¦153655.
\c 3
\s1 Living as God's children
\p
\v 1 \x + \xo 3:1: \xt Jn 1:12.\x*Consider the amazing live that the father¦153666 has given¦153661 to us in order¦153667 that we can be called¦153670 God's children¦153668, and indeed we are.
\v 2 Dear friends we are God's children¦153687 now, but it's not yet revealed what we will become. We know that when Jesus is revealed, we will be similar¦153700 to him because¦153703 then we'll be seeing¦153704 him exactly as he is.
\v 3 Everyone who trusts their future to him¦153716 needs to purify¦153717 themself just like he is pure.
\p
\v 4 Everyone¦153723 who regularly sins is demonstrating lawlessness, and sin is lawlessness.
\v 5 \x + \xo 3:5: \xt Jn 1:29.\x*You all know that Jesus was revealed¦153744 in order¦153745 to take¦153749 away sins¦153747, and¦153750 there's no sin¦153751 in him¦153753.
\v 6 Everyone¦153758 who remains¦153762 in him doesn't sin—everyone¦153765 who keeps sinning has neither¦153768 really seen¦153769 Jesus nor known¦153772 him.
\p
\v 7 So new believers, don't let anyone deceive¦153779 you¦153780: the person faithfully obeying Jesus' teaching will be declared not guilty just as he¦153781 is not guilty.
\v 8 The person who regularly sins belongs to the devil, because¦153800 the devil has been sinning¦153805 from the beginning¦153802.
\p
\v 9 Everyone¦153819 who's been \add re\add*born in God, doesn't regularly sin because God's seed \add of life\add* remains¦153833 in them and that person isn't able to sin because they have been \add re\add*born in God.
\v 10 You can distinguish God's children and the devil's¦153855 children like this: everyone¦153857 who doesn't faithfully obey Jesus' teaching or doesn't love their¦153854 fellow believers, that person doesn't belong to God.
\s1 Demonstrate your love for each other
\p
\v 11 \x + \xo 3:11: \xt Jn 13:34.\x*Yes, this is the message¦153880 that you¦153882 all heard¦153882 from the beginning¦153884: to be loving¦153886 each other—
\v 12 not living like Cain who belonged to the evil one and went on to murder his brother.\x + \xo 3:12: \xt Gen 4:8.\x* And why did he kill him? Because¦153905 his own actions were evil, but his brother \add Abel\add* followed God's instructions.
\p
\v 13 And friends, don't be surprised if the world¦153926 hates you¦153924.
\v 14 \x + \xo 3:14: \xt Jn 5:24.\x*We know that we have transferred from death to life because¦153938 we are loving our fellow believers. The person who doesn't love others is stuck in death.
\v 15 Everyone¦153952 who hates another person is a murderer, and¦153961 you¦153962 all know that murderers don't have eternal¦153969 life¦153968 in them.
\v 16 We know about \add real\add* love¦153978 because¦153979 we saw that Jesus gave up his¦153985 life¦153984 for us, and we should give up our lives¦153994 for our fellow believers.
\v 17 But anyone who's enjoying being alive and notices that a fellow believer is in need yet shuts that other believer's needs out of their¦154009 conscience, how can God's love¦154021 be living¦154002 in that person?
\v 18 So you new believers, don't just proclaim that you're loving¦154030 people, but¦154036 actually demonstrate it in actions and¦154039 in fact.
\v 19 That's how we'll know that the truth¦154049 really is in us.
\p At the same time, we need to tell ourselves
\v 20 that if we are feeling condemned¦154064, God is greater¦154070 than our¦154066 feelings and he knows everything.
\v 21 Then dear friends, if we're not feeling condemned¦154091, we have confidence¦154095 in God
\v 22 and confidence that whatever¦154102 we are requesting¦154105 from him, we will receive¦154107 it because¦154112 we are following his¦154115 instructions and doing the things¦154120 that please¦154120 him.
\v 23 \x + \xo 3:23: \xt Jn 13:34; 15:12,17.\x*And this is his command: We need to believe¦154132 in the authority of his son, Jesus the messiah¦154139, and we should love each other as per the command that Jesus gave¦154145 to us.
\v 24 Whoever follows his¦154153 commands¦154152 is living in him, and he is living in them and we have confirmation that he is living in us, because we have the spirit¦154171 that he gave¦154174 to us.
\c 4
\s1 True and false spirits
\p
\v 1 Dear friends, don't trust every¦154180 spirit¦154181, but¦154184 test them to determine whether¦154188 or not it's from God, because¦154193 many false¦154195 prophets¦154195 go around the world¦154199.
\v 2 You all can find out whether or not a spirit is from God: If the spirit confesses¦154217 that Jesus the messiah¦154220 has come as a person, then it's from God
\v 3 but if the spirit won't confess¦154234 Jesus, then it's not from God but rather it's the spirit of the false messiah, whom you've heard¦154255 is coming¦154258, and is now already¦154265 in the world¦154263.
\p
\v 4 You new believers are in God and you have defeated the \add false prophets\add*, because¦154275 the one in you is more powerful than the one in the world¦154285.
\v 5 They belong to the world hence they¦154296 are speaking¦154296 from the world, and¦154297 the world is listening to them.
\v 6 However we belong to God, and anyone who knows God listens to us, but anyone who doesn't belong to God can't accept what we're saying. That's how we can distinguish the spirit of truth¦154330 from deceptive¦154335 spirits.
\s1 Loving God means loving others
\p
\v 7 Dear friends, we need to be loving each other, because¦154339 love is from God and everyone¦154347 who \add truly\add* loves has been \add re\add*born into God and knows God.
\v 8 Those who don't love, don't love God because¦154369 God is love.
\v 9 God's love¦154378 was revealed¦154376 to us when he sent¦154389 his¦154386 only son to be born into the world¦154394 so that we can live¦154396 through¦154398 him.
\v 10 So this is \add real\add* love¦154404, not us loving God, but¦154415 God loving us and¦154421 sending his¦154426 son to be the sacrifice to clear us of the sentence from our¦154431 sins¦154430.
\p
\v 11 Dear friends, if God loves us like that, we¦154440 ought¦154441 to be loving¦154443 each other.
\v 12 \x + \xo 4:12: \xt Jn 1:18.\x*No one has ever seen¦154447 God, but when we¦154451 are loving¦154451 each other then God is living in us, and¦154458 his¦154461 love¦154460 is being perfected¦154462 in us.
\p
\v 13 We can know that we are living in him and him in us because¦154479 he has given¦154484 to us from his¦154483 spirit¦154482.
\v 14 And we¦154488 have seen¦154489 and¦154491 are testifying¦154492 that the father¦154495 sent¦154496 the son—the saviour¦154499 of the world¦154501.
\v 15 Whoever¦154502 confesses¦154505 that Jesus is God's son, God lives in that person and¦154520 they live in God.
\v 16 We have known¦154529 and experienced the love that God has in us.
\p God is love, and whoever lives in love, lives in God, and God lives in them.
\v 17 This how love¦154566 will be perfected¦154564 in us so that we can live with confidence¦154572 about the \add coming\add* judgement day¦154577: we live like Jesus in this world¦154591.
\v 18 There's no fear in love, but rather perfect love drives away fear, because¦154607 our fear is that of being punished¦154610 but the one fearing¦154614 has not been perfected in love.
\p
\v 19 We love others because¦154626 he¦154629 loved¦154631 us first¦154630.
\v 20 Anyone who says that they are loving God but hates a fellow believer, that person is liar because if someone can't love a fellow believer that they've seen, they can't love God who they've never seen.
\v 21 So we¦154669 have this command¦154668 from Jesus that anyone who loves God must also love their fellow believers.
\c 5
\s1 Faith and love overcome the world
\p
\v 1 Everyone¦154684 who believes¦154686 the Jesus is the messiah¦154691 has been \add re\add*born in God, and everyone¦154697 who loves the father who gave birth to us, also loves the son that he gave birth to.
\v 2 We can know when we love God's children¦154715: whenever¦154718 we love God and obey his¦154725 commands¦154724,
\v 3 because the definition of loving God\x + \xo 5:3: \xt Jn 14:15.\x* is obeying his commands and¦154740 his commands are not a big strain on us
\v 4 because¦154747 everyone¦154748 who's been \add re\add*born in God is overcoming¦154754 the world.
\v 5 So who can overcome¦154775 the world¦154777? Only the person who believes¦154781 that Jesus is God's son.
\s1 God's testimony about Jesus
\p
\v 6 Jesus the messiah¦154801 is the one who was born by water and blood and spirit—not by water only\x + \xo 5:6: \xt Jn 3:5-8.\x*, but by water and by blood
\v 7 because there are three¦154832 that testify¦154835:
\v 8 the spirit¦154862, the water¦154865, and the blood¦154868, and these three¦154871 come together into one.
\v 9 If we¦154883 accept testimonies from people, then God's testimony is better, because¦154890 God's testimony is about his¦154887 son.
\v 10 Any person that believes that \add Jesus is\add* God's son has internalised God's testimony, but whoever doesn't believe in God calls him a liar because¦154928 they have not believed¦154930 the testimony of God himself¦154917 about his¦154942 son.
\v 11 And this is the testimony¦154947: that God gave eternal¦154950 life to us\x + \xo 5:11: \xt Jn 3:36.\x* and this life is in his¦154964 son.
\v 12 Whoever has the son has life, but whoever doesn't have the God's son, doesn't have \add eternal\add* life.
\s1 Living without ending
\p
\v 13 I wrote¦154985 these¦154984 things¦154984 to you so that you all could know that you have eternal¦154992 life¦154990, that is the ones believed¦154996 in the name¦155000 and authority of God's son.
\v 14 And so we have confidence¦155026 in God that if we request¦155036 anything¦155035 according¦155037 to his¦155041 will, he hears us
\v 15 whatever¦155052 we're requesting¦155055, and we know that we'll receive what we requested¦155064.
\p
\v 16 If anyone¦155069 sees a fellow believer committing a forgiveable sin, then that person should ask God on their behalf and God will give life to that fellow believer. (But there is a sin that \add always\add* results in death and I'm not suggesting that we should ask in that case.)
\v 17 All disobedience is sin, but there¦155108 are sins that don't \add necessarily\add* lead to death¦155112.
\p
\v 18 We know that everyone¦155115 who's been \add re\add*born into God doesn't keep sinning¦155122, but¦155123 the \add messiah\add* who was born from God watches over them and¦155132 so the evil¦155134 one can't touch¦155136 them.
\p
\v 19 We know that we¦155143 belong to God and¦155144 that the whole¦155147 word is under the control of the evil¦155150 one.
\p
\v 20 We know that God's son has come and helped our¦155182 minds so that we could know the true one, and we are in the true one and \add also\add* in his¦155182 son, Jesus the messiah¦155185—the true God and eternal¦155195 life¦155194 \add itself\add*.
\p
\v 21 You new believers, don't honour idols¦155202.
