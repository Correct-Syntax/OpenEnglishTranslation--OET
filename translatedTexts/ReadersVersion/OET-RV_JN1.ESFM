\mt2 The first letter
\mt2 that we have written by
\mt1 John
\is1 Introduction
\ip This \bk First letter of John\bk* had two purposes: 1.) encouraging the readers about God and his son Jesus the messiah; and 2.) warning them that it's important to not follow false or incorrect teachings that can destroy their unity with the master. These false teachers stated that Jesus didn't become a person like us. They also taught that salvation doesn't include godly living and the love of others.
\ip So in refuting those false doctrines, John carefully explained that Jesus the messiah came to this world as a real person, and he also explained that all who believe in Jesus and love God, must also demonstrate their love to each other.

\s1 The message that is life
\p
\v 1-3 We are reporting to you and testifying about what existed from the beginning:\x + \xo 1:1: \xt Jn 1:1.\x* \bdit Jesus the messiah and son of God\bdit*. We heard him, we saw him with our own eyes¦152789, and we touched him with our own hands¦152795. Concerning the message of life, we can also report and testify to you that that life was revealed\x + \xo 1:2: \xt Jn 1:14.\x*—\add he is\add* the eternal life that was with the father and was revealed to us. We report what we've seen and what we've heard so that you all also can have fellowship with us, and our fellowship is with the father and with his son.
\v 4 We're writing¦152864 all this so that our joy¦152869 may be extended to you also.
\s1 We're all sinners
\p
\v 5 This is the message¦152884 that we heard from him and which we are declaring to you all: God is light¦152896 and there is no darkness¦152899 in him—none at all.
\v 6 If we say¦152909 that we and him¦152914 are relating well together and yet we're walking¦152919 in the darkness¦152918, then we're lying and not living the truth¦152926.
\v 7 But if we're walking in the light, just like he walks in the light, then we'll get along well with each other, and his son Jesus' blood¦152945 is removing the consequences of all our sins.
\p
\v 8 If we say¦152957 that we don't have any sin¦152959, then we're \add just\add* fooling ourselves and haven't embraced the truth¦152967.
\v 9 \add But\add* if we admit our sins, Jesus is trustworthy and totally sinless, and he will forgive us for our sins and remove all of our guilt and consequences.
\v 10 If we say¦152997 that we haven't sinned, then we're making a liar out of Jesus and we haven't internalised his message¦153006.
\c 2
\s1 The messiah is our intermediary
\p
\v 1 I am writing to you all, my treasured new believers, so that you might avoid sinning. If anyone should sin, we have an intermediary between us and the father¦153028: Jesus the sinless messiah,
\v 2 and it's him who is the atonement for our sins—not just our sins, but also the sins of the entire world.
\p
\v 3 We will know if we \add really\add know Jesus if we obey his teachings.
\v 4 If someone says that they know Jesus but don't do what he taught, that person is a liar and hasn't internalised the truth¦153085.
\v 5 However the person who obeys Jesus' teaching demonstrates that God's love¦153101 has truly been planted in them. We know that we are \add alive\add* in Jesus if
\v 6 we claim to live in him¦153115 and then live our lives like he¦153112 lived.
\s1 Love not hate to be in the light
\p
\v 7 \x + \xo 2:7: \xt Jn 13:34.\x*Dear friends, I'm not writing¦153130 a new rule for you all, but \add reminding you\add* of an old rule that you had from the beginning. This old rule is the message¦153145 that you all heard.
\v 8 Then again I \em am\em* writing¦153153 a new rule to you—a rule which is true in Jesus and in you all, because the darkness¦153169 is already disappearing and the true light¦153173 is already shining¦153178.
\p
\v 9 The person who says they're in the light¦153183 but hates someone they know, is still in the darkness¦153195.
\v 10 It's the person that loves those around them who is living in the light¦153206 and¦153208 doesn't offend anyone.
\v 11 But the person who hates someone is living and walking in the darkness and doesn't know where they're going because they're blinded.
\s1 Don't love the things of this world
\p
\v 12 I'm writing¦153244 to you new believers because your sins¦153252 have been forgiven because of Jesus authority.
\v 13 I'm writing to you fathers¦153259 because you have known the messiah from the beginning.\x + \xo 2:13: \xt Lk 2: 25-35.\x*
\v 14 I wrote to you new believers because you have know the father¦153281. I wrote to you fathers¦153284 because you have known the messiah from the beginning.\x + \xo 2:13: \xt Lk 2: 25-35.\x* I wrote to you young men¦153293 because you are strong and God's message¦153299 lives in you and you have overcome the evil one.
\p
\v 15 Don't be loving the world nor the things¦153314 in the world. The father's love does not live in anyone who loves the world
\v 16 because everything that's in the world, bodily desires and lusts and arrogant living¦153351, is not from the father¦153356 but from the world.
\v 17 And the world will come to an end along with the desire for it¦153369, but¦153371 the person obeying God's desires will continue to live.
