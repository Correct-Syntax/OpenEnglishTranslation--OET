\mt2 The first letter
\mt2 that we have written by
\mt1 Yohan
\is1 Introduction
\ip This \bk First letter of Yohan\bk* had two purposes: 1.) encouraging the readers about God and his son Yeshua the messiah; and 2.) warning them that it's important to not follow false or incorrect teachings that can destroy their unity with the master. These false teachers stated that Yeshua didn't become a person like us. They also taught that salvation doesn't include godly living and the love of others.
\ip So in refuting those false doctrines, Yohan carefully explained that Yeshua the messiah came to this world as a real person, and he also explained that all who believe in Yeshua and love God, must also demonstrate their love to each other.

\s1 The message that is life
\rem /s1 The Word of Life
\rem /s1 Introduction
\p
\v 1-3 We are reporting to you and testifying about what existed from the beginning:\x + \xo 1:1: \xt Jn 1:1.\x*\bdit Yeshua the messiah and son of God\bdit*. We heard him, we saw him with our own eyes¦152763, and we touched¦152771 him with our own hands¦152769. Concerning the message¦152774 of life, we can also report and testify to you that that life was revealed\x + \xo 1:2: \xt Jn 1:14.\x*—\add he is\add* the eternal life that was with the father and was revealed to us. We report what we've seen and what we've heard so that you all also can have fellowship with us, and our fellowship is with the father and with his son.
\v 4 We're writing¦152838 all this so that our¦152844 joy¦152843 may be extended to you also.
\s1 We're all sinners
\rem /s1 Living in the Light
\rem /s1 Fellowship, obedience, and forgiveness
\rem /s1 God Is Light
\rem /s1 Walking in the light
\p
\v 5 This is the message¦152858 that we heard¦152860 from him and which¦152859 we are declaring¦152864 to you all: \nd God¦152869\nd* is light¦152870 and there is no darkness¦152873 in him—none at all.
\v 6 If we say¦152883 that we and him¦152888 are relating well together and yet we're walking¦152893 in the darkness¦152892, then we're lying¦152894 and not living the truth¦152900.
\v 7 \nd But¦152921\nd* if we're walking¦152906 in the light, just like he walks in the light, then we'll get along well with each other, and his¦152924 son \nd Yeshua's¦152920\nd* blood¦152919 is removing the consequences of all our sins.
\p
\v 8 If we say¦152931 that we don't¦152934 have any sin¦152933, then we're \add just\add* fooling ourselves¦152936 and haven't embraced the truth¦152941.
\v 9 \add But\add* if we admit our sins, Yeshua is trustworthy and totally sinless, and he will forgive¦152958 us for our sins and remove all of our guilt and consequences.
\v 10 If we say¦152971 that we haven't sinned¦152974, then we're making¦152976 a liar out of Yeshua and we haven't internalised his¦152981 message¦152980.
\c 2
\s1 The messiah is our advocate
\rem /s1 Christ Our Advocate
\rem /s1 Christ Our Helper
\p
\v 1 I am writing¦152989 to you all, my¦152987 treasured new believers, so that you might avoid sinning. If anyone¦152996 should sin, we have an advocate¦152998 \add to help us relate to\add* the father¦153002: \nd Yeshua¦153003\nd* the sinless \nd messiah¦153004\nd*,
\v 2 and it's him who is the atonement¦153008 for our sins—not just our sins, but also the sins of the entire¦153025 world¦153027.
\p
\v 3 We will know if we \add really\add* know Yeshua if we obey his¦153039 teachings.
\v 4 If someone says that they know Yeshua but don't¦153051 do what he taught, that person is a liar and hasn't internalised the truth¦153059.
\v 5 However the person who obeys Yeshua's teaching demonstrates that God's love¦153075 has truly¦153071 been planted in them. We know that we are \add alive\add* in Yeshua if
\v 6 we claim to live in him¦153089 and then live our lives like he lived.
\s1 Love not hate to be in the light
\rem /s1 A New Commandment
\rem /s1 The New Command
\p
\v 7 \x + \xo 2:7: \xt Jn 13:34.\x*Dear friends, I'm not writing¦153104 a new rule for you all, but \add reminding you\add* of an old rule that you had from the beginning¦153112. This old rule is the message¦153119 that you all heard¦153121.
\v 8 Then again I \em am\em* writing¦153127 a new rule to you—a rule which¦153129 is true in Yeshua and in you all, because¦153140 the darkness¦153143 is already disappearing and the true light¦153147 is already shining¦153152.
\p
\v 9 Anyone who says they're in the light¦153157 but hates a fellow believer,\f + \fr 2:9 \ft Literally ‘our brothers’. In this letter that term could refer to ‘siblings’, ‘fellow believers’, or ‘fellow citizens’ (or Yohan could be alternating between two or three of them in his mind as he wrote). After considering all the uses of the term in chapters 2–5, we have taken ‘fellow believers’ as being more likely, i.e., the context would often seem to be focussing on believers (even though most of us would want to apply 3:16–17 to also include ‘fellow citizens’).\f* is still in the darkness¦153169.
\v 10 It's the person that loves their fellow believers who is living in the light¦153180 and¦153182 doesn't offend¦153183 anyone.
\v 11 But the person who hates a fellow believer is living and walking¦153204 in the darkness and doesn't know where¦153208 they're going¦153209 because¦153210 they're blinded¦153213.
\s1 Don't love the things of this world
\p
\v 12 I'm writing¦153218 to you new believers because your sins¦153226 have been forgiven¦153222 because of Yeshua authority.
\v 13 I'm writing to you fathers¦153233 because you have known¦153235 the messiah from the beginning¦153238.\x + \xo 2:13: \xt Lk 2: 25-35.\x*
\v 14 I wrote to you new believers because you have know the father¦153255. I wrote to you fathers¦153258 because you have known the messiah from the beginning¦153265.\x + \xo 2:13: \xt Lk 2: 25-35.\x* I wrote to you young¦153267 men¦153267 because you are strong¦153269 and God's message¦153273 lives in you and you have overcome¦153280 the evil one.
\rem /s1 Do Not Love the World
\p
\v 15 Don't be loving the world nor the things¦153288 in the world. The father's¦153303 love does not live in anyone¦153293 who loves the world
\v 16 because everything that's in the world, bodily desires and lusts and arrogant¦153323 living¦153325, is not from the father¦153330 but from the world.
\v 17 And the world¦153338 will come to an end along with the desire for it¦153343, but¦153345 the person obeying God's desires will continue to live.

\p
\v 18 New believers, it's now the last times and what you¦153364 heard¦153364 about the false messiah coming¦153368 is now happening. Many false messiahs have already been around and that confirms that it's now the last times.
\v 19 They came¦153383 from our¦153388 group, but they were never truly part of us because¦153391 if they were, they would have stayed with us. But they left¦153383 us so it would be revealed¦153402 that they're not part of us.
\p
\v 20 But you all have received the spirit\f + \fr 2:20 \ft anointing: It's not really clear here what Yohan is referring to that they have received: God's favour? a skill or ability? a blessing? the Holy Spirit? But v27 below seems to be talking about God's holy spirit.\f* from the chosen messiah\f + \fr 2:20 \ft holy (one): Yohan seems to be referring to Yeshua here.\f* and you all know all about it.\f + \fr 2:20 \ft You all know all: also unclear what Yohan means.\f*
\v 21 I didn't write to you all because you don't¦153420 know the truth, but because you have known the truth and any falsehood¦153435 is not part of it.
\p
\v 22 Anyone who teaches that \nd Yeshua¦153450\nd* is not the messiah is a liar. And anyone who disowns the father¦153464 and¦153465 the son is a false messiah.
\v 23 Anyone who disowns¦153470 the son, doesn't know the father either—only those who confess¦153478 the son know the father
\p
\v 24 What you all heard from the beginning, that's what you should hold to. If the message that you heard from the beginning remains in you, then you also will remain in the son and in the father¦153514,
\v 25 and in that case, what he promised¦153523 us is to live forever.
\p
\v 26 I wrote¦153533 these¦153531 things¦153531 to you all concerning¦153535 those who would mislead¦153537 you.
\v 27 But for you, the spirit that you received¦153545 from Yeshua remains in you all and so you don't¦153554 need anyone¦153558 else to teach you because his¦153566 spirit teaches you about everything. The spirit teaches truth and not lies, and since you were taught¦153584 by the spirit then you are remaining in Yeshua.
\rem /s1 Children of God
\p
\v 28 So now you new believers, remain¦153593 in him so that when he is revealed¦153599, we can have boldness¦153602 and not be ashamed¦153605 of him when he comes \add back\add*.
\rem /s1 Children of God
\v 29 Because you know that he is sinless, you also know that anyone faithfully obeying his¦153628 teaching has been \add re\add*born in him.

\p
\v 1 \x + \xo 3:1: \xt Jn 1:12.\x*Consider the amazing live that the father¦153640 has given¦153635 to us in order¦153641 that we can be called¦153644 God's children¦153642, and indeed we are.
\v 2 Dear friends we are God's children¦153661 now, but it's not yet revealed what we will become. We know that when Yeshua is revealed, we will be similar¦153674 to him because¦153677 then we'll be seeing¦153678 him exactly as he is.
\v 3 Everyone who trusts their future to him¦153690 needs to purify¦153691 themself just like he is pure.
\p
\v 4 Everyone¦153697 who regularly sins is demonstrating lawlessness, and sin is lawlessness.
\v 5 \x + \xo 3:5: \xt Jn 1:29.\x*You all know that Yeshua was revealed¦153718 in order¦153719 to take¦153723 away sins¦153721, and¦153724 there's no sin¦153725 in him¦153727.
\v 6 Everyone¦153732 who remains¦153736 in him doesn't sin—everyone¦153739 who keeps sinning has neither¦153742 really seen¦153743 Yeshua nor known¦153746 him.
\p
\v 7 So new believers, don't let anyone deceive¦153753 you: the person faithfully obeying Yeshua's teaching will be declared not guilty just as he is not guilty.
\v 8 Anyone who regularly sins belongs to the devil, because¦153774 the devil has been sinning¦153779 from the beginning¦153776.
\p
\v 9 Everyone¦153793 who's been \add re\add*born in God, doesn't regularly sin because God's seed \add of life\add* remains¦153807 in them and that person isn't able to sin because they have been \add re\add*born in God.
\v 10 You can distinguish God's children and the devil's¦153829 children like this: everyone¦153831 who doesn't faithfully obey Yeshua's teaching or doesn't love their fellow believers, that person doesn't belong to God.
\s1 Demonstrate your love for each other
\rem /s1 Love one another
\rem /s1 Love One Another
\p
\v 11 \x + \xo 3:11: \xt Jn 13:34.\x*Yes, this is the message¦153854 that you¦153856 all heard¦153856 from the beginning¦153858: to be loving¦153860 each other—
\v 12 not living like Cain who belonged to the evil one and went on to murder his brother.\x + \xo 3:12: \xt Gen 4:8.\x* And why did he kill him? Because¦153879 his own actions were evil, but his brother \add Abel\add* followed God's instructions.
\p
\v 13 And friends, don't be surprised if the world¦153900 hates you¦153898.
\v 14 \x + \xo 3:14: \xt Jn 5:24.\x*We know that we have transferred from death to life because¦153912 we are loving our fellow¦153915 believers¦153915. Anyone who doesn't love others is stuck in death.
\v 15 Everyone¦153926 who hates another person is a murderer, and¦153935 you¦153936 all know that murderers don't¦153940 have eternal¦153943 life¦153942 in them.
\v 16 We know about \add real\add* love¦153952 because¦153953 we saw that Yeshua gave up his¦153959 life¦153958 for us, and we should give up our lives¦153968 for our fellow¦153966 believers¦153966.
\v 17 But anyone who's enjoying being alive and notices that a fellow believer is in need yet shuts that other believer's needs out of their conscience, how can God's love¦153995 be living¦153976 in that person?
\v 18 So you new believers, don't¦154003 just proclaim that you're loving¦154004 people, but¦154010 actually demonstrate it in actions and¦154013 in fact.
\rem /s1 Courage before God
\v 19 That's how we'll know that the truth¦154023 really is in us.
\p At the same time, we need to tell ourselves
\v 20 that if we are feeling condemned¦154038, \nd God¦154048\nd* is greater¦154044 than our¦154040 feelings and he knows everything.
\v 21 Then dear friends, if we're not feeling condemned¦154065, we have confidence¦154069 in \nd God¦154074\nd*
\v 22 and confidence that whatever¦154076 we are requesting¦154079 from him, we will receive¦154081 it because¦154086 we are following his¦154089 instructions and doing the things¦154094 that please¦154094 him.
\v 23 \x + \xo 3:23: \xt Jn 13:34; 15:12,17.\x*And this is his command: We need to believe¦154106 in the authority of his son, Yeshua the \nd messiah¦154113\nd*, and we should love each other as per the command that Yeshua gave¦154119 to us.
\v 24 Anyone who follows his¦154127 commands¦154126 is living in him, and he is living in them and we have confirmation that he is living in us, because we have the \nd spirit¦154145\nd* that he gave¦154148 to us.

\v 1 Dear friends, don't¦154153 trust every¦154154 spirit¦154155, but¦154158 test them to determine whether¦154162 or not it's from \nd God¦154165\nd*, because¦154167 many false¦154169 prophets¦154169 go around the world¦154173.
\v 2 You all can find out whether or not a spirit is from God: If the spirit confesses¦154191 that \nd Yeshua¦154193\nd* the \nd messiah¦154194\nd* has come as a person, then it's from God
\v 3 but if the spirit won't confess¦154208 \nd Yeshua¦154210\nd*, then it's not from \nd God¦154218\nd* but rather it's the spirit of the false messiah, whom you've heard¦154229 is coming¦154232, and is now already¦154239 in the world¦154237.
\p
\v 4 You new believers are in \nd God¦154243\nd* and you have defeated the \add false prophets\add*, because¦154249 the one in you is more powerful than the one in the world¦154259.
\v 5 They belong to the world hence they¦154270 are speaking¦154270 from the world, and¦154271 the world is listening to them.
\v 6 However we belong to God, and anyone who knows God listens to us, but anyone who doesn't belong to God can't accept what we're saying. That's how we can distinguish the spirit of truth¦154304 from deceptive¦154309 spirits.

\v 7 Dear friends, we need to be loving each other, because¦154313 love is from God and everyone¦154321 who \add truly\add* loves has been \add re\add*born into God and knows God.
\v 8 Those who don't love, don't love God because¦154343 God is love.
\v 9 God's love¦154352 was revealed¦154350 to us when he sent¦154363 his¦154360 only son to be born into the world¦154368 so that we can live¦154370 through¦154372 him.
\v 10 So this is \add real\add* love¦154378, not us loving God, but¦154389 God loving us and¦154395 sending his¦154400 son to be the sacrifice to clear us of the sentence from our¦154405 sins¦154404.
\p
\v 11 Dear friends, if \nd God¦154410\nd* loves us like that, we¦154414 ought¦154415 to be loving¦154417 each other.
\v 12 \x + \xo 4:12: \xt Jn 1:18.\x*No one has ever seen¦154421 God, but when we¦154425 are loving¦154425 each other then God is living in us, and¦154432 his¦154435 love¦154434 is being perfected¦154436 in us.
\p
\v 13 We can know that we are living in him and him in us because¦154453 he has given¦154458 to us from his¦154457 \nd spirit¦154456\nd*.
\v 14 And we¦154462 have seen¦154463 and¦154465 are testifying¦154466 that the father¦154469 sent¦154470 the son—the saviour¦154473 of the world¦154475.
\v 15 Anyone who confesses¦154479 that \nd Yeshua¦154482\nd* is God's son, God lives in that person and¦154494 they live in God.
\v 16 We have known¦154503 and experienced the love that God has in us.
\p God is love, and anyone who lives in love, lives in God, and God lives in them.
\v 17 This is how love¦154540 will be perfected¦154538 in us so that we can live with confidence¦154546 about the \add coming\add* judgement day¦154551: we live like Yeshua in this world¦154565.
\v 18 There's no fear in love, but rather perfect love drives away fear, because¦154581 our fear is that of being punished¦154584 but the one fearing¦154588 has not been perfected in love.
\p
\v 19 We love others because¦154600 he¦154603 loved¦154605 us first¦154604.
\v 20 Anyone who says that they are loving God but hates a fellow believer, that person is liar because¦154622 if someone can't love a fellow believer that they've seen, they can't love God who they've never seen.
\v 21 So we¦154643 have this command¦154642 from Yeshua that anyone who loves \nd God¦154652\nd* must also love their fellow believers.

\v 7 because there are three¦154805 that testify¦154808:
\v 8 the \nd spirit¦154835\nd*, the water¦154838, and the blood¦154841, and these three¦154844 come together into one.
\v 9 If we accept testimonies from people, then God's testimony is better, because¦154863 God's testimony is about his¦154876 son.
\v 10 Any person that believes that \add Yeshua is\add* God's son has internalised God's testimony, but anyone who doesn't believe in God calls him a liar because¦154901 they have not believed the testimony of God himself¦154890 about his¦154915 son.

\v 17 All disobedience is sin, but there¦155081 are sins that don't¦155083 \add necessarily\add* lead to death¦155085.
\p
\v 18 We know that everyone¦155088 who's been \add re\add*born into God doesn't keep sinning¦155095, but¦155096 the \add messiah\add* who was born from God watches over them and¦155105 so the evil¦155107 one can't touch¦155109 them.
\p
\v 19 We know that we¦155116 belong to \nd God¦155115\nd* and¦155117 that the whole¦155120 word is under the control of the evil¦155123 one.
\p
\v 20 We know that God's son has come and helped our minds so that we could know the true one, and we are in the true one and \add also\add* in his¦155155 son, \nd Yeshua¦155156\nd* the \nd messiah¦155158\nd*—the true God and eternal¦155168 life¦155167 \add itself\add*.
\p
\v 21 You new believers, don't honour idols¦155175.
