\s1 The six days of creation
\rem /s1 Six Days of Creation and the Sabbath; The Account of Creation; The Beginning; The Story of Creation; The creation of the universe
\p
\v 1 In the beginning, God\f + \fr 1:1 \ft As per common practice, we use ‘God’ through the Hebrew scriptures for the word ‘elohim’. Note that ‘elohim’ is a Hebrew language plural, and is translated more literally as ‘gods’ in a few places. However the connected Hebrew verb translated ‘created’ here is clearly a singular form, so the singular noun ‘God’ fits better here and everywhere where ‘elohim’ is used with other verbs marked as being singular. The mysterious plurality of God is confirmed in v26 where ‘our’ is used to refer to him/them.\f* created the heavens and the earth.
\v 2 The earth was formless and empty and darkness covered the surface of the depth \add waters\add* and God's spirit was hovering over the surface of the waters.
\v 3 Then God said, “Let there be light,” and light came into existence,\x + \xo 1:3: \xt 2Cor 4:6.\x*
\v 4 and God observed that the light was good. Then he separated the light from the darkness.
\v 5 God named the light \em daytime\em*, and the darkness he named \em nighttime\em*. Then evening came, and \add later\add* morning came, \add and that was the end of the\add* first day.
\p
\v 6 Then God said, “Let there be a large space in the middle of the waters, and let it separate the two lots of waters.”\x + \xo 1:6-8: \xt 2Pe 3:5.\x*
\v 7 So God made the large space and separated between the waters that were underneath from the waters that were above it. Everything happened \add exactly\add* as he commanded,
\v 8 and he named the space \em sky\em*. Then evening came, and \add later\add* morning came, \add and that was the end of\add* the second day.
\p
\v 9 Then God said, “Let the waters under the sky be gathered to one place, and let the dry ground appear.” Everything happened \add exactly\add* as he commanded,
\v 10 and he named the ground that appeared \em land\em*, and he named the gathered waters \add seas\add*, and he saw that \add what he had done\add* was good.
\v 11 Then God said, “Let the land sprout vegetation: every plant yielding seed, every fruit tree bearing its own fruit that has its seed inside it, on the earth.” Everything happened \add exactly\add* as he commanded,
\v 12 so the land started producing vegetation, every plant producing its own seed, and every tree bearing fruit that has its seed inside it. And God saw that \add what he had done\add* was good.
\v 13 Then evening came, and \add later\add* morning came, \add and that was the end of\add* the third day.
\p
\v 14 Then God said, “Let there be lights in the sky to separate daytime from nighttime, so they'll be signs, and for \add indicating\add* seasons, and for \add tracking\add* days and years.
\v 15 They must function as lights in the sky that shine \add light\add* on the earth.” Everything happened \add exactly\add* as he commanded,
\v 16 so God made the two large lights, the larger, brighter light to rule the day, and the smaller light to rule the night, and he \add also\add* made the stars.
\v 17 He put those lights in the sky to shine \add light\add* on the earth,
\v 18 and to oversee the daytime and the nighttime, and to distinguish between the light and the darkness. And God saw that \add what he had done\add* was good.
\v 19 Then evening came, and \add later\add* morning came, \add and that was the end of\add* the fourth day.
\p
\v 20 Then God said, “Let the waters be full of with swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly in the sky above the earth.”
\v 21 So God created the great sea creatures and every kind of living creature that moves which the waters swarm with, and every kind of winged bird. And God saw that \add what he had done\add* was good,
\v 22 and he blessed them, saying, “Be fruitful and multiply and fill the waters in the seas, and let the birds multiply on the earth.”
\v 23 Then evening came, and \add later\add* morning came, \add and that was the end of\add* the fifth day.
\p
\v 24 Then God said, “Let the land bring forth every kind of living creature: livestock and every crawling creature and every kind of living thing on the earth.” Everything happened \add exactly\add* as he commanded,
\v 25 so he made every kind of creature of the earth, and every kind of livestock, and every kind of crawling creature on the ground. And God saw that \add what he had done\add* was good.
\p
\v 26 Then God said, “Let us make man in our image, according to our likeness, and let them rule over the fish in the sea and over the birds in the sky and over the livestock and over all the earth, and over every creature moving on the earth.”\x + \xo 1:26: \xt 1Cor 11:7.\x*
\v 27 Then God created humankind in his image, \add yes,\add* created in the image of God—male and female he created them.\x + \xo 1:27-28: \xt Gen 5:1-2.\x*
\v 28 Then God blessed them and told them, “Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and take control of it. You're in charge of the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky and over every living thing that moves on the earth.”
\v 29 Then God said, “Look, I've given you every plant throughout the whole earth that yields seed, and every tree that has fruit with a seed or seeds inside it. They will be yours for food,
\v 30 and to every living thing on the earth, and to every bird in the sky, and to everything moving on the earth that has living breath in it, I've given every green plant for food.” Everything happened \add exactly\add* as he commanded,
\v 31 and he saw everything that he'd made, and wow, it was \em very\em* good. Then evening came, and \add later\add* morning came, \add and that was the end of\add* the sixth day.
\c 2
\p
\v 1 So the heavens and the earth were completed, along with everything in them.
\v 2 By the seventh day God had finished his work, so he rested on the seventh day from all his work that he'd done.\x + \xo 2:2-3: \xt Exo 20:11.\x*
\v 3 Then God blessed the seventh day and declared it to be different from the other days, because on that \add first Saturday\add*, he rested from all his work of creating.

\p
\v 4 What follows tells\f + \fr 2:4 \ft This little formula is sometimes known as a ‘toledoth’ (or ‘tōlədōt’, from the Hebrew word) and seems to mark a new section, but it's debated whether this part belongs at the bottom of the previous section, or at the top of the following section. We're assuming the later here.\f* \add more details about\add* the history of what God did when he created the heavens and the earth: 
\rem /s1 The Garden of Eden; The Man and Woman in Eden; Another Account of the Creation
\p During the time when Yahweh God\f + \fr 2:4 \ft This is the first occurrence of the Hebrew letters ‘יהוה’ (YHWH) in the Bible, which we find out later (in Exodus 3, also compiled by Moses) is God's actual name. Although the vowels which go with those four consonants have been lost over the millenia, most scholars believe ‘Yahweh’ to be the best guess that we can make. (It's certainly NOT ‘Jehovah’, which was a historical mistake made by confusing the vowels of two different words.) Some older translations use \sc LORD\sc* which is NOT a translation of ‘יהוה’ (which means ‘I am’), but which represents confusion over the more recent Jewish (but non-Biblical) custom of not pronouncing God's name (and which makes one wonder what's the use of telling people your name if they're then not allowed to use it).\f* made the earth and the heavens,
\v 5 there weren't yet any bushes growing on the earth, and no plants had yet sprung up in the fields, because Yahweh God had not yet made it rain, and nor were there any people yet to till the ground.
\v 6 However, a mist came up from the ground and watered the entire surface of the land.
\p
\v 7 Then Yahweh God formed the \add first\add* man out of the dust on the ground and he breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living person.\x + \xo 2:7: \xt 1Cor 15:45.\x*
\p
\v 8 Now in the east, Yahweh God had planted a garden in Eden, and he put the man there that he had formed.
\v 9 He \add also\add* caused all kinds of trees to grow there—\add some\add* that are pleasant to look at and good for food. In the middle of the garden was the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil\x + \xo 2:9: \xt Rev 2:7; 22:2,14.\x*
\p
\v 10 A river flowed out of Eden to water the garden, and then from there it split into four rivers.
\v 11 The first river was named Pishon, and it winds around through the entire region of Havilah, where there's gold.
\v 12 The gold from there is \add very pure\add*, and there's also \add a type of fragrant resin\add* and onyx \add gemstones\add* there.
\v 13 The second river was named Gihon, and it winds through the entire region of Cush.
\v 14 The third river was named Tigris, and it flowed east of the Asshur \add region\add*, and then the fourth river was \add named\add* Frat.
\p
\v 15 Yahweh God took the man and put him in the garden at Eden to cultivate and maintain it
\v 16 and instructed him, “You can eat as much \add fruit\add* as you want from any tree in the garden,
\v 17 but you mustn't eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, because the day you eat its \add fruit\add* you'll certainly die.”
\p
\v 18 Then Yahweh God said, “It's not good for the man to be alone, so I'll make a suitable helper for him.”
\p
\v 19 Now Yahweh God had formed every living thing of the field and every bird of the sky from the ground, so he brought them to the man to see what he would call them, and whatever the man called each living creature, that would become its name.
\v 20 The man gave names to all the \add various\add* livestock and to the birds of the sky and to every living creature in the fields, but none of them was a suitable \add companion\add* to help him.
\p
\v 21 So Yahweh God caused the man to go into a deep sleep, and then while he was sleeping, he removed one of his ribs and closed up \add over\add* its place with flesh.
\v 22 Then Yahweh God used the rib which he had taken from the man to form into a woman, and he brought her to the man,
\v 23 and the man said:
\q1 “Now this is bone from my bones
\q2 and flesh from my flesh.
\q1 She'll be named ‘woman’
\q2 because she came from a man.”
\m
\v 24 So that's why a man leaves his father and mother, and becomes united to his wife, and the two of them become one being.\x + \xo 2:24: \xt Mat 19:5; Mrk 10:7-8; 1Cor 6:16; Eph 5:31.\x*
\p
\v 25 At that time, both the man and his wife were naked, but they had no sense of shame.

\s1 The couple disobey God
\rem /s1 The Fall of Man; Human Disobedience; The Man and Woman Sin; The First Sin and Its Punishment
\p
\v 1 Now the snake was the craftiest of all the animals that Yahweh God had created, and \add one day\add* he asked the woman, “Did God really command you to not eat \add fruit\add* from any of the trees in the garden?”\x + \xo 3:1: \xt Rev 12:9; 20:2.\x*
\p
\v 2 “No,” answered the woman, “we can eat the fruit from \add any\add* of the trees in the garden,
\v 3 except from the tree that is in the centre. He commanded \add us\add* to not eat that fruit or even touch it, because if we do, we will die!”
\p
\v 4 But the serpent said to the woman, “It's not definite that you'll die.
\v 5 Actually, God knows that as soon as you eat fruit from that tree, you'll understand new things, so that you will know \add what's\add* right and \add what's\add* wrong just like God does.”
\p
\v 6 The woman saw that the tree's \add fruit looked\add* good to eat and that the tree itself was very atractive, plus she wanted \add to eat\add* the fruit so that it would make her wise. So she picked some of the fruit and ate it and she also gave \add some of it\add* to her husband \add who was there\add* with her, and he ate it \add too\add*.
\v 7 \add Immediately\add* they both had new understanding and they felt their nakedness. So they sewed \add some\add* fig leaves together and made skirts for themselves.
\p
\v 8 \add Late that afternoon,\add* during the cool time of the day, the man and his wife heard Yahweh God's voice as he walked in the garden, but they hid from him behind some trees in the garden,
\v 9 so Yahweh God called out to the man, “\add Adam,\add* where are you?”
\p
\v 10 “I heard you \add walking\add* in the garden,” he replied, “but I was scared because I was naked, so I hid \add myself\add*.”
\p
\v 11 “Who told you that you're naked?” Yahweh God asked. “Have you eaten \add the fruit\add* that I told you not to eat?”
\p
\v 12 “The woman that you put here beside me,” answered the man, “she gave me \add some\add* fruit from the tree and I ate it.”
\p
\v 13 Then Yahweh God asked the woman, “What did you do?”\x + \xo 3:13: \xt 2Cor 11:3; 1Tim 2:14.\x*
\p “The snake tricked me, so I ate \add some of the fruit\add*,” the woman replied.
\s1 God's judgements after they disobeyed
\rem /s1 God Pronounces Judgment
\p
\v 14 Then Yahweh God said to the snake,
\q1 “Because you've done this you'll be cursed more than all the livestock,
\q2 and more than every living thing in the fields.
\q1 \add Now\add* you'll move along on your belly,
\q2 and you'll eat dust all the rest of your life.
\q1
\v 15 I'll put hostility between you and the woman
\q2 between your descendants and hers.
\q1 He will crush your head
\q2 and you'll strike his heel.”\x + \xo 3:15: \xt Rev 12:17.\x*
\p
\v 16 To the woman God said,
\q1 “I'll sharply increase your pain in childbirth.
\q2 You'll produce children in pain.
\q1 Your desire will be for your husband
\q2 and he will rule over you.”
\p
\v 17 Then \add God\add* said to the man,\x + \xo 3:17-18: \xt Heb 6:8.\x*
\q1 “Because you did what your wife told you
\q2 and ate from that tree
\q2 that I'd told you not to eat from,
\q1 then the ground will be cursed because of you.
\q1 You'll have to work hard to get food from it
\q2 all the rest of your life.
\q1
\v 18 It'll produce thorns and thistles for you
\q2 although you'll eat the crops of the fields.
\q1
\v 19 You'll eat bread with sweat drops on your nose
\q2 until you return to the ground
\q2 because you were taken out of the ground.
\q1 \add Yes,\add* you were \add created\add* from dust,
\q2 and you'll return back to dust.”
\p
\v 20 Then the man named his wife ‘Havvah’ \add (which means ‘living’)\add* because she would become the mother of all future people.
\v 21 Then Yahweh God made clothes from \add animal\add* skins for Adam and his wife and he dressed them.
\s1 The humans get expelled from the garden

\p
\v 22 Then Yahweh God said, “See, the man has become like one of us, being aware of good and evil. But now, he mustn't \add be allowed\add* to reach out his hand and also take \add fruit\add* from the tree of life and eat it and live forever.”\x + \xo 3:22: \xt Rev 22:14.\x*
\v 23 So Yahweh God expelled \add them\add* out of the garden in Eden to work the soil from which \add Adam\add* had been taken.
\p
\v 24 After he expelled them, he placed sentries on the east side of the garden in Eden, as well as a fiery sword that swung around in every direction to guard the path to the tree of life.

\rem /s1 Cain Murders Abel; Cain, Abel, and Seth; Cain and Abel
\p
\v 1 Then Adam slept with his wife, and she conceived and \add in due course \add* gave birth to Kayin (Cain). “Yahweh has enabled me to produce a man,” she said.
\v 2 \add Eventually\add* she also gave birth to Kayin's brother, Abel. Abel became a shepherd, while Kayin became a crop farmer.
\v 3 Some \add months\add* later, Kayin brought some of what he'd grown in the ground as an offering to Yahweh,
\v 4 and also Abel brought the best portions from some of the firstborn of his flock. Now Yahweh was pleased with Abel and his offering,\x + \xo 4:4: \xt Heb 11:4.\x*
\v 5 but he didn't even look towards Kayin and his offering. Kayin got very angry and his face showed his displeasure.
\v 6 Then Yahweh said to Kayin, “Why are you so angry? And why are you frowning like that?
\v 7 If you do what's right, won't you be honoured? But if you don't do what's right, sin is crouching in the doorway wanting to have you, but you have the control over it.”
\p
\v 8 \add One day,\add* Kayin spoke to his brother Abel when they were \add out\add* in the field, and then Kayin attacked him and killed him.\x + \xo 4:8: \xt Mat 23:35; Luk 11:51; 1Jn 3:12.\x*
\p
\v 9 \add Later\add* Yahweh asked Kayin, “Where's your brother Abel?”
\p “I don't know,” he replied, “It's not my job to look after my brother.”
\p
\v 10 “What have you done?” Yahweh asked. “Your brother's blood is calling out to me from the ground.\x + \xo 4:10: \xt Heb 12:24.\x*
\v 11 So now you're cursed and banished from the soil that your brother's blood soaked into as a result of your actions.
\v 12 Whenever you till \add and plant\add* the ground, it will no longer produce good yields for you. You'll be a fugitive and wandering \add refugee\add* on the earth.”
\p
\v 13 “My punishment is more than I can bear,” Kayin \add complained\add* to Yahweh.
\v 14 “Look, you're now driving me \add away\add* from the ground \add I've been cultivating\add* to somewhere where you won't be able to see me. I'll be a wandering \add refugee\add* on the earth, and anyone who finds me will kill me.”
\p
\v 15 “Very well,”, replied Yahweh and declared, “If anyone kills Kayin, then that person will receive a seven times greater \add sentence\add*.” Then Yahweh marked Kayin so that no one who found him would kill him,
\v 16 and Kayin left Yahweh's presence and settled in the land of Nod to the east of Eden.

\p
\v 17 Then Kayin slept with his wife and and she conceived and gave birth to Hanoch (Enoch). Then Kayin founded a town and named it Hanoch after his son.
\v 18 \add Eventually\add* Hanoch fathered Irad, and Irad fathered Mehuyael, and Mehuyael father Methushael, and Methushael fathered Lemech (Lamech).
\v 19 Lemech had two wives: the first was named Adah and the second was Tsillah (Zillah).
\v 20 Adah gave birth to Yaval (Jabal) who became the ancestor of people who live in tents and rear cattle.
\v 21 His brother's name was Yuval (Jubal) and he became the ancestor of people who play stringed and wind instruments.
\v 22 Tsillah gave birth to Tuval-Kayin (Tubal-Cain) who forged all \add kinds of\add* tools out of bronze and iron. His sister was \add named\add* Naamah.
\v 23 Then Lemech said to his wives:
\q1 “Adah and Tsillah, listen to me.
\q2 My wives, take notice of my words;
\q1 I killed a man who had wounded me;
\q2 I killed a young man who hurt me.
\q1

\p
\v 25 Then Adam slept with his wife again and she bore a son and named him Shet (Seth) \add (which means ‘given’)\add* because she had said, “God has given me another son in place of Abel who was killed by Kayin.”
\v 26 \add Eventually\add* Shet also fathered a son and named him Enosh. That was when people began using Yahweh's name in worship.

\v 1 When people began to multiply on the earth's surface, and they were having daughters,\x + \xo 6:1-4: \xt Yob 1:6; 2:1.\x*
\v 2 God's sons saw that men's daughters were beautiful, and they took any that they wanted for themselves as wives.
\v 3 Then Yahweh said, “My Spirit won't tolerate people forever, because they are physical beings, therefore their \add remaining\add* time will be 120 years.”
\v 4 The NEFILIM were on the earth in those days and also after that, when the sons of God went to the daughters of mankind and they bore children for them. INVESTIGATE They were the mighty \add warriors\add* of long ago—those famous men.\x + \xo 6:4: \xt Num 13:33.\x*
\p
\v 5 Then Yahweh saw that the humankind's wickedness on the earth was extensive, and that every inclination of their inner thoughts was only evil all day long.\x + \xo 6:5-8: \xt Mat 24:37; Luk 17:26; 1Pe 3:20.\x*
\v 6 So Yahweh regretted that he had made humankind on the earth and he was deeply saddened,
\v 7 so he said, “This humankind that I created, I will completely destroy them from the surface of the ground, along with the animals, and crawling creatures and the birds of the sky, because I regret that I made them.”
\v 8 However, Yahweh noticed Noak (Noah) and was pleased with him.
\s1 Noak makes a barge
\rem /s1 Noah; Noah Pleases God
\p
\v 9 This is the account of Noak: He was a man who obeyed God, blameless among the people of his time and he walked around with God.\x + \xo 6:9: \xt 2Pe 2:5.\x*
\v 10 Noak had three sons: Shem, Ham, and Yafet (Japheth).
\p
\v 11 Now God noticed that \add humankind\add* was corrupt and very violent.
\v 12 \add Yes,\add* God looked at the earth, and wow, all the living creatures on the earth had corrupted their behaviour.
\p
\v 13 So God told Noak, “I've decided to put an end to all people on earth because the earth is filled with violence because of them. So listen, I myself am going to destroy all of them, along with the earth.
\v 14 Make yourself a wooden chest\f + \fr 6:14 \ft The reader might have expected the word ‘ark’ here, but sadly the Latin word ‘arca’ meaning ‘large box, chest’ led to the English word ‘ark’ being invented, and why we can't use it here, is that now for most English readers, they picture a large boat in their minds when they hear that word. If you think about the ‘ark of the covenant’ that uses the same word, hopefully you can understand how anything like a ‘boat’ is the wrong word picture, hence we've gone back to translating the actual Hebrew word here.\f* out of cypress. Build rooms inside it, and seal it both inside and outside with resin.
\v 15 These are the dimensions for it: 140m long, 23m wide, and 14m high.
\v 16 It must have a roof, but the last half a metre between the sides and the roof should remain open. Put the door in its side, and build lower, middle, and upper decks.
\v 17 You see, I'm going to flood the earth with water to destroy every creature that breathes. Everything that's on the earth will die.
\v 18 \add But\add* I'll make an agreement with you, so you must go into this chest along with your wife and sons and their wives,
\v 19 and you must take a pair, male and female, of everything that lives into the chest to keep alive with you.
\v 20 Pairs of every kind of bird and animal, including every kind of creature that moves on the ground, will come to you so that you keep them alive,
\v 21 and you must take with you some of every different kind of food and store it in there for you and them to eat.
\v 22 So Noak did \add that\add* exactly as God had specified.\x + \xo 6:22: \xt Heb 11:7.\x*

\s1 The global flood
\rem /s1 The Flood Covers the Earth; The Flood; The Great Flood
\p
\v 1 Then Yahweh said to Noak, “Go into the ark, you and all your household, because I've seen that you're the \add only\add* one who obeys me in this generation.
\v 2 Take in seven male and female pairs of every kind of ‘clean’ animal, and one male and female pair of the ‘unclean’ animals,
\v 3 as well as seven male and female pairs of every kind of flying bird \add in order\add* to preserve their kinds on the earth.
\v 4 Seven days from now I'll send forty days and nights of rain on the earth, and I'll eliminate every living thing that I've made that's \add still\add* on the ground.
\v 5 So Noak did everything that Yahweh had instructed him to do.
\p
\v 6 Noak was 600 years old when the flood covered the earth,
\v 7 and he went into the \add wooden\add* chest along with his wife, his \add three\add* sons and their wives, \add in order\add* to escape from the floodwaters.\x + \xo 7:7: \xt Mat 24:38-39; Luk 17:27.\x*
\v 8 ‘Clean’ and ‘unclean’ animals, the birds, and everything that lived on the ground
\v 9 came to Noak in male and female pairs and went into the chest, just like God had instructed Noak.
\v 10 Then when the seven days were up, water \add started\add* to flood the earth.
\p
\v 11 When Noak was 600 years old (and around the beginning of May), deep underwater geysers in the ocean started spouting out water, and the skies began to drop heavy rain\x + \xo 7:11: \xt 2Pe 3:6.\x*
\v 12 that continued day and night for forty days.
\v 13 That was the very day that Noak and Shem and Ham and Yafet and their wives had all entered the \add wooden\add* chest.
\v 14 They had with them every kind of living creature, including every kind of livestock and every \add other\add* kind of creature that lives on the land, and every kind of bird \add and\add* everything \add else\add* that flies.
\v 15 They had come to Noak \add in order\add* to enter the chest—two by two of every creature with the breath of life.
\v 16 So \add pairs of\add* males and females of every creature entered just as God had instructed \add Noak\add*, then Yahweh \add closed the door and\add* they were shut in.
\p
\v 17 Then the flood came onto the earth for forty days, and the water rose so that the \add wooden\add* chest was lifted up right off the land.
\v 18 The water continued to rise and get deeper on the earth, and the chest floated along on top of the water.
\v 19 \add Eventually\add* the water on the earth got so deep that all the high mountains everywhere under the sky were under water—
\v 20 \add in fact\add* the water rose over seven metres above the tops of them.
\v 21 \add By\add* then every living creature that lived on the earth had drowned—birds, livestock, animals, every creature that swarms upon the earth, and all humankind.
\v 22 Everything that \add had\add* the breath of the spirit of life in its nostrils, everything that \add lived\add* on dry land, died.
\v 23 That's how \add Yahweh\add* completely annihilated every living creature off the earth, including humankind and livestock and crawling creatures and \add even\add* the birds. Everything was annihilated except for Noak and those with him in the \add floating\add* chest,
\v 24 and the earth remained in full flood for 150 days.

\s1 Waiting for the land to dry
\rem /s1 The End of the Flood; The Flood Recedes; The Flood Subsides
\p
\v 1 Then God considered Noak and and all the living things and all the livestock that were with him in the \add floating\add* chest, and he caused a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters \add started to\add* subside
\v 2 and the underwater geysers and the rain was stopped.
\v 3 Then the water steadily receded from the earth and after five months the water had gone down \add enough\add*
\v 4 that by October the \add wooden\add* chest was left sitting on one of the Ararat mountains.
\v 5 The water continued to recede until December when the tops of the mountains became visible.
\p
\v 6 Then after another forty days, Noak opened a window near the \add top\add* of the chest
\v 7 and he released a raven which kept flying out and returning until the land started to dry out.
\v 8 Then Noak \add also\add* released a dove to see if the land was really out of the water,
\v 9 but the dove didn't find anywhere to land so it returned to the window because the surface of the earth was still wet, and he stretched out his arm and brought the dove back inside.
\v 10 Noak waited another week and then he released the dove again
\v 11 and it returned to him in the evening and wow, it had a fresh, green olive leaf in its beak. So now Noak knew that the land was out of the water.
\v 12 Then he waited another week, and released the dove \add again\add*, but this time it didn't come back to him.
\p
\v 13 So it was when Noak was 601 years old (in the month of WHAT MONTH on the first day of the \add Jewish\add* new year) the land was still drying out. So Noak made an opening in the top of the \add wooden\add* chest and saw that the land surface \add there\add* was \add almost\add* dry.
\v 14 By the end of the next month, the land was fully dry.
\p
\v 15 Then God said to Noak,
\v 16 “Leave the \add wooden\add* chest along with your sons and each of your wives.
\v 17 Take out all the living creatures that are with you, including the birds and livestock, and everything that crawls (CHECK FOR WORD CONSISTENCY) on the ground, so that they'll proliferate and increase their numbers \add all\add* over the earth.
\v 18 So Noak went outside, along with his sons and each of their wives.
\v 19 Every living creature, every crawling thing and every bird, everything moving on the earth, went outside kind by kind.

\p
\v 22 Yosef continued to live in Egypt, along with \add the rest of\add* his father Yacob's family, until he was 110 years old.
\v 23 He lived long enough to see his son Ephraim's children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren. The children of his grandson Machir, who was Manasseh's son, also grew up around him.
\v 24 Then \add one day\add* Yosef said to his brothers, “I'm about to die, but God will definitely help you all and take you \add and your descendants\add* from this country to the land that he vowed to give to Abraham, Isaac, and Yacob.
\v 25 When God does that, you must take my body \add back to Canaan with you and bury it there\add*.” Then Yosef had \add his brothers and the rest of the descendants of Israel\add* vow \add that they would do that\add*.\x + \xo 50:25: \xt Exo 13:19; Josh 24:32; Heb 11:22.\x*
\v 26 Then Yosef died at the age of 110, and \add the specialists\add* embalmed \add his body\add* and it was put in a coffin in \add a tomb in\add* Egypt.
