\s1 The six days of creation
\rem /s1 Six Days of Creation and the Sabbath; The Account of Creation; The Beginning; The Story of Creation; The creation of the universe
\p
\v 1 In the beginning, God\f + \fr 1:1 \ft As per common practice, we use ‘God’ through the Hebrew scriptures for the word ‘elohim’. Note that ‘elohim’ is a Hebrew language plural, and is translated more literally as ‘gods’ in a few places. However the connected Hebrew verb translated ‘created’ here is clearly a singular form, so the singular noun ‘God’ fits better here and everywhere where ‘elohim’ is used with other verbs marked as being singular. The mysterious plurality of God is confirmed in v26 where ‘our’ is used to refer to him/them.\f* created the heavens and the earth.
\v 2 The earth was formless and empty and darkness covered the surface of the depth \add waters\add* and God's spirit was hovering over the surface of the waters.
\v 3 Then God said, “Let there be light,” and light came into existence,\x + \xo 1:3: \xt 2Cor 4:6.\x*
\v 4 and God observed that the light was good. Then he separated the light from the darkness.
\v 5 God named the light \em daytime\em*, and the darkness he named \em nighttime\em*. Then evening came, and \add later\add* morning came, \add and that was the end of the\add* first day.
\p
\v 6 Then God said, “Let there be a large space in the middle of the waters, and let it separate the two lots of waters.”\x + \xo 1:6-8: \xt 2Pe 3:5.\x*
\v 7 So God made the large space and separated between the waters that were underneath from the waters that were above it. Everything happened \add exactly\add* as he commanded,
\v 8 and he named the space \em sky\em*. Then evening came, and \add later\add* morning came, \add and that was the end of\add* the second day.
\p
\v 9 Then God said, “Let the waters under the sky be gathered to one place, and let the dry ground appear.” Everything happened \add exactly\add* as he commanded,
\v 10 and he named the ground that appeared \em land\em*, and he named the gathered waters \add seas\add*, and he saw that \add what he had done\add* was good.
\v 11 Then God said, “Let the land sprout vegetation: every plant yielding seed, every fruit tree bearing its own fruit that has its seed inside it, on the earth.” Everything happened \add exactly\add* as he commanded,
\v 12 so the land started producing vegetation, every plant producing its own seed, and every tree bearing fruit that has its seed inside it. And God saw that \add what he had done\add* was good.
\v 13 Then evening came, and \add later\add* morning came, \add and that was the end of\add* the third day.
\p
\v 14 Then God said, “Let there be lights in the sky to separate daytime from nighttime, so they'll be signs, and for \add indicating\add* seasons, and for \add tracking\add* days and years.
\v 15 They must function as lights in the sky that shine \add light\add* on the earth.” Everything happened \add exactly\add* as he commanded,
\v 16 so God made the two large lights, the larger, brighter light to rule the day, and the smaller light to rule the night, and he \add also\add* made the stars.
\v 17 He put those lights in the sky to shine \add light\add* on the earth,
\v 18 and to oversee the daytime and the nighttime, and to distinguish between the light and the darkness. And God saw that \add what he had done\add* was good.
\v 19 Then evening came, and \add later\add* morning came, \add and that was the end of\add* the fourth day.
\p
\v 20 Then God said, “Let the waters be full of with swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly in the sky above the earth.”
\v 21 So God created the great sea creatures and every kind of living creature that moves which the waters swarm with, and every kind of winged bird. And God saw that \add what he had done\add* was good,
\v 22 and he blessed them, saying, “Be fruitful and multiply and fill the waters in the seas, and let the birds multiply on the earth.”
\v 23 Then evening came, and \add later\add* morning came, \add and that was the end of\add* the fifth day.
\p
\v 24 Then God said, “Let the land bring forth every kind of living creature: livestock and every crawling creature and every kind of living thing on the earth.” Everything happened \add exactly\add* as he commanded,
\v 25 so he made every kind of creature of the earth, and every kind of livestock, and every kind of crawling creature on the ground. And God saw that \add what he had done\add* was good.
\p
\v 26 Then God said, “Let us make man in our image, according to our likeness, and let them rule over the fish in the sea and over the birds in the sky and over the livestock and over all the earth, and over every creature moving on the earth.”\x + \xo 1:26: \xt 1Cor 11:7.\x*
\v 27 Then God created humankind in his image, \add yes,\add* created in the image of God—male and female he created them.\x + \xo 1:27-28: \xt Gen 5:1-2.\x*
\v 28 Then God blessed them and told them, “Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and take control of it. You're in charge of the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky and over every living thing that moves on the earth.”
\v 29 Then God said, “Look, I've given you every plant throughout the whole earth that yields seed, and every tree that has fruit with a seed or seeds inside it. They will be yours for food,
\v 30 and to every living thing on the earth, and to every bird in the sky, and to everything moving on the earth that has living breath in it, I've given every green plant for food.” Everything happened \add exactly\add* as he commanded,
\v 31 and he saw everything that he'd made, and wow, it was \em very\em* good. Then evening came, and \add later\add* morning came, \add and that was the end of\add* the sixth day.
\c 2
\p
\v 1 So the heavens and the earth were completed, along with everything in them.
\v 2 By the seventh day God had finished his work, so he rested on the seventh day from all his work that he'd done.\x + \xo 2:2-3: \xt Exo 20:11.\x*
\v 3 Then God blessed the seventh day and declared it to be different from the other days, because on that \add first Saturday\add*, he rested from all his work of creating.

\p
\v 4 What follows tells\f + \fr 2:4 \ft This little formula is sometimes known as a ‘toledoth’ (or ‘tōlədōt’, from the Hebrew word) and seems to mark a new section, but it's debated whether this part belongs at the bottom of the previous section, or at the top of the following section. We're assuming the later here.\f* \add more details about\add* the history of what God did when he created the heavens and the earth: 
\rem /s1 The Garden of Eden; The Man and Woman in Eden; Another Account of the Creation
\p During the time when Yahweh God\f + \fr 2:4 \ft This is the first occurrence of the Hebrew letters ‘יהוה’ (YHWH) in the Bible, which we find out later (in Exodus 3, also compiled by Moses) is God's actual name. Although the vowels which go with those four consonants have been lost over the millenia, most scholars believe ‘Yahweh’ to be the best guess that we can make. (It's certainly NOT ‘Jehovah’, which was a historical mistake made by confusing the vowels of two different words.) Some older translations use \sc LORD\sc* which is NOT a translation of ‘יהוה’ (which means ‘I am’), but which represents confusion over the more recent Jewish (but non-Biblical) custom of not pronouncing God's name (and which makes one wonder what's the use of telling people your name if they're then not allowed to use it).\f* made the earth and the heavens,
\v 5 there weren't yet any bushes growing on the earth, and no plants had yet sprung up in the fields, because Yahweh God had not yet made it rain, and nor were there any people yet to till the ground.
\v 6 However, a mist came up from the ground and watered the entire surface of the land.
\p
\v 7 Then Yahweh God formed the \add first\add* man out of the dust on the ground and he breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living person.\x + \xo 2:7: \xt 1Cor 15:45.\x*
\p
\v 8 Now in the east, Yahweh God had planted a garden in Eden, and he put the man there that he had formed.
\v 9 He \add also\add* caused all kinds of trees to grow there—\add some\add* that are pleasant to look at and good for food. In the middle of the garden was the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil\x + \xo 2:9: \xt Rev 2:7; 22:2,14.\x*
\p
\v 10 A river flowed out of Eden to water the garden, and then from there it split into four rivers.
\v 11 The first river was named Pishon, and it winds around through the entire region of Havilah, where there's gold.
\v 12 The gold from there is \add very pure\add*, and there's also \add a type of fragrant resin\add* and onyx \add gemstones\add* there.
\v 13 The second river was named Gihon, and it winds through the entire region of Cush.
\v 14 The third river was named Tigris, and it flowed east of the Asshur \add region\add*, and then the fourth river was \add named\add* Frat.
\p
\v 15 Yahweh God took the man and put him in the garden at Eden to cultivate and maintain it
\v 16 and instructed him, “You can eat as much \add fruit\add* as you want from any tree in the garden,
\v 17 but you mustn't eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, because the day you eat its \add fruit\add* you'll certainly die.”
\p
\v 18 Then Yahweh God said, “It's not good for the man to be alone, so I'll make a suitable helper for him.”
\p
\v 19 Now Yahweh God had formed every living thing of the field and every bird of the sky from the ground, so he brought them to the man to see what he would call them, and whatever the man called each living creature, that would become its name.
\v 20 The man gave names to all the \add various\add* livestock and to the birds of the sky and to every living creature in the fields, but none of them was a suitable \add companion\add* to help him.
\p
\v 21 So Yahweh God caused the man to go into a deep sleep, and then while he was sleeping, he removed one of his ribs and closed up \add over\add* its place with flesh.
\v 22 Then Yahweh God used the rib which he had taken from the man to form into a woman, and he brought her to the man,
\v 23 and the man said:
\q1 “Now this is bone from my bones
\q2 and flesh from my flesh.
\q1 She'll be named ‘woman’
\q2 because she came from a man.”
\m
\v 24 So that's why a man leaves his father and mother, and becomes united to his wife, and the two of them become one being.\x + \xo 2:24: \xt Mat 19:5; Mrk 10:7-8; 1Cor 6:16; Eph 5:31.\x*
\p
\v 25 At that time, both the man and his wife were naked, but they had no sense of shame.

\s1 The couple disobey God
\rem /s1 The Fall of Man; Human Disobedience; The Man and Woman Sin; The First Sin and Its Punishment
\p
\v 1 Now the snake was the craftiest of all the animals that Yahweh God had created, and \add one day\add* he asked the woman, “Did God really command you to not eat \add fruit\add* from any of the trees in the garden?”\x + \xo 3:1: \xt Rev 12:9; 20:2.\x*
\p
\v 2 “No,” answered the woman, “we can eat the fruit from \add any\add* of the trees in the garden,
\v 3 except from the tree that is in the centre. He commanded \add us\add* to not eat that fruit or even touch it, because if we do, we will die!”
\p
\v 4 But the serpent said to the woman, “It's not definite that you'll die.
\v 5 Actually, God knows that as soon as you eat fruit from that tree, you'll understand new things, so that you will know \add what's\add* right and \add what's\add* wrong just like God does.”
\p
\v 6 The woman saw that the tree's \add fruit looked\add* good to eat and that the tree itself was very atractive, plus she wanted \add to eat\add* the fruit so that it would make her wise. So she picked some of the fruit and ate it and she also gave \add some of it\add* to her husband \add who was there\add* with her, and he ate it \add too\add*.
\v 7 \add Immediately\add* they both had new understanding and they felt their nakedness. So they sewed \add some\add* fig leaves together and made skirts for themselves.
\p
\v 8 \add Late that afternoon,\add* during the cool time of the day, the man and his wife heard Yahweh God's voice as he walked in the garden, but they hid from him behind some trees in the garden,
\v 9 so Yahweh God called out to the man, “\add Adam,\add* where are you?”
\p
\v 10 “I heard you \add walking\add* in the garden,” he replied, “but I was scared because I was naked, so I hid \add myself\add*.”
\p
\v 11 “Who told you that you're naked?” Yahweh God asked. “Have you eaten \add the fruit\add* that I told you not to eat?”
\p
\v 12 “The woman that you put here beside me,” answered the man, “she gave me \add some\add* fruit from the tree and I ate it.”
\p
\v 13 Then Yahweh God asked the woman, “What did you do?”\x + \xo 3:13: \xt 2Cor 11:3; 1Tim 2:14.\x*
\p “The snake tricked me, so I ate \add some of the fruit\add*,” the woman replied.
\s1 God's judgements after they disobeyed
\rem /s1 God Pronounces Judgment
\p
\v 14 Then Yahweh God said to the snake,
\q1 “Because you've done this you'll be cursed more than all the livestock,
\q2 and more than every living thing in the fields.
\q1 \add Now\add* you'll move along on your belly,
\q2 and you'll eat dust all the rest of your life.
\q1
\v 15 I'll put hostility between you and the woman
\q2 between your descendants and hers.
\q1 He will crush your head
\q2 and you'll strike his heel.”\x + \xo 3:15: \xt Rev 12:17.\x*
\p
\v 16 To the woman God said,
\q1 “I'll sharply increase your pain in childbirth.
\q2 You'll produce children in pain.
\q1 Your desire will be for your husband
\q2 and he will rule over you.”
\p
\v 17 Then \add God\add* said to the man,\x + \xo 3:17-18: \xt Heb 6:8.\x*
\q1 “Because you did what your wife told you
\q2 and ate from that tree
\q2 that I'd told you not to eat from,
\q1 then the ground will be cursed because of you.
\q1 You'll have to work hard to get food from it
\q2 all the rest of your life.
\q1
\v 18 It'll produce thorns and thistles for you
\q2 although you'll eat the crops of the fields.
\q1
\v 19 You'll eat bread with sweat drops on your nose
\q2 until you return to the ground
\q2 because you were taken out of the ground.
\q1 \add Yes,\add* you were \add created\add* from dust,
\q2 and you'll return back to dust.”
\p
\v 20 Then the man named his wife ‘Havvah’ \add (which means ‘living’)\add* because she would become the mother of all future people.
\v 21 Then Yahweh God made clothes from \add animal\add* skins for Adam and his wife and he dressed them.
\s1 The humans get expelled from the garden

\p
\v 22 Then Yahweh God said, “See, the man has become like one of us, being aware of good and evil. But now, he mustn't \add be allowed\add* to reach out his hand and also take \add fruit\add* from the tree of life and eat it and live forever.”\x + \xo 3:22: \xt Rev 22:14.\x*
\v 23 So Yahweh God expelled \add them\add* out of the garden in Eden to work the soil from which \add Adam\add* had been taken.
\p
\v 24 After he expelled them, he placed sentries on the east side of the garden in Eden, as well as a fiery sword that swung around in every direction to guard the path to the tree of life.

\p
\v 1 Then Adam slept with his wife, and she conceived and \add in due course \add* gave birth to Kayin (Cain). “Yahweh has enabled me to produce a man,” she said.
\v 2 \add Eventually\add* she also gave birth to Kayin's brother, Abel. Abel became a shepherd, while Kayin became a crop farmer.
\v 3 Some \add months\add* later, Kayin brought some of what he'd grown in the ground as an offering to Yahweh,
\v 4 and also Abel brought the best portions from some of the firstborn of his flock. Now Yahweh was pleased with Abel and his offering,\x + \xo 4:4: \xt Heb 11:4.\x*
\v 5 but he didn't even look towards Kayin and his offering. Kayin got very angry and his face showed his displeasure.
\v 6 Then Yahweh said to Kayin, “Why are you so angry? And why are you frowning like that?
\v 7 If you do what's right, won't you be honoured? But if you don't do what's right, sin is crouching in the doorway wanting to have you, but you have the control over it.”
\p
\v 8 \add One day,\add* Kayin spoke to his brother Abel when they were \add out\add* in the field, and then Kayin attacked him and killed him.\x + \xo 4:8: \xt Mat 23:35; Luk 11:51; 1Jn 3:12.\x*
\p
\v 9 \add Later\add* Yahweh asked Kayin, “Where's your brother Abel?”
\p “I don't know,” he replied, “It's not my job to look after my brother.”
\p
\v 10 “What have you done?” Yahweh asked. “Your brother's blood is calling out to me from the ground.\x + \xo 4:10: \xt Heb 12:24.\x*
\v 11 So now you're cursed and banished from the soil that your brother's blood soaked into as a result of your actions.
\v 12 Whenever you till \add and plant\add* the ground, it will no longer produce good yields for you. You'll be a fugitive and wandering \add refugee\add* on the earth.”
\p
\v 13 “My punishment is more than I can bear,” Kayin \add complained\add* to Yahweh.
\v 14 “Look, you're now driving me \add away\add* from the ground \add I've been cultivating\add* to somewhere where you won't be able to see me. I'll be a wandering \add refugee\add* on the earth, and anyone who finds me will kill me.”
\p
\v 15 “Very well,”, replied Yahweh and declared, “If anyone kills Kayin, then that person will receive a seven times greater \add sentence\add*.” Then Yahweh marked Kayin so that no one who found him would kill him,
\v 16 and Kayin left Yahweh's presence and settled in the land of Nod to the east of Eden.

\p
\v 17 Then Kayin slept with his wife and and she conceived and gave birth to Hanoch (Enoch). Then Kayin founded a town and named it Hanoch after his son.
\v 18 \add Eventually\add* Hanoch fathered Irad, and Irad fathered Mehuyael, and Mehuyael father Methushael, and Methushael fathered Lemech (Lamech).
\v 19 Lemech had two wives: the first was named Adah and the second was Tsillah (Zillah).
\v 20 Adah gave birth to Yaval (Jabal) who became the ancestor of people who live in tents and rear cattle.
\v 21 His brother's name was Yuval (Jubal) and he became the ancestor of people who play stringed and wind instruments.
\v 22 Tsillah gave birth to Tuval-Kayin (Tubal-Cain) who forged all \add kinds of\add* tools out of bronze and iron. His sister was \add named\add* Naamah.
\v 23 Then Lemech said to his wives:
\q1 “Adah and Tsillah, listen to me.
\q2 My wives, take notice of my words;
\q1 I killed a man who had wounded me;
\q2 I killed a young man who hurt me.

\p
\v 25 Then Adam slept with his wife again and she bore a son and named him Shet (Seth) \add (which means ‘given’)\add* because she had said, “God has given me another son in place of Abel who was killed by Kayin.”

\rem /s1 Noah and the Flood; Human Wickedness; The Wickedness of Humankind; The Flood; The flood and the tower of Babel
\p
\v 1 When people began to multiply on the earth's surface, and they were having daughters,\x + \xo 6:1-4: \xt Yob 1:6; 2:1.\x*
\v 2 God's sons saw that men's daughters were beautiful, and they took any that they wanted for themselves as wives.
\v 3 Then Yahweh said, “My Spirit won't tolerate people forever, because they are physical beings, therefore their \add remaining\add* time will be 120 years.”
\v 4 The NEFILIM were on the earth in those days and also after that, when the sons of God went to the daughters of mankind and they bore children for them. INVESTIGATE They were the mighty \add warriors\add* of long ago—those famous men.\x + \xo 6:4: \xt Num 13:33.\x*
\p
\v 5 Then Yahweh saw that the humankind's wickedness on the earth was extensive, and that every inclination of their inner thoughts was only evil all day long.\x + \xo 6:5-8: \xt Mat 24:37; Luk 17:26; 1Pe 3:20.\x*
\v 6 So Yahweh regretted that he had made humankind on the earth and he was deeply saddened,
\v 7 so he said, “This humankind that I created, I will completely destroy them from the surface of the ground, along with the animals, and crawling creatures and the birds of the sky, because I regret that I made them.”
\v 8 However, Yahweh noticed Noah and was pleased with him.
\s1 Noah makes a barge
\rem /s1 Noah; Noah Pleases God
\p
\v 9 This is the account of Noah: He was a man who obeyed God, blameless among the people of his time and he walked around with God.\x + \xo 6:9: \xt 2Pe 2:5.\x*
\v 10 Noah had three sons: Yafet (Japheth), Shem, and Ham.
\p
\v 11 Now God noticed that \add humankind\add* was corrupt and very violent.
\v 12 \add Yes,\add* God looked at the earth, and wow, all the living creatures on the earth had corrupted their behaviour.
\p
\v 13 So God told Noah, “I've decided to put an end to all people on earth because the earth is filled with violence because of them. So listen, I myself am going to destroy all of them, along with the earth.
\v 14 Make yourself a wooden chest\f + \fr 6:14 \ft The reader might have expected the word ‘ark’ here, but sadly the Latin word ‘arca’ meaning ‘large box, chest’ led to the English word ‘ark’ being invented, and why we can't use it here, is that now for most English readers, they picture a large boat in their minds when they hear that word. If you think about the ‘ark of the covenant’ that uses the same word, hopefully you can understand how anything like a ‘boat’ is the wrong word picture, hence we've gone back to translating the actual Hebrew word here.\f* out of cypress. Build rooms inside it, and seal it both inside and outside with resin.
\v 15 These are the dimensions for it: 140m long, 23m wide, and 14m high.
\v 16 It must have a roof, but the last half a metre between the sides and the roof should remain open. Put the door in its side, and build lower, middle, and upper decks.
\v 17 You see, I'm going to flood the earth with water to destroy every creature that breathes. Everything that's on the earth will die.
\v 18 \add But\add* I'll make an agreement with you, so you must go into this chest along with your wife and sons and their wives,
\v 19 and you must take a pair, male and female, of everything that lives into the chest to keep alive with you.
\v 20 Pairs of every kind of bird and animal, including every kind of creature that moves on the ground, will come to you so that you keep them alive,
\v 21 and you must take with you some of every different kind of food and store it in there for you and them to eat.
\v 22 So Noah did \add that\add* exactly as God had specified.\x + \xo 6:22: \xt Heb 11:7.\x*

\s1 The global flood
\rem /s1 The Flood Covers the Earth; The Flood; The Great Flood
\p
\v 1 Then Yahweh said to Noah, “Go into the ark, you and all your household, because I've seen that you're the \add only\add* one who obeys me in this generation.
\v 2 Take in seven male and female pairs of every kind of ‘clean’ animal, and one male and female pair of the ‘unclean’ animals,
\v 3 as well as seven male and female pairs of every kind of flying bird \add in order\add* to preserve their kinds on the earth.
\v 4 Seven days from now I'll send forty days and nights of rain on the earth, and I'll eliminate every living thing that I've made that's \add still\add* on the ground.
\v 5 So Noah did everything that Yahweh had instructed him to do.
\p
\v 6 Noah was 600 years old when the flood covered the earth,
\v 7 and he went into the \add wooden\add* chest along with his wife, his \add three\add* sons and their wives, \add in order\add* to escape from the floodwaters.\x + \xo 7:7: \xt Mat 24:38-39; Luk 17:27.\x*
\v 8 ‘Clean’ and ‘unclean’ animals, the birds, and everything that lived on the ground
\v 9 came to Noah in male and female pairs and went into the chest, just like God had instructed Noah.
\v 10 Then when the seven days were up, water \add started\add* to flood the earth.
\p
\v 11 When Noah was 600 years old (and around the beginning of May), deep underwater geysers in the ocean started spouting out water, and the skies began to drop heavy rain\x + \xo 7:11: \xt 2Pe 3:6.\x*
\v 12 that continued day and night for forty days.
\v 13 That was the very day that Noah and Yafet and Shem and Ham and their wives had all entered the \add wooden\add* chest.
\v 14 They had with them every kind of living creature, including every kind of livestock and every \add other\add* kind of creature that lives on the land, and every kind of bird \add and\add* everything \add else\add* that flies.
\v 15 They had come to Noah \add in order\add* to enter the chest—two by two of every creature with the breath of life.
\v 16 So \add pairs of\add* males and females of every creature entered just as God had instructed \add Noah\add*, then Yahweh \add closed the door and\add* they were shut in.
\p
\v 17 Then the flood came onto the earth for forty days, and the water rose so that the \add wooden\add* chest was lifted up right off the land.
\v 18 The water continued to rise and get deeper on the earth, and the chest floated along on top of the water.
\v 19 \add Eventually\add* the water on the earth got so deep that all the high mountains everywhere under the sky were under water—
\v 20 \add in fact\add* the water rose over seven metres above the tops of them.
\v 21 \add By\add* then every living creature that lived on the earth had drowned—birds, livestock, animals, every creature that swarms upon the earth, and all humankind.
\v 22 Everything that \add had\add* the breath of the spirit of life in its nostrils, everything that \add lived\add* on dry land, died.
\v 23 That's how \add Yahweh\add* completely annihilated every living creature off the earth, including humankind and livestock and crawling creatures and \add even\add* the birds. Everything was annihilated except for Noah and those with him in the \add floating\add* chest,
\v 24 and the earth remained in full flood for 150 days.

\s1 Waiting for the land to dry
\rem /s1 The End of the Flood; The Flood Recedes; The Flood Subsides
\p
\v 1 Then God considered Noah and and all the living things and all the livestock that were with him in the \add floating\add* chest, and he caused a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters \add started to\add* subside
\v 2 and the underwater geysers and the rain was stopped.
\v 3 Then the water steadily receded from the earth and after five months the water had gone down \add enough\add*
\v 4 that by October the \add wooden\add* chest was left sitting on one of the Ararat mountains.
\v 5 The water continued to recede until December when the tops of the mountains became visible.
\p
\v 6 Then after another forty days, Noah opened a window near the \add top\add* of the chest
\v 7 and he released a raven which kept flying out and returning until the land started to dry out.
\v 8 Then Noah \add also\add* released a dove to see if the land was really out of the water,
\v 9 but the dove didn't find anywhere to land so it returned to the window because the surface of the earth was still wet, and he stretched out his arm and brought the dove back inside.
\v 10 Noah waited another week and then he released the dove again
\v 11 and it returned to him in the evening and wow, it had a fresh, green olive leaf in its beak. So now Noah knew that the land was out of the water.
\v 12 Then he waited another week, and released the dove \add again\add*, but this time it didn't come back to him.
\p
\v 13 So it was when Noah was 601 years old (in the month of WHAT MONTH on the first day of the \add Jewish\add* new year) the land was still drying out. So Noah made an opening in the top of the \add wooden\add* chest and saw that the land surface \add there\add* was \add almost\add* dry.
\v 14 By the end of the next month, the land was fully dry.
\p
\v 15 Then God said to Noah,
\v 16 “Leave the \add wooden\add* chest along with your sons and each of your wives.
\v 17 Take out all the living creatures that are with you, including the birds and livestock, and everything that crawls (CHECK FOR WORD CONSISTENCY) on the ground, so that they'll proliferate and increase their numbers \add all\add* over the earth.
\v 18 So Noah went outside, along with his sons and each of their wives.
\v 19 Every living creature, every crawling thing and every bird, everything moving on the earth, went outside kind by kind.
\s1 Noah's sacrifice and Yahweh's promise
\rem /s1 Noah Offers a Sacrifice; God's Promise to Noah
\p
\v 20 Then Noah built an altar to Yahweh, and he took \add some\add* of every kind of clean animal and every kind of clean bird, and he offered \add them as\add* burnt offerings on the altar.
\v 21 \add When\add* Yahweh smelt the pleasant aroma, he said \add to himself\add*, “I'll never curse the ground because of mankind again, even though the humankind's hearts are inclined from their youth \add to do\add* evil \add things\add*. And I'll never again \add destroy\add* every living thing again like I've \add just\add* done.

\v 22 As long as the earth \add continues to\add* exist,

\s1 God's agreement with Noah
\rem /s1 God's Covenant With Noah; The Covenant with Noah
\p
\v 1 Then God blessed Noah and his sons and said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth.\x + \xo 9:1: \xt Gen 1:28.\x*
\v 2 \add Now\add* every living creature on the earth will be afraid and terrified of you, including every bird \add that flies\add* in the sky, along with every creature that moves on land, and all the fish in the ocean. I have put them \add all\add* under your authority.
\v 3 \add From now on\add* every creature that is alive and moves can be eaten as food—just like I \add previously\add* provided you green plants for food, now I provide you everything \add for food\add*—
\v 4 the only exception is meat with it's life blood \add still\add* in it.\x + \xo 9:4: \xt Lev 7:26-27; 17:10-14; 19:26; Deu 12:16,23; 15:23.\x*
\v 5 Also, I will certainly require blood as payment for people's lives: if anyone murders another person, I require that the murderer must die, and even if an animal kills a human being, I require that it must die.
\v 6 \add Yes,\add* if anyone sheds human blood, the others must shed the murderer's blood, because God made human beings in his image.\x + \xo 9:6: \xt Exo 20:13; Gen 1:26.\x*
\v 7 \add So then,\add* be fruitful and multiply—have children on the earth and become numerous.\x + \xo 9:7: \xt Gen 1:28.\x*
\p
\v 8 Then God said to Noah and his sons,
\v 9 “Now listen, I am making an agreement with you and your future descendants,
\v 10 and \add it's also\add* with every living creature that is with you: with the birds, the livestock, and every living thing on the earth with you, from all that came out of the \add wooden\add* chest to every \add future\add* living thing on the earth.
\v 11 My agreement that I'm establishing with you is that all living things will never die from a flood again. \add That's right,\add* I will never \add use\add* a flood again to destroy everything on the earth.”
\v 12 Then God added, “This is how I'll show everyone that I've made this agreement with you and with all the living creatures that are with you, along with all future generations:
\v 13 I'll place my rainbow among the clouds, and it'll be a sign of the agreement between me and \add all life\add* on the earth.
\v 14 So whenever I cause clouds to form \add in the sky\add* and a rainbow is visible in the clouds,
\v 15 then I'll remember my agreement that's between me and you and every kind of living creature, and a flood will never again destroy everything living.
\v 16 So whenever a rainbow appears among the clouds, I'll see it and remember my permanent agreement with every living creature that lives \add and will live\add* on the earth.”
\v 17 Then God said to Noah, “\add The rainbow\add* is the sign of the agreement that I have established between me and every living thing on the earth.”

\p
\v 18 Noah's sons who came out of the \add wooden\add* chest \add after the flood\add* were Yafet (Japheth), Shem, and Ham. (Ham became Canaan's father).
\v 19 They were Noah's three sons and from them the whole earth became populated.
\p
\v 20 \add After a while,\add* Noah, who was a farmer, planted \add some grape\add* vines,
\v 21 and \add in due course\add* he drank some of \add his\add* wine and got drunk, and he \add fell asleep\add* naked in his tent.
\v 22 Then Ham (Canaan's father) saw his father's nakedness then went outside and told his brothers \add what he'd seen\add*.
\v 23 So Shem and Yafet took a robe, and holding it between their shoulders they walked backwards into the tent and covered their father's nakedness. (Their faces were towards the tent entrance, so they didn't see his nakedness.)
\v 24 \add Eventually,\add* Noah woke up from his drunken sleep and found out what his youngest son (Ham) had done to him
\v 25 and said, “May Canaan be cursed and become a slave of slaves to his brothers!”
\v 26 Then he added, “Praise Yahweh who's Shem's God. May Canaan become Shem's slave.
\v 27 May God expand Yafet's territory and may he live in Shem's tents. May Canaan also become a slave of Yafet.”
\p
\v 28 After the flood, Noah lived another 350 years,
\v 29 and so he was 950 years old when he died.

\p
\v 1 Now the whole world had a single language and the same words,
\v 2 and as they migrated from the east, they discovered a plain in the Shinar region and settled there.
\v 3 Then they said to each other, “Come on, let's make bricks and cure them with fire.” So they had bricks instead of stones, and they had tar for mortar.
\p
\v 4 Then they said, “Come on, let's build a city for ourselves and a tower with its top in the sky, and let's make a reputation for ourselves, so that we don't get scattered all over the whole earth.”
\v 5 Then Yahweh came down to see the city and the tower that the humans were building
\v 6 and he said, “Look, they're \add just\add* one people group, and they all speak the same language. This is only the beginning of what they can do \add together\add*—soon they'll be capable of doing anything they plan to do.
\v 7 Come on then, let's go down and confuse their language so that they won't be able to understand each other's words.”
\v 8 So then they stopped building the city and Yahweh caused them to scatter over the whole world.
\v 9 That's why they named the city ‘Babel’ \add (meaning ‘mixed-up’)\add* because it was there that Yahweh mixed up everyone's language and then scattered them over the whole world.

\v 1 After those events, Yahweh spoke to Abram in a vision, telling him, “Don't be afraid, Abram, because I'll protect you and I'll generously and richly reward you.”
\p
\v 2 “My Lord Yahweh,” replied Abram, “what will you give me, since we have no children and it's Eliezer (\add my chief slave\add* from Damascus) who'll inherit all my possesions?”

\p
\v 8 “My master Yahweh,” Abram asked, “how will I know that I will possess it?”
\p
\v 9 “Bring me a three-year-old heifer,” Yahweh replied, “and a three-year-old she-goat and a three-year-old ram and a turtledove and a young pigeon.”

\p
\v 1 Now Abram's wife Sarai hadn't been able to give him any children, but she had an Egyptian servant named Hagar,
\v 2 so Sarai said to Abram, “Listen, Yahweh has prevented me from having children so please sleep with my servant. Perhaps I can have a family through her.” Abram agreed to what Sarai had suggested.
\v 3 So Sarai, the wife of Abram, took Hagar, her Egyptian servant, after Abram had lived ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to Abram her husband as a wife for him.
\v 4 So he slept with Hagar and she got pregnant, but once she realised that she began to despise her mistress.

\v 11 Then the messenger told her,
\q1 “Listen here: you're pregnant and will give birth to a son,
\q1 and you'll name him ‘Ishma'el’ (\add which means ‘God hears’)\add*
\q2 because Yahweh has heard your cries of misery.

\p
\v 17 Abraham fell to his knees and he laughed and said to himself, “How can a hundred year old man father a child? And what about Sarah who's ninety-nine years old having a baby!”

\v 15 At dawn the next day, the \add two\add* messengers urged Lot, saying, “Get up, take your wife and your two daughters who're here, so that all of you won't be swept away in the punishment of the city.”
\v 16 When Lot hesitated, because of Yahweh's mercy for him, the men grabbed his hand and his wife's hand and the hands of their daughters, and led them out beyond the edge of the city.\x + \xo 19:16: \xt 2Pe 2:7.\x*
\v 17 At that point \add one of them\add* told Lot, “Flee for your lives! Don't \add turn around and\add* look behind you and don't stop anywhere \add down\add* in the plain. Escape \add up to\add* the hills so you don't get swept away!”
\p
\v 18 \add But\add* Lot \add argued\add*, “Not right now, my masters.
\v 19 Listen, you've been kind to me and show us mercy by saving my life, but I won't be able to make it to the hills because the disaster will overtake me and I'll die.
\v 20 Listen, there's a small town nearby that I could flee to. Let me escape there. It's only small. Then my life would be saved.”
\p
\v 21 “Ok then,” the man replied, “I'll also grant your request about this so I won't overthrow the town that you're talking about.
\v 22 Hurry up, escape there, because I am not able to do a thing until you go there.”
\p That's why they \add renamed\add* the town to ‘Zoar’ \add (which means ‘small’)\add*.

\p
\v 23 The sun had already risen by the time Lot \add and family\add* reached Zoar.
\v 24 Then Yahweh rained burning sulfur down onto Sodom and Gomorrah,\x + \xo 19:24-25: \xt Mat 10:15; 11:23-24; Luk 10:12; 17:29; 2Pe 2:6; Yud 7.\x*
\v 25 and he destroyed those cities and all their inhabitants as well, as all of the plain including all the vegetation.
\v 26 \add But\add* Lot's wife who was following him looked back and she turned into a pillar of salt.\x + \xo 19:26: \xt Luk 17:32.\x*
\p
\v 27 \add Meanwhile,\add* Abraham got up early in the morning and went to the place where he had stood before Yahweh,

\v 29 So it was that when God destroyed the cities of the plain, he remembered Abraham and had Lot removed out of the middle of the destruction when he destroyed the cities that Lot had been living in.

\p
\v 30 Then Lot and his two daughters left Zoar and settled up in the hills, because he was afraid to stay in Zoar. So he lived in a cave \add up there\add* with his two daughters.
\v 31 Then the older girl said to the younger, “Dad's old and there isn't a \add single\add* man \add up here\add* to \add marry\add* us like happens to \add other women\add* in the world..
\v 32 So let's get Dad drunk and then we can lie with him, so that at least we can have some descendants through our father.”
\v 33 So then, they got their father to drink wine that evening, and the oldest daughter went and lay with her father, but he wasn't aware of her coming or going.
\p
\v 34 Then the next day, the older girl said to the younger, Listen, last night I lay with my father. Let's get him drunk again tonight then you go lie with him so that we'll give life to descendants through our father.”
\v 35 So that next evening also, they got their father to drink wine and the younger girl went and lay with him, but \add again\add* he wasn't aware of her coming or going.
\v 36 In that way, both of Lot's daughters got themselves pregnant through their father.
\v 37 Then the eldest daughter gave birth to a son and she named him Moab \add (which means ‘from my father’)\add*. (He's the ancestor of the Moabites to this day.)
\v 38 The younger daughter also gave birth to a son and she named him Ben-Ammi \add (which means ‘son of my people’)\add*. (He's the ancestor of Ammonites to this day.)

\rem /s1 Abraham Deceives Abimelech; Abraham and Abimelech; Abraham and Sarah at Gerar
\p
\v 1 Then Abraham traveled from there to the Negev region and he settled between Kadesh and Shur, staying in Gerar for a while.
\v 2 Abraham had told \add people\add* his wife Sarah was his sister, so Abimelech the king of Gerar sent for Sarah and took her.\x + \xo 20:2: \xt Gen 12:13; 26:7.\x*
\v 3 \add But\add* God came to Abimelech in a dream in the night and told him, “Listen, you're \add as good as\add* dead because of that woman you took because she is married to a husband.”
\p
\v 4 Now Abimelech hadn't gone near to her, so he said, “My master, would you destroy a nation even though it's innocent?
\v 5 Didn't Abraham himself tell me that she was his sister? And she herself also said that he was her brother. I did this with a \add clear conscience\add* and with \add clean\add* hands.”
\p
\v 6 Then God said to him in the dream, “Yes, I know that you did this with a \add clear conscience\add* and indeed I kept you from sinning against me. I didn't allow you to touch her for that reason.
\v 7 So now, return that man's wife because he's a prophet, and he'll pray for you and you'll live. But if you don't return her, be certain that you and all your people will surely die.”
\p
\v 8 So \add King\add* Abimelech got up early in the morning and called for all of his servants \add to come\add*, and he explained the entire situation to them and they were very scared.
\v 9 Then he sent for Abraham and asked him, “What have you done to us? What did I do to you that you would cause all this trouble for me and my people? What you did to me should never have happened.”
\v 10 Then he asked again, “What were you thinking when you did that?”
\p
\v 11 “Because I thought that there's probably no one around here who \add obeys\add* God,” replied Abraham “so they might kill me because of my wife.
\v 12 \add Besides that,\add* Sarah actually \em is\em* my \add half-\add*sister. We have the same father, but different mothers, and then it was her that I took as a wife.
\v 13 \add Later\add* when God got me to leave my father's home, I said to her, ‘You could do this one kindness do for me: Everywhere we go, just tell them that he's your brother.’ ”
\p
\v 14 Then \add King\add* Abimelech returned Sarah his wife to him and also gave him flocks and herds, and male and female slaves,
\v 15 and he told him, “Look, my land is in front of you. Settle wherever looks good to you.”
\v 16 Then he said to Sarah, “Listen, I've given 1,000 pieces of silver to your brother. That's for you to demonstrate that you did nothing wrong, so that you're completely cleared.”
\p
\v 17 Then Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech and his wife and his slave women so that they could have children,
\v 18 because Yahweh had made every woman in Abimelech's household barren because of \add what had been happening to\add* Abraham's wife, Sarah.

\v 3 Abraham named their son Isaac,

\v 5 Abraham was one hundred years old when his son Isaac was born,

\v 7 And she continued, “Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would breastfeed children, yet I have \add given him\add* a son in his old age.”

\p
\v 8 The child grew and was weaned, and Abraham held a large feast on the day Isaac was weaned.
\p
\v 9 \add But\add* Sarah noticed that \add Ishma'el\add* (the son of Hagar the Egyptian who she had given birth to for Abraham) was mocking,
\v 10 so \add Sarah\add* said to Abraham, “Get rid of that slave woman and her son, because that slave woman's son won't be inheriting \add anything along\add* with my son Isaac.”\x + \xo 21:10: \xt Gal 4:29-30.\x*
\v 11 Now this stressed out Abraham \add who also cared for that\add* son,
\v 12 but God told him, “Don't get distressed because of the boy and your slave woman. Listen to what Sarah's telling you, because it's in Isaac that your descendants will be called yours.\x + \xo 21:12: \xt Rom 9:7; Heb 11:18.\x*
\v 13 \add But\add* I'll also make the descendants of the slave woman's son into a nation, because he's \add also\add* your \add son\add*.”
\p
\v 14 Abraham got up early the \add next\add* morning, and got some bread and a skin of water and helped Hagar put them on her shoulder. Then he gave her the child and sent her away, and she left and wandered in the wilderness around Beersheba.
\v 15 \add But\add* when the water from the skin was gone, she threw the child under one of the bushes,
\v 16 and she went and she went a short distance away (about as far as a bow can shoot an arrow) and sat down there, because she said, “I don't want to watch my child die.” And as she sat at a distance, she sobbed loudly.
\p
\v 17 Now God heard the boy's voice, so \add one of\add* God's messengers called Hagar from heaven and said to her, “What's the matter, Hagar? Don't be afraid, because God has heard the boy's voice over there.
\v 18 Get up and get the boy and hold on to him by the hand, because I'll make \add his descendants\add* into a great nation.”
\v 19 Then God \add enabled her to see\add* a well, so she went and filled the skin with water and gave the boy a drink.
\p
\v 20 As the boy grew up, God \add kept watch over\add* him, and he lived in the wilderness and became an \add expert with the bow and arrow\add*.
\v 21 He settled in the Paran wilderness, and \add in due course\add* his mother found an Egyptian girl for him to marry.
\s1 Abraham and Abimelech's agreement

\p
\v 22 \add One day \add King\add* Abimelech and Phicol, the commander of his army, spoke to Abraham, saying, “\add We can see that\add* God is with you in everything you do.\add* \x + \xo 21:22: \xt Gen 26:26.\x*
\v 23 So then, swear to me here by God \add that you won't treat\add* me or my children or my descendants \add badly\add*, and that'll you'll be kind to this country just as I showed kindness to you.”
\p
\v 24 “I swear it,” Abraham replied.
\p
\v 25 \add But\add* Abraham complained to Abimelech about a well of water that had been taken over by Abimelech's servants.
\v 26 “I don't know who did that,” Abimelech responded, “and you hadn't told me about it, so I've only just heard about it today.”
\v 27 Then Abraham gave \add some\add* sheep and cattle to Abimelech to confirm their agreement together,
\v 28 and \add then\add* he separated seven female lambs from the rest of the flock.
\v 29 “Why did you pen those seven lambs,” Abimelech asked.
\p
\v 30 “Because I want you to take them,” Abraham insisted. “I want them to be the verification that it was \em me\em* who dug this well.”
\v 31 So that's why the place was named ‘Beersheba’ \add (which means ‘Well of the seven’ or ‘Well of the oath’)\add*, because that's where the two of them made their agreement.
\p
\v 32 So the agreement was made at Beersheba, then Abimelech and Phicol, the commander of his army, got up and returned \add home\add* to the Philistine region.
\v 33 Then \add Abraham\add* planted a tamarisk tree there at Beersheba, and he prayed to Yahweh, the God of eternity.

\p
\v 1 \add Several years later,\add* God \add decided to\add* test Abraham, calling him, “Abraham.”\x + \xo 22:1-13: \xt Heb 11:17-19.\x*
\p “Here I am,” he replied.
\p
\v 2 “Take your son Isaac who you love, your only son,” God commanded him, “and go to the Moriah region and sacrifice him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains that I'll \add point out\add* to you.”\x + \xo 22:2: \xt 2Ch 3:1.\x*
\p
\v 3 So Abraham got up early in the morning and saddled his donkey. Then he took two of his young men with him and his son Isaac, and he cut \add some\add* firewood for the burnt offering. Then they left to go to the place that God had told him.
\v 4 On the third day Abraham \add looked up ahead\add* and he could see the place from a distance,
\v 5 so he said to his young men, “Stay here by yourselves with the donkey while the boy and I go over there to \add worship God\add*, then we'll come back to you \add here\add*.”
\p
\v 6 So Abraham took the firewood for the burnt offering and put it on his son Isaac, and he carried the fire pot and the knife. Then the two of them went on together,
\v 7 and Isaac asked his father Abraham his father, “My father?”
\p “Yes, son?”, he replied.
\p “We've got the fire and the wood,”, he continued, “but where's the lamb for the burnt offering?”
\p
\v 8 “God will provide the lamb for the burnt offering himself, my son,” Abraham answered, and then the two of them continued on together.
\p
\v 9 Then they came to the place that God had told him, and Abraham built an altar there and arranged the firewood \add on it\add*. Then he tied up his son Isaac and laid him on the altar on top of the wood.\x + \xo 22:9: \xt Jam 2:21.\x*
\v 10 Then Abraham took the knife and raised his arm to kill his son,
\v 11 but one of Yahweh's messengers called to him from the sky and said, “Abraham! Abraham!”
\p “Here I am.” he answered.
\p
\v 12 “Don't lift up your hand against the boy,” \add the messenger\add* continued. “And don't do anything to him, because now I know that you \add respect and obey\add* God, since you haven't withheld your son, your only son, from me.”
\p
\v 13 Then Abraham raised his head and looked around, and wow, there was a ram was behind him, caught by its horns in the thicket. So Abraham went and grabbed the ram and sacrificed it as a burnt offering instead of his son.
\v 14 So Abraham named that place ‘Yahweh will provide’, and to this day it's still said, “Yahweh will provide on his mountain.”
\p
\v 15 Then the Yahweh's messenger called Abraham from the sky a second time
\v 16 saying, “I, Yahweh, make this declaration by my \add authority and truth\add* that because you did that and didn't withhold your only son,\x + \xo 22:16-17: \xt Heb 6:13-14.\x*

\v 2 when she died in \add the city of\add* Kiriath Arba (now \add called\add* Hebron) in the Canaan region. Abraham went in \add by her bed\add* to weep and mourn for her.
\p
\v 3 \add After a time,\add* Abraham got up from beside his dead \add wife\add* and he spoke to Heth's sons, \add requesting\add*,
\v 4 “I'm a foreigner and just staying among you. Give me property for a burial place \add on your land\add* so that I can bury my dead \add wife\add*.”\x + \xo 23:4: \xt Heb 11:9,13; Acts 7:16.\x*
\p
\v 5 Heth's sons replied to Abraham, telling him,
\v 6 “My master, listen to us. You're a mighty prince among us. \add Go ahead and\add* bury your dead in the choicest of our burial places. We've all agreed not to prevent you from burying your dead in any of our cemetaries.”
\p
\v 7 Then Abraham stood and bowed to the Heth's sons who were the owners of the land,
\v 8 and \add asked\add* them, “Since you're all allowing me to bury my dead, listen to me and intercede for me with Zohar's son Ephron,
\v 9 so that he'll \add sell\add* me Machpelah's cave which belongs to him and which is at the end of his field. \add I'll pay\add* full price if he'll give it to me to use as a burial place.”
\p
\v 10 Now Ephron (the Hittite) was sitting \add there\add* among Heth's sons, so he responded to Abraham while the other \add land-owners\add* were listening, along with everyone else at the city gate,
\v 11 “No, my master. Listen to me: I'll \em give\em* you the field and the cave that's in it. I give it to you in front of all these others, then you can bury your dead.”
\p
\v 12 Then Abraham bowed before the people of the land,
\v 13 and he told Ephron while all the others were listening, “But if you would, please listen to me. I'll \add pay\add* the \add value\add* of the field. Accept it from me, then I'll bury my dead there.”
\p
\v 14 Ephron responded to Abraham,
\v 15 “My master, listen to me. That land's worth 400 shekels of silver, but that's nothing between me and you. \add Just go ahead\add* and bury your dead.”
\v 16 So Abraham accepted Ephron's words and weighed out for Ephron the price that he had mentioned in the hearing of Heth's sons: 400 shekels of silver (the currency among the merchants).
\p
\v 17 So Ephron's field that was in Machpelah which faced Mamre (including the field and the cave that was in it, and all the trees that were in the field that was within all of its surrounding borders) was deeded
\v 18 to Abraham as the new owner as witnessed by Heth's son and everyone \add else\add* who had come to the city gate.
\v 19 Then after that, Abraham \add laid the body of\add* his wife Sarah to rest in the cave in Machpelah's field facing Mamre (also called Hebron, in the Canaan region).
\v 20 So the field was deeded as property to Abraham by Heth's sons, including the cave in it for a burial place.

\p
\v 1 Abraham was now getting very old, and Yahweh had blessed him in every way.
\v 2 Then Abraham said to his oldest servant of his househould who was in charge of everything that belonged to him, “Please put your hand under my thigh,
\v 3 and I want you to vow by Yahweh, the God of the heavens and the God of the earth, that you won't select a wife for my son \add Isaac\add* from any of the Canaanite women in this area where we're living.
\v 4 Rather, you should go \add back\add* to my country and to my relatives, and find a wife for \add him there\add*.”
\p
\v 5 “Suppose the woman isn't willing to come \add back\add* with me to this place?” the servant asked. “Should I take your son back to the country that you came from?”
\p
\v 6 “Make sure that you don't take my son back there,” Abraham answered.
\v 7 “Yahweh, the God of the heavens, who took me from my father's house and from the land of my relatives, and who spoke to me and who promised me, saying, ‘I'll give this land to your descendants,’ he'll send his messenger ahead of you, and you'll \add be guaranteed to\add* bring back a wife for my son from there.
\v 8 If \add it turned out that\add* the woman isn't willing to come \add back\add* with you, then you're released from this vow \add to me\add*. \add But still in that case,\add* don't take my son back there!”
\v 9 Then the servant put his hand under the thigh of his master Abraham and promised his \add that he'd follow those instructions.\add*.
\p
\v 10 Then the servant took ten of his master's camels and \add loaded them with\add* all kinds of good things from his master, and \add with his own servants,\add* he travelled to the city of Nahor in the Aram Naharaim \add region\add*.
\v 11 Then on that first evening, he made the camels kneel down outside the city by the well. It was the time that women come out to fetch water,
\v 12 and he prayed, “Yahweh, God of my master Abraham, please cause it to happen right in front of me today that you show kindness toward my master Abraham.
\v 13 See, I'm standing by this \add well\add*, and the young women from the city will be coming out \add here\add* to fetch water.
\v 14 Let it be that if I say to a young woman, ‘Please let me have a drink from your water jar,’ and she says, ‘Sure, and I'll also get more for your camels,’ let her be the one you have appointed for your servant Isaac. And by \add finding\add* her, I'll know that you've shown kindness toward my master.”
\p
\v 15 Now before he'd even finished speaking, then wow, Rebekah arrived with her \add empty\add* water jar on her shoulder. (She was Bethuel's daughter—Bethuel being the son of Abraham's brother Nahor and his wife Milcah.)
\v 16 The young woman was very beautiful and a virgin who hadn't slept with a man. She went down to the well and filled her jar and came \add back\add* up.
\v 17 The servant ran to meet her and said, “Can I have a small drink of water from your jar.”
\p
\v 18 “Drink, my master,” she said and quickly lowered her jar to her hands and gave him a drink,
\v 19 and after she'd finished giving him a drink, she said, “I'll also get water for your camels until they have finished drinking.”
\v 20 Then she hurried and emptied her jar into the trough and ran back to the well to draw \add more\add* water, and she drew \add enough\add* water for all his camels
\v 21 \add while Abraham's servant\add* watched her silently to determine whether Yahweh had made his journey successful or not.
\p
\v 22 Then when the camels had finished drinking, the servant took out an \add expensive\add* gold nose ring and two \add solid\add* gold bracelets for her arms.
\v 23 “Tell me, whose daughter are you?” he asked her. “Is there room at your father's house for us to stay?”
\p
\v 24 “I'm Bethuel's daughter. He's the son of Nahor and Milcah,” she answered.
\v 25 “We've got plenty of both straw and fodder \add for the camels\add*, and there's also a room where you could stay.”
\p
\v 26 Then the \add servant\add* bowed down and worshipped Yahweh
\v 27 and said, “Praised be Yahweh, my master Abraham's God, who hasn't relented from his kindness and faithfulness toward my master. As for me, Yahweh has led me on the road to the home of my master's relatives.”
\p
\v 28 Then the young woman ran \add home\add* and told her mother's household what had happened.
\v 29 Now Rebekah had a brother named Laban, and he ran out to the man at the well.
\v 30 He had seen the nose ring and the bracelets on his sister's arms, and when he'd heard his sister Rebekah's words saying, “This is what the man said to me,” then he went to the man, and indeed, he was \add there\add* standing by the camels at the spring
\v 31 and he \add invited him\add*, “Come, you who're blessed by Yahweh. Why are you standing out here? I've \add already\add* prepared the house and a place for the camels.”
\p
\v 32 So \add Abraham's servant\add* went to the house. Then he unloaded the camels and gave them straw and fodder, and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him.\f + \fr 24:32 \ft It's not certain from the pronouns in the text here, just who did what in this second sentence—whether it was the servant (the guest) or Laban (the host), so other translations might vary.\f*
\v 33 Then food was set out for \add them\add* to eat, but \add Abraham's servant\add* said, “I won't eat until I have \add said what I have to say\add*.”
\p “Speak then,” Laban responded.
\p
\v 34 “I'm one of Abraham's servants,” he said, 
\v 35 and Yahweh has blessed my master a lot, so that he has become wealthy. \add Yahweh\add* has given him cattle, sheep and goats, silver and gold, male and female slaves, and camels and donkeys.
\v 36 And my master's wife Sarah gave birth to a son for my master \add despite\add* her old age, and \add my master\add* has given him everything that he owns.
\v 37 My master made me promise, saying, ‘You mustn't get a wife for my son from Canaanite women whose land I am living in,
\v 38 but rather you must go to my father's house and to my clan, and find a wife for my son \add there\add*.’
\v 39 Then I \add asked\add* my master, ‘Suppose the woman \add refuses\add* to come with me?’
\v 40 And he \add replied\add*, ‘\add The God\add* Yahweh that I obey, he'll send his messenger with you and make your journey succeed, so that you'll find a wife for my son from my clan, and from my father's house.
\v 41 Then you'll be free of your promise: When you go to my clan, and if they won't allow her to \add return with\add* you, then you'll be clear from \add this promise\add*.’
\p
\v 42 “Then today I came to the well, and I said, ‘Yahweh, God of my master Abraham, if it's what you want, make my journey succeed that I have come on.
\v 43 Listen, I'm standing by this well, so let it be that the young woman who comes out to fetch water and I say to her, “Please give me a little water to drink from your jar,”
\v 44 and she replies to me, “Sure, drink, and I will also get water for your camels,” let her be the wife that Yahweh has chosen for the my master's son.’
\v 45 Before I'd finished speaking in my heart, then bewowhold, Rebekah was coming out with her jar on her shoulder. And she went down to the well and drew water, and I asked her, ‘Can I have a drink.’
\v 46 So she hurried and lowered her jar from her \add shoulder\add* and said, ‘Drink, and I'll also water your camels.’ So I drank and she also watered the camels.
\v 47 Then I asked her, ‘Whose daughter are you?’ And she said, ‘The daughter of Bethuel, a son of Nahor and his wife Milcah.’ Then I put the ring on her nose and the bracelets on her arms.
\v 48 Then I bowed down and worshipped and praised my master Abraham's God Yahweh, who led me on the right way to \add find\add* the daughter of my master's brother for his son.
\v 49 And now if you all want to show kindness and faithfulness to my master, tell me. But if not, tell me, so that I \add can decide what to do next\add*.”
\p
\v 50 Then Laban and Bethuel answered, “This matter has come from Yahweh, \add so\add* we're not able to tell you bad or good.
\v 51 \add But\add* listen, Rebekah's \add right here\add*. Take her and go, and let her become the wife of your master's son, as Yahweh has \add indicated\add*.”
\v 52 \add Now\add* when Abraham's servant heard their \add reply\add*, he bowed down to the ground before Yahweh.
\v 53 Then \add he\add* brought out silver and gold jewelry, and clothing, and gave them to Rebekah. And he gave valuable things to her brother and her mother.
\p
\v 54 Then \add Abraham's servant\add* and the men with him ate and drank and stayed \add there overnight\add*. Then in the morning they got up, and he said, “\add Let\add* me \add leave now and return back\add* to my master.”
\p
\v 55 But \add Rebekah's\add* brother and her mother said, “Let the girl stay with us a few days, at least ten. After \add that\add* she can go.”
\p
\v 56 “Don't detain me,” he told them, “since Yahweh has made my journey successful. Send me off so that I \add can return\add* to my master.”
\p
\v 57 “Let's call for the young woman and \add find out what she wants to do\add*.” they responded.
\v 58 So they called for Rebekah and asked her, “Are you \add prepared to leave now\add* with this man?”
\p “\add Yes,\add* I'll go.” she answered.
\p
\v 59 \add So\add* they \add got ready to\add* send off their sister Rebekah with Abraham's servant and his men, along with her \add childhood\add* nurse.
\v 60 They \add prayed\add* a blessed for Rebekah, saying
\q1 “Our sister, may you become the mother of thousands,
\q1 and may your descendants defeat all of their enemies.”
\m
\v 61 Then Rebekah got up with her maids, and they mounted the camels and went with the man. So the servant took Rebekah and left.
\p
\v 62 Meanwhile Isaac was living in the Negev region, and \add had just returned from visiting\add* Be'er-Lahai-Roi.
\v 63 Late on afternoon, he went out to a field to meditate, and when he looked up, he saw some camels approaching.
\v 64 Rebekah \add also\add* looked up and saw Isaac, and dismounted from her camel,
\v 65 asking the servant, “Who's that man in the field who is coming to meet us?”
\p “He's my master,” the servant replied, so she took the veil and covered herself.
\p
\v 66 Then the servant reported everything that he'd done to Isaac.
\v 67 Then Isaac brought her into the tent of Sarah his mother, and he took Rebekah as his wife. And Isaac loved her and he was comforted after his mother\add 's death\add*.

\v 1 Then Abraham married another woman named Keturah,

\v 3 Yokshan fathered Sheba and Dedan, and the descendants of Dedan were the Asshurim, the Letushim, and the Leummim.

\p
\v 22 Yosef continued to live in Egypt, along with \add the rest of\add* his father Yacob's family, until he was 110 years old.
\v 23 He lived long enough to see his son Ephraim's children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren. The children of his grandson Machir, who was Manasseh's son, also grew up around him.
\v 24 Then \add one day\add* Yosef said to his brothers, “I'm about to die, but God will definitely help you all and take you \add and your descendants\add* from this country to the land that he vowed to give to Abraham, Isaac, and Yacob.
\v 25 When God does that, you must take my body \add back to Canaan with you and bury it there\add*.” Then Yosef had \add his brothers and the rest of the descendants of Israel\add* vow \add that they would do that\add*.\x + \xo 50:25: \xt Exo 13:19; Josh 24:32; Heb 11:22.\x*
\v 26 Then Yosef died at the age of 110, and \add the specialists\add* embalmed \add his body\add* and it was put in a coffin in \add a tomb in\add* Egypt.
