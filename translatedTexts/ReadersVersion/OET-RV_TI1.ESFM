\mt1 1 Timothy
\is1 Introduction
\ip Timothy was a Christian from Asia. His mother was a Jew but his father was a Greek. When Paul saw Timothy's genuine faith, he accepted him as one of his companions and helpers at preaching and teaching the good message (Acts 16:1-3) and they had ended up in Ephesus together, where Paul left Timothy behind in order to look after the new believers there. After Timothy had been in Ephesus for some time, Paul sent this letter to him. Timothy's age was likely around thirty at that time.
\ip There seem to be three main purposes in this letter of Paul to Timothy:
\ip 1.) Firstly Paul warned him about false teaching that was affecting the assembly of believers there. This teaching contained the philosphies of both Jews and non-Jews, because according to them, this world that we live in is evil but a person can be saved if they have the correct wisdom or knowledge and doesn't eat certain types of food and doesn't marry. Paul writes that that's not right.
\ip 2.) This letter also teaches about the behaviour of the assembly of believers and about worship. Paul writes about the desired behaviour of teachers of the message, of helpers in the assembly, and of other believers including widows and slaves.
\ip 3.) Finally he advised Timothy how to become good servant of Yeshua the messiah, and concerning his responsibility to believers.

\v 1 \add This letter is from\add* Paul¦137785, an ambassador¦137786 of Yeshua the messiah \add appointed\add* by our saviour¦137794 God's command¦137792 and by Yeshua the messiah who is our hope.
\v 2 \add I'm writing\add* to Timothy¦137804,\x + \xo 1:2: \xt Acts 16:1-3.\x* \add my\add* true child¦137806 in the faith¦137808: \add may you receive\add* grace¦137809, mercy¦137810, and peace¦137811 from God the father¦137814 and from our¦137822 master¦137821, Yeshua¦137818 the messiah¦137817.
\s1 Staying on-track in faith and doctrine
\p
\v 3 When I was going¦137829 to Macedonia I urged you to remain¦137826 there in Ephesus so that you could speak against those preaching a different¦137836 message
\v 4 and advise the believers not to worry about¦137846 myths¦137839 and endless¦137842 genealogies¦137841 which just result in \add useless\add* speculations¦137844 rather¦137847 than them using their faith¦137853 to advance God's plans.
\v 5 The outcome¦137856 of such teaching should be \add demonstrating\add* love¦137860 coming from a pure heart¦137863, a clean conscience¦137865, and selfless faith¦137868.
\v 6 Some others have deviated¦137872 from that, which¦137870 then results in useless¦137875 talk¦137875—
\v 7 they want to be religious teachers¦137878 but they don't understand¦137880 what they're taslking about¦137885 or what they're agreeing to.
\p
\v 8 But we¦137888 know that the \add religious\add* law can be good¦137891 if someone¦137895 is using it¦137896 lawfully¦137897,
\v 9 but other than that, we know that the law isn't made for those who've been forgiven by God. The law was made for those who're disobedient and out of control, those who ignore and disobey God, who don't honour him but rather profane¦137916 him, for those who would murder¦137922 their parents or other people,
\v 10 the sexually¦137923 immoral¦137923, homosexuals¦137924, kidnappers¦137925, liars¦137926, those who falsely accuse others¦137931 in court, and¦137928 those doing anything else that is against the sound¦137933 teaching¦137934
\v 11 that's part of the good¦137939 message¦137939 that honours the wonderful God and which¦137945 was entrusted¦137946 to me.
\s1 Paul thanks God for showing mercy
\p
\v 12 I'm thankful for our¦137959 master¦137958 Yeshua the messiah¦137955 for considering¦137963 me faithful¦137961 and strengthening¦137952 me, and then appointing¦137964 me to serve him
\v 13 even though I used to be a slanderer¦137972 and persecutor¦137974 and abuser¦137976,\x + \xo 1:13: \xt Acts 8:3; 9:1-30.\x* but I was shown¦137978 mercy¦137978 because¦137979 I did it¦137981 in unbelief¦137983 due to my ignorance.
\v 14 The grace¦137987 of our¦137990 master¦137989 so was generous in \add giving me\add* faith¦137992 in and¦137993 love¦137994 for Yeshua¦137998 the messiah¦137997.
\v 15 This saying¦138001 is trustworthy and¦138002 worth¦138005 being accepted¦138004 by everyone: Yeshua¦138008 the messiah¦138007 came¦138009 into this world¦138012 to save¦138014 sinners¦138013, of which I was the worst.
\v 16 And this is why I was shown¦138022 mercy¦138022: so that Yeshua¦138029 the messiah¦138030 can demonstrate his¦138037 great patience¦138034 in me first¦138026 as a pattern¦138036 to all the others who will believe¦138040 in him¦138042 and obtain eternal¦138045 life¦138044.
\v 17 May the king¦138048 of the ages, the indestructable¦138051, invisible¦138052, only God have all the honour¦138056 and¦138057 praise throughout all the ages. May it¦138064 be¦138064 so¦138064.
\p
\v 18 In line with previous prophecies¦138077, I'm entrusting¦138068 you, young Timothy¦138071, with this: fight in this battle for good¦138084,
\v 19 maintaining your faith and your clear conscience¦138090 even though others have turned back and shipwrecked¦138097 their¦138095 faith,
\v 20 including Hymenaeus and¦138101 Alexander¦138102 who I put Satan¦138106 in charge of so that they'd be disciplined¦138108 to stop slandering¦138110.
\c 2
\s1 Expectations for behaviour
\p
\v 1 Then first¦138113 of all I'm urge you all to pray for all people¦138122—petitioning \add to God\add* while also expressing thanks¦138119 for them.
\v 2 So too for kings¦138124 and other prominent¦138129 \add officials\add* so that we¦138136 can live a quiet¦138134 and tranquil¦138132 life with all devoutness¦138139 and dignity¦138141.
\v 3 This is good¦138144 and¦138145 pleasing¦138146 to God our¦138149 saviour¦138149
\v 4 who wants everyone to be saved¦138156 and¦138157 to know the truth¦138160.\x + \xo 2:4: \xt Jn 14:6.\x*
\v 5 There's only one God and also one mediator¦138167 between God and mankind and that's the man¦138171 Yeshua the messiah¦138172
\v 6 who gave¦138175 himself¦138176 as a ransom¦138177 for all people and¦138180 as a testimony¦138182 \add of God's love\add* for all time.
\v 7 I was appointed¦138188\x + \xo 2:7: \xt 2Tim 1:11.\x* to proclaim¦138190 that message and as an ambassador¦138192—no lies, I'm telling you the truth here in the messiah¦138196—and also as a teacher¦138199 of knowledge¦138203 and the truth to non-Jews.
\p
\v 8 That's why I long to see men¦138211 praying¦138209 in every¦138213 country, lifting up their morally-clean hands¦138217 and¦138220 not harbouring anger¦138219 or disunity.
\p
\v 9 Similarly women¦138226 should wear respectable¦138229 clothes that are sensible and modest¦138231,\x + \xo 2:9: \xt 1Pe 3:3.\x* not with braids¦138239 or gold¦138243 or pearls¦138245 or expensive¦138248 clothing
\v 10 but¦138249 with what is fitting for women¦138252 who do good¦138257 things, having declared that they honour God.
\v 11 Woman should be learning¦138261 quietly¦138260 and submissively¦138264,
\v 12 but¦138275 I don't permit¦138271 women¦138268 to be teaching¦138265 or domineering¦138273 men¦138268. They should remain quiet¦138278
\v 13 because Adam was created first¦138281, then Eve,\x + \xo 2:13: a \xt Gen 2:7; \xo b \xt Gen 2:21-22.\x*
\v 14 and it wasn't Adam¦138286 that was seduced¦138288 but rather it was the woman¦138291 that was deceived¦138292 and disobeyed.\x + \xo 2:14: \xt Gen 3:1-6.\x*
\v 15 But women will be saved¦138297 through¦138299 childbearing¦138301 if they¦138303 continue in faith¦138305 and love¦138307 and purity and self-control.

\s1 Qualities of assembly overseers
\p
\v 1 This is a trustworthy saying¦138314: ‘If anyone¦138316 is aspiring¦138318 to be an overseer¦138317, then it's a good¦138319 task that he's desiring¦138321.’
\v 2 So it's fitting¦138323 that an overseer¦138326 be above reproach,\x + \xo 3:2-7: \xt Tit 1:6-9.\x* be the husband¦138331 of one wife¦138330, sober¦138332, sensible¦138334, respectable¦138335, hospitable¦138336, a good teacher¦138337,
\v 3 not dependent on alcohol or greedy or a bully¦138341, but¦138344 rather gentle¦138345, peace-loving¦138346,
\v 4 a good, dignified¦138360 leader in his own home and in disciplining his children¦138354.
\v 5 (If someone¦138363 doesn't know how to lead his¦138371 own household¦138366, how could he take care of God's assembly¦138371.)
\v 6 He mustn't be a new believer because that might lead him to becoming proud and from there to fall into the devil's¦138383 judgement.
\v 7 It's also fitting¦138384 for him to have a good¦138389 reputation with those outside¦138393 the assembly so that he doesn't end up getting mocked and from there falling into the devil's¦138402 trap.
\s1 Qualities of assembly helpers (or deacons/ministers)
\p
\v 8 Similarly helpers in the assembly should also be dignified¦138405, should only speak the truth, shouldn't be greedy¦138413 or addicted¦138411 to wine
\v 9 and should cling to the mystery¦138416 of the faith¦138418 with a clear conscience¦138423.
\v 10 Once they've proven themselves to be without any misconduct, them let them be working \add in the assembly\add*.
\v 11 Their¦138434 wives¦138434 too should be dignified¦138436, should only speak the truth, and should be sober¦138440 and faithful¦138442 in everything they do.
\v 12 These helpers in the assembly should be husbands¦138449 of one wife¦138448, and should lead their children¦138450 and their households¦138456 well.
\v 13 Those helpers who serve¦138460 well will earn a good¦138463 reputation for themselves¦138462 and¦138465 increase in confidence¦138467 in their faith¦138469 in Yeshua the messiah¦138473.
\s1 The announcement of God of truth
\p
\v 14 I am writing¦138477 all this to you in the hope that I can come¦138479 soon,
\v 15 but¦138486 if I get delayed, at least you'll know how to organise God's household¦138493, that is the assembly¦138500 of the living¦138502 God who is the pillar¦138503 and¦138504 foundation¦138505 of the truth¦138507.
\v 16 But yes, this godliness is quite a mystery¦138515: he appeared in a body, was declared innocent by the spirit¦138523, was seen¦138524 by angels¦138525, was preached among¦138527 the nations¦138528, was believed¦138529 in around the world¦138531, and then was taken¦138532 up \add to heaven\add* to be honoured.
\c 4
\s1 False teachings, including what not to eat
\p
\v 1 But the spirit¦138537 is expressly¦138538 saying that in later¦138542 times¦138543, some will pull back from their faith¦138547, listening instead to deceiving¦138550 spirits¦138549 and¦138551 teachings¦138552 of demons¦138554.
\v 2 After suppressing their¦138560 own consciences¦138562, they'll become hypocritical¦138556 liars¦138557,
\v 3 telling people not to get married and¦138577 to keep away from foods¦138566 that God created¦138570 for faithful¦138576 people who know the truth¦138580 to be able to eat with thankfulness¦138574.
\v 4 Every creature¦138583 made by God is good¦138585 and¦138586 nothing¦138587 should be rejected¦138588 but rather be received¦138591 with thanksgiving¦138590
\v 5 because it's made acceptable by God's declaration and¦138597 by prayer.
\s1 The good servant of the messiah Yeshua
\p
\v 6 If you explain these things¦138599 to the believers then you'll be a good servant¦138605 of Yeshua¦138607 the messiah¦138606, growing in the messages¦138611 of faith¦138613 and of the good teachings¦138617 that you have followed¦138620.
\v 7 Refuse to listen to rude jokes and¦138625 conspiracy theories. Instead train¦138630 yourself¦138632 to be godly,
\v 8 because keeping fit is of some benefit, but being godly benefits every part of life, from the present¦138655 life right through to life in the next age.
\p
\v 9 Here is a trustworthy saying¦138661 that's worthy¦138665 of acceptance¦138664 by everyone
\v 10 and it's what we work and strive¦138672 for: we have put our¦138684 hope in the living¦138678 God who is the saviour¦138681 of all people¦138683 and particularly of all believers¦138685,
\v 11 so command¦138686 and¦138688 teach¦138689 these¦138687 things¦138687.
\p
\v 12 Don't let anyone despise¦138694 you just because you're young, but¦138695 be an example¦138696 for the believers¦138699 in your¦138691 speech¦138701 and conduct¦138703, and in love¦138705, faith¦138709, and purity¦138711.
\v 13 Prioritise the public¦138716 reading¦138716 of the scriptures as well as encouraging and teaching¦138720 others until I come.
\v 14 Don't neglect¦138722 the gift¦138726 that you have in you which¦138727 was given¦138728 to you when the council¦138738 of elders¦138738 placed their¦138734 hands¦138735 on you and prophesied¦138731 over you.
\v 15 Keep these¦138742 things in your thoughts so that everyone will be able to see your progress¦138747.
\v 16 Hold on to your own \add integrity\add* and to \add this\add* teaching¦138756, and stay faithful to them, because as you do, you'll be saving¦138764 both yourself and the people listening to you.
\c 5
\s1 Advice about widows, teachers of believers, and slaves
\p
\v 1 Don't scold an elder¦138769 harshly¦138771, but¦138772 encourage him¦138773 as a father¦138775. Encourage younger¦138776 men¦138776 as brothers¦138778,
\v 2 female elders as mothers¦138781 and younger¦138782 ones as sisters¦138784 in all purity¦138787.
\p
\v 3 Show honour¦138789 to widows—the \em real\em* widows that is
\v 4 because if a widow¦138796 has children¦138797 or grandchildren, then they should be learning¦138801 to show their godliness to their own relatives first¦138802, and to be repaying their parents¦138811 \add and grandparents\add* because this is what God expects.
\v 5 A woman¦138821 who is a real widow¦138824 and has been left by herself but puts her hope in God, she is then able to spend her days and nights¦138839 in prayer¦138838 and requesting God's response.
\v 6 But a widow who \add just\add* lives for pleasure is dead inside even though she's still living.
\v 7 You should teach these¦138849 things¦138849, \add Timothy\add*, so that the people don't anger God,
\v 8 because if someone is not providing¦138864 for their own household¦138862, then they've rejected their faith¦138867 \add in God\add* and they're acting worse¦138872 than an unbeliever¦138871.
\p
\v 9 The assembly should enrol¦138874\f + \fr 5:9 \ft It's not specified in the text what they were being enrolled for or into. It's likely that it was a list of widows visited and/or helped by the assembly.\f* widows sixty¦138878 years¦138877 old and over who was the wife¦138882 of a single husband¦138881.
\v 10 She should be known for her good undertakings, for example if she raised¦138888 children¦138888, if she was hospitable to strangers¦138890, if she washed¦138894 the feet¦138893 of believers, if she helped those who were oppressed¦138896, and if she always tried to do what was right.
\p
\v 11 But don't enrol younger¦138903 widows¦138905 because their emotional needs might drive them to want to marry¦138913 again¦138911 rather than to serve the messiah¦138912
\v 12 and we don't want them to be judged because¦138917 they¦138921 couldn't fulfill their¦138918 faith¦138920 commitment.
\v 13 Plus they often follow others in idly going¦138927 around¦138927 houses¦138930, and not just being idle but also gossipping¦138937 and meddling¦138939 and chatting about things¦138941 they shouldn't.
\v 14 That's why I prefer younger¦138946 women¦138946 to be getting married and having children¦138948, to keep house¦138949, and to avoid all situations where others could accuse them.
\v 15 In fact, some have already¦138957 turned¦138960 away to follow Satan¦138964.
\p
\v 16 If any believing¦138969 woman¦138969 has widowed \add relatives\add*, they should continue to help them and not burden the assembly, so then the assembly can assist¦138973 the really¦138982 \add needy\add* widows.
\p
\v 17 An elder¦138988 who has led well should be considered¦138991 worthy¦138991 of double¦138989 honour¦138990, especially those who work hard in studying and¦138997 teaching¦138998 the message¦138996,
\v 18 \x + \xo 5:18: a \xt Deu 25:4; 1Cor 9:9; \xo b \xt Mat 10:10; Luk 10:7.\x*because the scriptures¦139002 say, “Don't muzzle¦139006 the ox working on the threshing¦139008 floor,” and¦139009 “A worker¦139012 deserves their¦139017 wages.”
\v 19 \x + \xo 5:19: \xt Deu 17:6; 19:15.\x*Don't entertain an accusation¦139020 against an elder¦139019 unless there are two¦139027 or three¦139029 witnesses¦139030,
\v 20 but the ones that are sinning¦139033 need to be scolded publicly so that others will be reluctant to do the same.
\p
\v 21 I am telling you these¦139057 things¦139057 in the sight of God and Yeshua the messiah¦139049 and the chosen angels¦139055 so that you can put them into practice without any favouritism or partiality¦139064.
\v 22 Don't rush to lay hands on anyone\f + \fr 5:22 \ft Paul doesn't give more details here, and although Timothy probably knew what he meant, it's less certain to us now. It probably refers to placing hands on others when praying for them, and could refer to praying for healing or similar, or praying for wisdom when dedicating a new leader. (TODO: Need to add cross-references here.)\f* and don't join in other people's sinful schemes, but \add strive to\add* keep yourself¦139073 pure.
\p
\v 23 Just carry on just drinking¦139077 only water¦139077, because¦139082 a little¦139080 bit of wine might be good for your stomach¦139085 and help with your frequent¦139089 bouts of sickness¦139091.
\p
\v 24 The sins of some people are quite¦139096 easy to see, being known ahead of them going¦139098 to face judgement, but other people's sins will only become known later.
\v 25 It's the same with people's good¦139112 deeds—some are quite¦139113 easy to see and¦139115 others¦139117 aren't, but nothing will be hidden¦139119 \add in the end\add*.
\c 6
\p
\v 1 Those who are bonded into slavery¦139127 should consider¦139135 their¦139129 masters¦139131 to be worthy¦139134 of honour¦139133, so that God's name¦139139 and¦139142 message won't be slandered¦139145,
\v 2 and the ones having¦139149 masters who are \add also\add* believers shouldn't despise¦139153 their masters because we're all brothers¦139155. On the contrary, let them serve \add well\add* because the ones benefitting¦139168 from their good work are beloved¦139164 believers.
\s1 Proper teaching¦139170 and true contentment
\p Those \add principles\add* are what you should be teaching and encouraging \add the believers to do\add*.
\v 3 If anyone¦139174 is teaching different¦139175 things and \add their¦139185 living\add* is far from the message¦139181 of our¦139185 master¦139184 Yeshua the messiah¦139187 and from godly teaching,
\v 4 that person is conceited¦139193. They don't know anything, but instead obsess¦139197 about debates¦139199 and quibble¦139201 about messages¦139201, and this leads to strife¦139206, slander¦139207, evil¦139209 suspicions¦139208,
\v 5 and constant¦139210 friction¦139210. People like this have ruined¦139212 their¦139218 minds and been robbed of the truth¦139219, thinking¦139220 that they can gain financially by \add appearing\add* godly.
\p
\v 6 But \add genuine\add* godly living does lead to contentment¦139236 which is a big advantage,
\v 7 because¦139244 we brought nothing¦139237 with us into this world¦139242 and we can't take anything¦139247 out of it either.
\v 8 As long as we have shelter¦139253 and¦139252 sustenance¦139251, then we'll be content.
\v 9 Those who desire wealth fall into temptation¦139262. It's a trap which¦139271 leads to many foolish¦139268 and harmful¦139270 desires, resulting in people¦139274 sinking¦139272 into ruin and destruction
\v 10 because that desire for wealth is the root of all evil¦139283. Some who aspired¦139289 to becoming wealthy wandered¦139290 away from faith¦139293 \add in Yeshua\add* and¦139294 wounded themselves¦139295 with many disappointments.
\s1 The teaching of Paul to Timothy
\p
\v 11 But you¦139300, \add Timothy\add*, as a godly person¦139303, flee from those things¦139306 and instead pursue¦139308 righteousness¦139310, godliness, faith¦139312, love¦139313, endurance¦139314, and gentleness¦139315.
\v 12 Fight the good fight¦139317 of the faith¦139322 in order to take¦139323 hold of the eternal¦139325 life¦139326 which¦139328 you were called¦139330 to when you confessed¦139332 \add wanting to follow Yeshua\add* in front of many witnesses¦139338.
\v 13 I am commanding¦139339 you¦139340 in front of God who gave life¦139346 to everything, and¦139349 in front of Yeshua the messiah¦139350 who testified¦139354 the good¦139359 confession¦139360 to Pontius¦139356 Pilate¦139357,\x + \xo 6:13: \xt Jn 18:37.\x*
\v 14 to obey that command¦139364 faultlessly until¦139367 the return of our¦139372 master¦139371 Yeshua¦139374 the messiah¦139375.
\v 15 He will be revealed in his¦139391 own time—the blessed¦139381 and only God, the king¦139386 over all rulers and the master¦139390 over all masters,
\v 16 the only immortal¦139396 one who lives in unapproachable¦139399 brightness which no person has ever seen or is capable of looking at. He will be honoured¦139409 for his eternal¦139413 power. May¦139414 it¦139414 be so¦139414.
\p
\v 17 Command those who are rich in this present¦139419 age to not be proud and not to put their hope in uncertain¦139431 wealth, but¦139432 in God who richly¦139446 blesses us with all that we need to be happy.
\v 18 They should live out goodness, doing good deeds, helping others and being¦139450 generous¦139456,
\v 19 thus they will be building themselves¦139458 a good¦139460 foundation¦139459 for the coming¦139463 age so that they may experience true life¦139469.
\p
\v 20 So Timothy¦139471, guard¦139475 what has been invested in you. Avoid useless and godless babbling¦139479 and what others call knowledge¦139484 but which opposes¦139481 the true message
\v 21 and which¦139485 some who were believers have turned away to.
\p May \add God's\add* grace¦139493 be with you¦139496 all \add there\add*.
