\mt1 1 Timothy
\is1 Introduction
\ip Timothy was a Christian from Asia. His mother was a Jew but his father was a Greek. When Paul saw Timothy's genuine faith, he accepted him as one of his companions and helpers at preaching and telling of good message (Acts 16:1-3) and they had ended up in Ephesus together, where Paul left Timothy behind in order to look after the new believers there. After Timothy had been in Ephesus for some time, Paul sent this letter to him. Timothy's age was likely around thirty at that time.
\ip There are three purposes in this letter of Paul to Timothy:
\ip 1.) The first purpose of Paul, warned sikandin concerning the not true/correct teaching there to group of believers. This teaching, nenekegsewug e of me suman-suman of Jews and of non-Jews. Su sumale kandan bad this the world mig-ugpaan ta. Ne and kun just egkaluwas the person ke due wisdom/knowledge din and not egpangeen of duma class of food and not also eg-asawa. Taught si Paul not true/correct sika.
\ip 2.) Taught again this letter concerning the carrying of group of believers and of worshipping. Written here the correct behaviour of one teacher of believers, of helper of believers and of duma believers widows and slaves.
\ip 3.) Finally he advised Timothy how to become good servant of Jesus the messiah, and concerning his responsibility to believers.

\v 1 \add This letter is from\add* Paul, an ambassador¦137786 of Jesus the messiah \add appointed\add* by our saviour God's command¦137792 and by Jesus the messiah who is our hope.
\v 2 \add I'm writing\add* to Timothy,\x + \xo 1:2: \xt Acts 16:1-3.\x* \add my\add* true child¦137806 in the faith¦137808: \add may you receive\add* grace¦137809, mercy¦137810, and peace¦137811 from God the father¦137814 and from our master¦137821, Jesus the messiah.
\s1 Staying on-track in faith and doctrine
\p
\v 3 When I was going¦137829 to Macedonia I urged you to remain¦137826 there in Ephesus so that you could speak against those preaching a different message
\v 4 and advise the believers not to worry about myths and endless genealogies which just result in \add useless\add* speculations rather than them using their faith¦137853 to advance God's plans.
\v 5 The outcome of such teaching should be \add demonstrating\add* love¦137860 coming from a pure heart¦137863, a clean conscience, and selfless faith¦137868.
\v 6 Some others have deviated from that, which then results in useless talk¦137875—
\v 7 they want to be religious teachers¦137878 but they don't understand what they're taslking about or what they're agreeing to.
\p
\v 8 But we¦137888 know that the \add religious\add* law can be good¦137891 if someone is using it¦137896 lawfully,
\v 9 but other than that, we know that the law isn't made for those who've been forgiven by God. The law was made for those who're disobedient and out of control, those who ignore and disobey God, who don't honour him but rather profane him, for those who would murder their parents or other people,
\v 10 the sexually immoral, homosexuals, kidnappers, liars, those who falsely accuse others in court, and¦137928 those doing anything else that is against the sound teaching
\v 11 that's part of the good¦137939 message¦137939 that honours the wonderful God and which was entrusted to me.
\s1 Paul thanks God for showing mercy
\p
\v 12 I'm thankful for our master¦137958 Jesus the messiah for considering me faithful and strengthening me, and then appointing me to serve him
\v 13 even though I used to be a slanderer and persecutor and abuser,\x + \xo 1:13: \xt Acts 8:3; 9:1-30.\x* but I was shown mercy¦137978 because I did it¦137981 in unbelief due to my ignorance.
\v 14 The grace¦137987 of our master¦137989 so was generous in \add giving me\add* faith¦137992 in and¦137993 love¦137994 for Jesus¦137998 the messiah.
\v 15 This saying¦138001 is trustworthy and¦138002 worth being accepted by everyone: Jesus the messiah came¦138009 into this world to save¦138014 sinners¦138013, of which I was the worst.
\v 16 And this is why I was shown mercy¦138022: so that Jesus the messiah can demonstrate his great patience in me first as a pattern to all the others who will believe in him¦138042 and obtain eternal life¦138044.
\v 17 May the king¦138048 of the ages, the indestructable, invisible, only God have all the honour¦138056 and¦138057 praise throughout all the ages. May it be so.
\p
\v 18 In line with previous prophecies, I'm entrusting you, young Timothy, with this: fight in this battle for good¦138084,
\v 19 maintaining your faith and your clear conscience even though others have turned back and shipwrecked their faith,
\v 20 including Hymenaeus and¦138101 Alexander who I put Satan in charge of so that they'd be disciplined to stop slandering.
\c 2
\s1 Expectations for behaviour
\p
\v 1 Then first of all I'm urge you all to pray for all people¦138122—petitioning \add to God\add* while also expressing thanks for them.
\v 2 So too for kings¦138124 and other prominent \add officials\add* so that we¦138136 can live a quiet and tranquil life with all devoutness and dignity.
\v 3 This is good¦138144 and¦138145 pleasing to God our¦138149 saviour
\v 4 who wants everyone to be saved¦138156 and¦138157 to know the truth¦138160.\x + \xo 2:4: \xt Jn 14:6.\x*
\v 5 There's only one God and also one mediator between God and mankind and that's the man¦138171 Jesus the messiah
\v 6 who gave himself¦138176 as a ransom for all people and¦138180 as a testimony¦138182 \add of God's love\add* for all time.
\v 7 I was appointed\x + \xo 2:7: \xt 2Tim 1:11.\x* to proclaim that message and as an ambassador¦138192—no lies, I'm telling you the truth here in the messiah—and also as a teacher¦138199 of knowledge and the truth to non-Jews.
\p
\v 8 That's why I long to see men¦138211 praying in every country, lifting up their morally-clean hands¦138217 and¦138220 not harbouring anger¦138219 or disunity.
\p
\v 9 Similarly women¦138226 should wear respectable clothes that are sensible and modest,\x + \xo 2:9: \xt 1Pe 3:3.\x* not with braids or gold¦138243 or pearls or expensive clothing
\v 10 but¦138249 with what is fitting for women¦138252 who do good¦138257 things, having declared that they honour God.
\v 11 Woman should be learning¦138261 quietly and submissively,
\v 12 but¦138275 I don't permit women¦138268 to be teaching or domineering men¦138268. They should remain quiet
\v 13 because Adam was created first, then Eve,\x + \xo 2:13: a \xt Gen 2:7; \xo b \xt Gen 2:21-22.\x*
\v 14 and it wasn't Adam¦138286 that was seduced¦138288 but rather it was the woman¦138291 that was deceived¦138292 and disobeyed.\x + \xo 2:14: \xt Gen 3:1-6.\x*
\v 15 But women will be saved¦138297 through childbearing if they¦138303 continue in faith¦138305 and love¦138307 and purity and self-control.

\s1 Qualities of an overseer
\p
\v 1 This is a trustworthy saying¦138314: ‘If anyone is aspiring to be an overseer, then it's a good¦138319 task that he's desiring.’
\v 2 So it's fitting that an overseer be above reproach,\x + \xo 3:2-7: \xt Tit 1:6-9.\x* be the husband¦138331 of one wife¦138330, sober, sensible, respectable, hospitable, a good teacher,
\v 3 not dependent on alcohol or greedy or a bully, but¦138344 rather gentle, peace-loving,
\v 4 a good, dignified leader in his own home and in disciplining his children¦138354.
\v 5 (If someone doesn't know how to lead his own household, how could he take care of God's assembly.)
\v 6 He mustn't be a new believer because that might lead him to becoming proud and from there to fall into the devil's judgement.
\v 7 It's also fitting for him to have a good reputation with those outside the assembly so that he doesn't end up getting mocked and from there falling into the devil's trap.
\s1 The behaviour of helper of believers
\p
\v 8 Similarly servants should also be dignified, should only speak the truth, shouldn't be greedy or addicted to wine
\v 9 and should cling to the mystery of the faith with a clear conscience.
