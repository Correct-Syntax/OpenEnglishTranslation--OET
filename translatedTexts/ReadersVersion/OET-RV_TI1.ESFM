\mt2 Paul's first letter to
\mt1 Timothy
\is1 Introduction
\ip Timothy was a Christian from Asia. His mother was a Jew but his father was a Greek. When Paul saw Timothy's genuine faith, he accepted him as one of his companions and helpers at preaching and teaching the good message (Acts 16:1-3) and they had ended up in Ephesus together, where Paul left Timothy behind in order to look after the new believers there. After Timothy had been in Ephesus for some time, Paul sent this letter to him. Timothy's age was likely around thirty at that time.
\ip There seem to be three main purposes in this letter of Paul to Timothy:
\ip 1.) Firstly Paul warned him about false teaching that was affecting the assembly of believers there. This teaching contained the philosphies of both Jews and non-Jews, because according to them, this world that we live in is evil but a person can be saved if they have the correct wisdom or knowledge and doesn't eat certain types of food and doesn't marry. Paul writes that that's not right.
\ip 2.) This letter also teaches about the behaviour of the assembly of believers and about worship. Paul writes about the desired behaviour of teachers of the message, of helpers in the assembly, and of other believers including widows and slaves.
\ip 3.) Finally he advised Timothy how to become good servant of Yeshua the messiah, and concerning his responsibility to believers.

\v 3 When I was going¦137807 to Macedonia¦137809 I urged¦137802 you to remain¦137804 there in Ephesus¦137806 so that you could speak against those preaching a different¦137814 message
\v 4 and advise the believers not to worry about¦137824 myths¦137817 and endless¦137820 genealogies¦137819 which just result in \add useless\add* speculations¦137822 rather¦137825 than them using their faith¦137831 to advance God's plans.
\v 5 The outcome¦137834 of such teaching should be \add demonstrating\add* love¦137838 coming from a pure heart¦137841, a clean conscience¦137843, and selfless faith¦137846.
\v 6 Some others have deviated¦137850 from that, which¦137848 then results in useless¦137853 talk¦137853—
\v 7 they want to be religious teachers¦137856 but they don't¦137857 understand¦137858 what they're talking¦137861 about¦137863 or what they're agreeing¦137865 to.
\p
\v 8 But we¦137866 know that the \add religious\add* law can be good¦137869 if someone¦137873 is using it¦137874 lawfully¦137875,
\v 9 but other than that, we know that the law isn't made for those who've been forgiven by God. The law was made for those who're disobedient and out of control, those who ignore and disobey God, who don't¦137883 honour him but rather profane¦137894 him, for those who would murder¦137900 their parents or other people,
\v 10 the sexually¦137901 immoral¦137901, homosexuals¦137902, kidnappers¦137903, liars¦137904, those who falsely accuse others¦137909 in court, and¦137906 those doing anything else that is against the sound¦137911 teaching¦137912
\v 11 that's part of the good¦137917 message¦137917 that honours the wonderful \nd God¦137922\nd* and which¦137923 was entrusted¦137924 to me.

\v 12 I'm thankful for our¦137937 \nd master¦137936\nd* \nd Yeshua¦137934\nd* the \nd messiah¦137933\nd* for considering¦137941 me faithful¦137939 and strengthening¦137930 me, and then appointing¦137942 me to serve him
\v 13 even though I used to be a slanderer¦137950 and persecutor¦137952 and abuser,\x + \xo 1:13: \xt Acts 8:3; 9:1-30.\x*but I was shown¦137956 mercy¦137956 because¦137957 I did it¦137959 in unbelief¦137961 due to my ignorance.
\v 14 \nd The\nd* grace¦137965 of our¦137968 \nd master¦137967\nd* so was generous in \add giving me\add* faith¦137970 in and¦137971 love¦137972 for \nd Yeshua¦137976\nd* the \nd messiah¦137975\nd*.
\v 15 This saying¦137979 is trustworthy and¦137980 worth¦137983 being accepted¦137982 by everyone: \nd Yeshua¦137986\nd* the \nd messiah¦137985\nd* came¦137987 into this world¦137990 to save¦137992 sinners¦137991, of which I was the worst.
\v 16 And this is why I was shown¦138000 mercy¦138000: so that \nd Yeshua¦138007\nd* the \nd messiah¦138008\nd* can demonstrate his great patience¦138012 in me first¦138004 as a pattern¦138014 to all the others who will believe¦138018 in him¦138020 and obtain eternal¦138023 life¦138022.
\v 17 May the king¦138026 of the ages, the indestructable¦138029, invisible¦138030, only \nd God¦138033\nd* have all the honour¦138034 and¦138035 praise throughout all the ages. May it¦138042 be¦138042 so¦138042.

\v 18 In line with previous prophecies¦138055, I'm entrusting¦138046 you, young Timothy¦138049, with this: fight in this battle for good¦138062,
\v 19 maintaining your faith and your clear conscience¦138068 even though others have turned back and shipwrecked¦138075 their¦138073 faith,
\v 20 including Hymenaeus and¦138079 Alexander¦138080 who I put Satan¦138084 in charge of so that they'd be disciplined¦138086 to stop slandering¦138088.

\v 1 Then first¦138091 of all I urge you all to pray for all people¦138100—petitioning \add to God\add* while also expressing thanks¦138097 for them.
\v 2 So too for kings¦138102 and other prominent¦138107 \add officials\add* so that we¦138114 can live a quiet¦138112 and tranquil¦138110 life with all devoutness¦138117 and dignity¦138119.
\v 3 This is good¦138122 and¦138123 pleasing¦138124 to \nd God¦138129\nd* our¦138128 saviour¦138127
\v 4 who wants everyone¦138132 to be saved¦138134 and¦138135 to know¦138137 the truth¦138138.\x + \xo 2:4: \xt Jn 14:6.\x*
\v 5 There's only one God and also one mediator¦138145 \nd between¦138146\nd* God and mankind¦138148 and that's the man \nd Yeshua¦138151\nd* the \nd messiah¦138150\nd*
\v 6 who gave¦138153 himself¦138154 as a ransom¦138155 for all people and¦138158 as a testimony¦138160 \add of God's love\add* for all time.
\v 7 I was appointed\x + \xo 2:7: \xt 2Tim 1:11.\x*to proclaim¦138168 that message and as an missionary—no lies, I'm telling you the truth here in the \nd messiah¦138174\nd*—and also as a teacher¦138177 of knowledge¦138181 and the truth to non-Jews¦138178.
\p
\v 8 That's why I long to see men¦138189 praying¦138187 in every¦138191 country, lifting up their morally-clean hands¦138195 and¦138198 not harbouring anger¦138197 or disunity.
\p
\v 9 Similarly¦138201 women¦138204 should wear respectable¦138207 clothes¦138206 that are sensible and modest,\x + \xo 2:9: \xt 1Pe 3:3.\x*not with braids¦138217 or gold¦138221 or pearls¦138223 or expensive¦138226 clothing
\v 10 but¦138227 with what is fitting¦138229 for women¦138230 who do good¦138235 things, having declared that they honour God.
\v 11 Women should be learning¦138239 quietly¦138238 and submissively¦138242,
\v 12 but¦138253 I don't¦138248 permit¦138249 women¦138246 to be teaching¦138243 or domineering¦138251 men. They should remain quiet¦138256
\v 13 because Adam¦138257 was created first¦138259, then Eve¦138262,\x + \xo 2:13: a \xt Gen 2:7; \xo b \xt Gen 2:21-22.\x*
\v 14 and it wasn't Adam¦138264 that was seduced¦138266 but rather it was the woman¦138269 that was deceived¦138270 and disobeyed.\x + \xo 2:14: \xt Gen 3:1-6.\x*
\v 15 But women will be saved¦138275 through¦138277 childbearing¦138279 if they¦138281 continue in faith¦138283 and love¦138285 and purity¦138287 and self-control.

\v 1 This is a trustworthy saying¦138292: ‘If anyone¦138294 is aspiring¦138296 to be an overseer¦138295, then it's a good¦138297 task that he's desiring¦138299.’
\v 2 So it's fitting¦138301 that an overseer¦138304 be above reproach,\x + \xo 3:2-7: \xt Tit 1:6-9.\x*be the husband¦138309 of one wife¦138308, sober¦138310, sensible¦138312, respectable¦138313, hospitable¦138314, a good teacher¦138315,

\v 4 a good, dignified¦138338 leader in his own home and in disciplining his children¦138332.
\v 5 (If someone¦138341 doesn't know how to lead his own household¦138344, how could he take care of God's assembly¦138349.)
\v 6 He mustn't be a new believer because that might lead him to becoming proud and from there to fall into the devil's¦138361 judgement.
\v 7 It's also fitting¦138362 for him to have a good¦138367 reputation with those outside¦138371 the assembly so that he doesn't end up getting mocked and from there falling into the devil's¦138380 trap.

\v 8 Similarly helpers in the assembly should also be dignified¦138383, should only speak the truth, shouldn't be greedy¦138391 or addicted¦138389 to wine
\v 9 and should cling to the mystery¦138394 of the faith¦138396 with a clear conscience¦138401.
\v 10 Once they've proven themselves to be without any misconduct, them let them be working \add in the assembly\add*.
\v 11 Their¦138412 wives¦138412 too should be dignified¦138414, should only speak the truth, and should be sober¦138418 and faithful¦138420 in everything they do.
\v 12 These helpers in the assembly should be husbands¦138427 of one wife¦138426, and should lead their children¦138428 and their households¦138434 well.
\v 13 \nd Those\nd* helpers who serve¦138438 well will earn a good¦138441 reputation for themselves¦138440 and¦138443 increase in confidence¦138445 in their faith¦138447 in \nd Yeshua¦138452\nd* the \nd messiah¦138451\nd*.

\v 1 But the \nd spirit¦138515\nd* is expressly¦138516 saying that in later¦138520 times¦138521, some will pull back from their faith¦138525, listening instead to deceiving¦138528 spirits¦138527 and¦138529 teachings¦138530 of demons¦138532.
\v 2 After suppressing their¦138538 own consciences¦138540, they'll become hypocritical¦138534 liars¦138535,

\rem /s1 Advice about Widows, Elders, and Slaves
\p
\v 3 Show honour¦138767 to widows—the \em real\em* widows that is
\v 4 because if a widow¦138774 has children¦138775 or grandchildren, then they should be learning¦138779 to show their godliness to their own relatives first¦138780, and to be repaying their parents¦138789 \add and grandparents\add* because this is what \nd God¦138798\nd* expects.
\v 5 A woman¦138799 who is a real widow¦138802 and has been left by herself but puts her hope in God, she is then able to spend her days and nights¦138817 in prayer¦138816 and requesting God's response.
\v 6 But a widow who \add just\add* lives for pleasure is dead inside even though she's still living.
\v 7 You should teach these¦138827 things¦138827, \add Timothy\add*, so that the people don't anger God,
\v 8 because if someone is not providing¦138842 for their own household¦138840, then they've rejected their faith¦138845 \add in God\add* and they're acting worse¦138850 than an unbeliever¦138849.
\p
\v 9 The assembly should enrol¦138852\f + \fr 5:9 \ft It's not specified in the text what they were being enrolled for or into. It's likely that it was a list of widows visited and/or helped by the assembly.\f* widows sixty¦138856 years¦138855 old and over who was the wife¦138860 of a single husband¦138859.
\v 10 She should be known for her good undertakings, for example if she raised¦138866 children¦138866, if she was hospitable to strangers¦138868, if she washed¦138872 the feet¦138871 of believers, if she helped those who were oppressed¦138874, and if she always tried to do what was right.
\p
\v 11 But don't enrol younger¦138881 widows¦138883 because¦138886 their emotional needs might drive them to want to marry¦138891 again¦138889 rather than to serve the \nd messiah¦138890\nd*
\v 12 and we don't want them to be judged because¦138895 they¦138899 couldn't fulfill their¦138896 faith¦138898 commitment.
\v 13 Plus they often follow others in idly going¦138905 around¦138905 houses¦138908, and not just being idle but also gossipping¦138915 and meddling¦138917 and chatting about things¦138919 they shouldn't.
\v 14 That's why I prefer younger¦138924 women¦138924 to be getting married and having children¦138926, to keep house¦138927, and to avoid all situations where others could accuse them.
\v 15 In fact, some have already¦138935 turned¦138938 away to follow Satan¦138942.
\p
\v 16 If any believing¦138947 woman¦138947 has widowed \add relatives\add*, they should continue to help them and not burden the assembly, so then the assembly can assist¦138951 the really¦138960 \add needy\add* widows.
\p
\v 17 An elder¦138966 who has led well should be considered¦138969 worthy¦138969 of double¦138967 honour¦138968, especially those who work hard in studying and¦138975 teaching¦138976 the message¦138974,
\v 18 \x + \xo 5:18: a \xt Deu 25:4; 1Cor 9:9; \xo b \xt Mat 10:10; Luk 10:7.\x*because the scriptures¦138980 say, “Don't muzzle¦138984 the ox working on the threshing¦138982 floor,” and¦138987 “A worker¦138990 deserves their wages.”
\v 19 \x + \xo 5:19: \xt Deu 17:6; 19:15.\x*Don't entertain an accusation¦138998 against an elder¦138997 unless there are two¦139005 or three¦139007 witnesses¦139008,
\v 20 but the ones that are sinning¦139011 need to be scolded publicly so that others will be reluctant to do the same.
\p
\v 21 I am telling you these¦139035 things¦139035 in the sight of \nd God¦139024\nd* and \nd Yeshua¦139028\nd* the \nd messiah¦139027\nd* and the chosen messengers¦139033 so that you can put them into practice without any favouritism or partiality¦139042.
\v 22 Don't rush to lay hands on anyone\f + \fr 5:22 \ft Paul doesn't give more details here, and although Timothy probably knew what he meant, it's less certain to us now. It probably refers to placing hands on others when praying for them, and could refer to praying for healing or similar, or praying for wisdom when dedicating a new leader.

\p
\v 23 Just carry on just drinking¦139055 only water¦139055, because¦139060 a little¦139058 bit of wine might be good for your stomach¦139063 and help with your frequent¦139067 bouts of sickness¦139069.

\v 24 The sins of some people are quite¦139074 easy to see, being known ahead of them going¦139076 to face judgement, but other people's sins will only become known later.
\v 25 It's the same with people's good¦139090 deeds—some are quite¦139091 easy to see and¦139093 others¦139095 aren't, but nothing will be hidden¦139097 \add in the end\add*.

\v 1 Those who are bonded into slavery¦139105 should consider¦139113 their¦139107 masters¦139109 to be worthy¦139112 of honour¦139111, so that God's name¦139117 and¦139120 message won't be slandered¦139123,
\v 2 and the ones having¦139127 masters who are \add also\add* believers shouldn't despise¦139131 their masters because we're all brothers¦139133. On the contrary, let them serve \add well\add* because the ones benefitting¦139146 from their good work are beloved¦139142 believers.

\p Those \add principles\add* are what you should be teaching and encouraging \add the believers to do\add*.
\v 3 \nd If\nd* anyone¦139152 is teaching different¦139153 things and \add their living\add* is far from the message¦139159 of our¦139163 \nd master¦139162\nd* \nd Yeshua¦139164\nd* the \nd messiah¦139165\nd* and from godly teaching,
\v 4 that person is conceited¦139171. They don't know anything, but instead obsess¦139175 about debates¦139177 and quibble¦139179 about messages¦139179, and this leads to strife¦139184, slander¦139185, evil¦139187 suspicions¦139186,
\v 5 and constant¦139188 friction¦139188. People like this have ruined¦139190 their minds and been robbed of the truth¦139197, thinking¦139198 that they can gain financially by \add appearing\add* godly.
\p
\v 6 But \add genuine\add* godly living does lead to contentment¦139214 which is a big advantage,
\v 7 because¦139222 we brought nothing¦139215 with us into this world¦139220 and we can't take anything¦139225 out of it either.
\v 8 As long as we have shelter¦139231 and¦139230 sustenance¦139229, then we'll be content.
\v 9 Those who desire wealth fall into temptation¦139240. It's a trap which¦139249 leads to many foolish¦139246 and harmful¦139248 desires, resulting in people¦139252 sinking¦139250 into ruin and destruction
\v 10 because that desire for wealth is the root of all evil¦139261. Some who aspired¦139267 to becoming wealthy wandered¦139268 away from faith¦139271 \add in Yeshua\add* and¦139272 wounded themselves¦139273 with many disappointments.

\v 11 But you¦139278, \add Timothy\add*, as a godly person¦139281, flee from those things¦139284 and instead pursue¦139286 righteousness¦139288, godliness, faith¦139290, love¦139291, endurance¦139292, and gentleness¦139293.
\v 12 Fight the good fight¦139295 of the faith¦139300 in order to take¦139301 hold of the eternal¦139303 life¦139304 which¦139306 you were called¦139308 to when you confessed¦139310 \add wanting to follow Yeshua\add* in front of many witnesses¦139316.
\v 13 I am commanding¦139317 you¦139318 in front of \nd God¦139321\nd* who gave life¦139324 to everything, and¦139327 in front of \nd Yeshua¦139329\nd* the \nd messiah¦139328\nd* who testified¦139332 the good¦139337 confession¦139338 to Pontius¦139334 Pilate¦139335,\x + \xo 6:13: \xt Jn 18:37.\x*
\v 14 to obey that command¦139342 faultlessly until¦139345 the return of our¦139350 \nd master¦139349\nd* \nd Yeshua¦139352\nd* the \nd messiah¦139353\nd*.
\v 15 He will be revealed in his own time—the blessed¦139359 and only God, the king¦139364 over all rulers and the \nd master¦139368\nd* over all \nd masters\nd*,
\v 16 the only immortal¦139374 one who lives in unapproachable¦139377 brightness which no person has ever seen or is capable of looking at. He will be honoured¦139387 for his eternal¦139391 power. May¦139392 it¦139392 be so¦139392.
\p
\v 17 Command those who are rich in this present¦139397 age to not be proud and not to put their hope in uncertain¦139408 wealth, but¦139409 in \nd God¦139413\nd* who richly¦139423 blesses us with all that we need to be happy.
\v 18 They should live out goodness, doing good deeds, helping others and being¦139427 generous¦139433,
\v 19 thus they will be building themselves¦139435 a good¦139437 foundation¦139436 for the coming¦139440 age so that they may experience true life¦139446.
