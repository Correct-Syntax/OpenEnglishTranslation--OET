\mt2 The second account by
\mt1 Luke
\mt2 commonly called
\mt1 Acts
\is1 Introduction
\is2 Author
\ip This account commonly known as \bk The Acts of the missionaries of Yeshua the Messiah\bk*, is the continuation of \bk The Good Message according to Luke\bk*, and unlike most other Bibles, the \em Open English Translation\em* places these two accounts one after the other.
\is2 This account
\ip The main purpose of this account is to tell about the actions of the first followers of Yeshua the messiah. The spirit of the master helped them to proclaim good message about him “in Yerusalem and all across \add the provinces of\add* Yudea and Samaria, and all the way to the furtherest parts of the planet” (1:8).
\ip This document has three divisions related to the expanding circles as the good message from Yeshua the messiah spread wider and wider: (1) In \bd Yerusalem\bd* where the believers start to get organised after Yeshua ascended up into the clouds; (2) the work and the message spreads wider out to all of the district of \bd Yudea\bd*; and (3) spreading more widely again around the Mediterranean Ocean and all the way to \bd Rome\bd*.
\ip It's also documented here about how God's spirit came to the believers as they were together in a room in Yerusalem at the Feast of Pentecost (fifty days after The Passover). The spirit helps and gives wisdom and strength to the believers and teachers of believers.

\s1 Introduction
\rem /s1 The Promise of the Holy Spirit
\rem /s1 Jesus Taken Up Into Heaven
\p
\v 1 \x + \xo 1:1: \xt Luk 1:1-4.\x*Dear Theophilus¦82401, I wrote my first¦82395 account¦82396 about all the things that \nd Yeshua¦82405\nd* began¦82403 to do and¦82408 to teach¦82409
\v 2 until¦82410 the day¦82412 when he was taken¦82422 up\x + \xo 1:1: \xt Luk 24:51.\x* \add into the sky\add* after, with the help of the holy \nd spirit¦82418\nd*, having¦82414 commanded¦82414 the missionaries that he had chosen¦82421.
\s1 Yeshua, alive, tells them to wait
\p
\v 3 After the time¦82436 of his suffering¦82437, Yeshua presented¦82432 himself¦82433 to them in ways that were infallible proofs¦82441 \add that he was alive again\add*—appearing¦82446 to them and telling them about God's kingdom¦82455.
\v 4 \x + \xo 1:4: \xt Luk 24:49.\x*Once when they were together¦82459, he told them, “\wj Don't leave Yerusalem¦82467, but wait there for what was promised¦82473 by the father¦82475, as you all have \add already\add* heard¦82477 me say.\wj*
\v 5 \x + \xo 1:5: \xt Mat 3:11; Mrk 1:8; Luk 3:16; Jn 1:33.\x*\wj Yohan¦82485 immersed \add people\add* in water¦82488, but you all will be immersed in the holy \nd spirit¦82493\nd* in just a few days¦82505.\wj*”
\s1 Yeshua's ascension
\rem /s1 The Ascension of Jesus
\rem /s1 Jesus Is Taken Up to Heaven
\p
\v 6 So¦82511 when they were \add next\add* gathered together¦82513, they asked him¦82517, “\nd Master¦82519\nd*, is this now the time when you'll be restoring¦82525 the kingdom¦82528 to Israel¦82531?”\f + \fr 1:6 \ft At the time of asking, Israelis were burdened under the rule and taxes of the Roman occupiers.\f*
\p
\v 7 But Yeshua responded to them, “\wj You don't¦82540 need to know¦82543 the times¦82544 or seasons¦82546 \add when future events will happen\add*—it's the father¦82549 who decides all that.\wj*
\v 8 \x + \xo 1:8: \xt Mat 28:19; Mrk 16:15; Luk 24:47-48.\x*\wj However, you all will be receiving¦82556 power¦82557 when the holy \nd spirit¦82561\nd* lands on you. Then you'll tell \add people\add* about me in Yerusalem¦82571 and all across \add the provinces of\add* Yudea¦82576 and Samaria¦82578, and all the way to the furtherest parts of the planet.\wj*”
\v 9 \x + \xo 1:9: \xt Mrk 16:19; Luk 24:50-51.\x*After he'd said¦82587 that and while they were still looking at him, he was lifted¦82594 up \add into the sky\add* until they could no longer see him because of the cloud\add s\add*.
\p
\v 10 As they¦82609 stood¦82619 there staring into the sky¦82612 after he'd gone, suddenly two¦82618 men¦82617 in white¦82626 clothes¦82623 were standing beside them
\v 11 and said, “You men from Galilee¦82632! Why are you still standing there looking¦82635 up at the sky? This \nd Yeshua¦82642\nd* who has been taken¦82644 up away from you into heaven will come back in the same way that you saw him go up into heaven.”

\p
\v 12 Then¦82663 they¦82661 walked down the Mount¦82665 of Olives¦82668 and returned¦82661 to Yerusalem¦82672 which was less than a kilometre away.
\v 13 \x + \xo 1:13: \xt Mat 10:2-4; Mrk 3:16-19; Luk 6:14-16.\x*They went¦82686 into the upstairs¦82685 room where¦82687 they were staying¦82689—Peter and Yohan¦82695, Yacob and Andrew¦82700, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew¦82704 and Matthew¦82706, Yacob (son of Alpheus), Simon¦82712 (the Zealot member¦82714), and Yudas (son of Yacob).
\v 14 They were united in their ongoing prayers¦82725, along with Maria¦82735 the mother¦82738 of \nd Yeshua¦82740\nd*, and his¦82745 brothers¦82744.
\p
\v 15 Then one day, Peter stood¦82752 up in the meeting of the believers¦82758 (about¦82771 120¦82773 of them) and¦82762 said¦82760,
\v 16 “Brothers¦82776, it was necessary¦82777 for the scripture¦82781 to be fulfilled¦82779, where the holy \nd spirit¦82786\nd* had spoken¦82784 previously¦82784 through David¦82791 about Yudas¦82793, the one who guided¦82796 those that arrested¦82798 \nd Yeshua¦82800\nd*
\v 17 because Yudas was one of us and¦82807 took his part in our work¦82813.
\p
\v 18 \x + \xo 1:18-19: \xt Mat 27:3-8.\x*(Yudas had bought a field with the money¦82822 he had received for his treachery, and when he had fallen down \add in that field\add*, his stomach had burst¦82829 open and his intestines¦82835 had slid out \add on the ground\add*.
\v 19 So everyone in Yerusalem¦82845 started calling¦82847 that place ‘The field of blood¦82860’.)
\p
\v 20 \x + \xo 1:20: a \xt Psa 69:25; \xo b \xt Psa 109:8.\x*Now it was written¦82861 in the scroll¦82864 of songs¦82865:
\q1 ‘Let his place become¦82866 deserted¦82870 with no one living¦82876 there,’
\m and
\q1 ‘Let another¦82885 person take¦82884 his position.’
\p
\v 21 So¦82887 now it's appropriate¦82886 for one of the men¦82891 that has been with us for the whole time¦82895 that the \nd master¦82905 Yeshua¦82906\nd* was interacting with us,
\v 22 \x + \xo 1:22: a \xt Mat 3:16; Mrk 1:9; Luk 3:21; \xo b \xt Mrk 16:19; Luk 24:51.\x*from Yeshua's immersion¦82911 by Yohan¦82912 until¦82914 the day¦82916 that he was lifted up from us \add into the clouds\add*—a witness¦82921 of the resurrection¦82923—to fill this position.
\p
\v 23 So they¦82932 selected two¦82934 men: Yosef Barsabbas¦82939 (nicknamed Justus¦82942) and¦82943 Matthias¦82944.
\v 24 Then they requested¦82947, “\nd Master¦82952\nd*, you know everyone's inner thoughts, so reveal¦82955 to us which¦82956 of these¦82959 two¦82961 that you have chosen¦82957
\v 25 to take this position of service¦82973 and being an missionary—the position that Yudas¦82981 deserted to go to his own place.”
\v 26 So they drew straws and Matthias¦83000 was marked so he was chosen¦83004 to join the eleven¦83008 missionaries.

\p
\v 1 \x + \xo 2:1: \xt Lev 23:15-21; Deu 16:9-11.\x*When the Day of Pentecost actually arrived, the believers met together¦83030 in the same¦83034 room¦83034.
\v 2 Suddenly there was a noise in the sky that sounded¦83042 like a strong¦83046 wind¦83045, then it¦83049 filled¦83049 the entire¦83051 house¦83053 where¦83054 they¦83055 were sitting¦83057.
\v 3 They saw what looked like tongues¦83062 of fire¦83064 that kept dividing¦83061\f + \fr 3:1 \ft See https://www.billmounce.com/monday-with-mounce/what-%E2%80%9Cdivided-tongue%E2%80%9D-acts-2-3-0\f* and¦83065 then settling down on each one of them.
\v 4 In this way they were all filled¦83075 with the holy spirit and began¦83081 speaking in other¦83084 languages¦83085 as the spirit enabled them.
\p
\v 5 At the time, there were godly¦83105 Jews¦83103 staying¦83101 in Yerusalem¦83098 that had come from other countries¦83109 all around the world.
\v 6 When they heard this noise, lots of people¦83121 came¦83119 to investigate but they were confused¦83123 because¦83125 they heard the believers talking¦83134 in their¦83138 own languages¦83133 \add from around the world\add*.
\v 7 They were astounded¦83139 and¦83143 marvelled¦83144, asking, “Wow, aren't these¦83153 people talking¦83156 all Galileans¦83158?
\v 8 So how come we're hearing¦83162 them speak the languages¦83167 of the countries where we were born?
\v 9 There's people here from Parthia¦83174, Media¦83176, Elam, Mesopotamia¦83183, Yudea¦83184, Cappadocia¦83187, Pontus¦83188, Asia \add Minor\add*,
\v 10 Phrygia, Pamphylia, Egypt¦83196, Libya (near Cyrene), and visitors¦83208 from Rome,
\v 11 Crete, and Arabia¦83217. Some are Jews and some are non-Jews who've converted¦83213 \add to Judaism\add*. And we¦83219 can hear¦83219 them talking¦83220 about \nd God¦83228\nd* in our¦83223 languages¦83224.”
\v 12 Everyone was amazed¦83229 and¦83232 totally puzzled, asking each other, “What's¦83243 going on here?”
\v 13 But others¦83250 scoffed¦83252 and said, “Ha, they've just had too much to drink.”

\p
\v 14 So the twelve stood¦83263 up and Peter told the crowd in a loud voice¦83275, “People of Yudea¦83283 and everyone staying¦83287 in Yerusalem¦83288. Listen to me so that I can explain this to you.
\v 15 This group is not drunk¦83308 like you're all thinking¦83306, because¦83312 it's still mid-morning,
\v 16 but¦83319 you're seeing what the prophet¦83326 Yoel¦83327 wrote about:
\q1
\v 17 \x + \xo 2:17-21: \xt Yoel 2:28-32 (LXX).\x*God said, ‘In the last days¦83335 I will pour out my¦83344 \nd spirit¦83343\nd* on all humanity—your children will tell of future events, your young¦83363 men will see visions¦83365, and your old men will have dreams¦83373 \add from God\add*.
\v 18 I will pour my \nd spirit¦83398\nd* out on my male and female slaves¦83381 and they¦83402 will tell of future events.
\v 19 I will do unusual things with the stars and planets, and also down on the earth¦83414 below¦83415: blood¦83416, fire¦83418, and clouds of smoke¦83421.
\v 20 I'll make the sun¦83423 go dark and the moon¦83431 go blood¦83433 red. This will happen before¦83434 the great¦83441 victorious day¦83438 of the coming of the \nd master¦83439\nd*.
\v 21 Then everyone¦83446 who relies on the name¦83452 and authority of the \nd master¦83454\nd* will be saved¦83455.’
\p
\v 22 “Fellow Israelis, listen¦83459 to this account: You yourselves¦83493 know that God did miracles¦83476 through \nd Yeshua¦83463\nd* from Nazareth¦83465, and he fulfilled signs¦83480 \add from the scriptures\add*—in fact God did this right in front of you.
\v 23 \x + \xo 2:23: \xt Mat 27:35; Mrk 15:24; Luk 23:33; Jn 19:18.\x*Then as part of God's plan and foreknowledge¦83500, this Yeshua was taken to the authorities by those who didn't follow their own laws, and you¦83510 all killed¦83510 him by having him executed¦83509 on a pole.
\v 24 \x + \xo 2:24: \xt Mat 28:5-6; Mrk 16:6; Luk 24:5.\x*But \nd God¦83514\nd* released him from the agonies¦83518 of death and brought him back to life—death couldn't restrain¦83526 him.
\v 25 \x + \xo 2:25-28: \xt Psa 16:8-11 (LXX).\x*As David¦83530 wrote,
\q1 ‘I foresaw¦83537 the \nd master¦83539\nd* always being in front of me. I refuse to be afraid because¦83545 he's there on my¦83548 right¦83547.
\q1
\v 26 Because¦83553 of that, I was happy and spoke out my¦83557 praises. My¦83557 whole body lives in anticipation
\v 27 because¦83575 you will never abandon¦83577 my¦83580 soul¦83579 in Hades¦83583, nor will you allow the godly¦83587 one to decay¦83590.
\v 28 You showed me the roads to life¦83595. You fill me with gladness¦83598 because of your¦83603 presence¦83602.’
\p
\v 29 “Fellow Israelis, we can tell you¦83611 all with confidence¦83609 that our patriarch¦83614 David¦83615 both died¦83618 and was buried¦83620, and his¦83625 tomb¦83624 is still here with us today.
\v 30 \x + \xo 2:30: \xt Psa 132:11; 2Sam 7:12-13.\x*So¦83635 because he was a prophet¦83634, and knowing¦83639 that \nd God¦83645\nd* has promised him to seat one of his descendants on his throne¦83664,
\v 31 he was foretelling the resurrection¦83671 of the \nd messiah¦83673\nd* who was neither¦83675 ‘abandoned¦83677 in Hades¦83684 nor did his¦83689 body decay¦83692.’
\v 32 Then \nd God¦83699\nd* raised¦83697 this \nd Yeshua¦83696\nd* back to life and we're all witnesses¦83705 of that.
\v 33 Now he's sitting at God's right¦83708 hand¦83708, and having received¦83722 the promise¦83716 of the holy \nd spirit¦83718\nd* from the father¦83725, he poured¦83726 this out which¦83728 you are all seeing¦83734 and hearing¦83736 \add today\add*.
\v 34 \x + \xo 2:34-35: \xt Psa 110:1.\x*You see, David¦83739 never went up to the heavens¦83743, but he himself¦83748 said,
\q1 ‘The master said to my master: Sit down at my right¦83758
\q1
\v 35 until¦83760 I defeat your¦83766 enemies¦83765.’
\p
\v 36 “So let all Israel know that this \nd Yeshua¦83795\nd* that you¦83797 executed¦83798 on a pole, \nd God¦83790\nd* made him¦83783 both the \nd master¦83781\nd* and¦83784 the \nd messiah¦83785\nd*.”
\rem /s1 The First Converts
\p
\v 37 When the people heard¦83804 that, they were deeply troubled and asked Peter and the other¦83824 missionaries, “What should we¦83828 do then, brothers¦83831?”
\p
\v 38 Peter responded, “Turn away \add from your sins\add* and each one of you needs¦83843 to be immersed¦83843 by the authority of \nd Yeshua¦83852\nd* the \nd messiah¦83853\nd*. Then your sins will be forgiven¦83855 and you all will receive¦83861 the gift¦83863 of the holy \nd spirit¦83866\nd*,
\v 39 because that promise¦83872 is to you all and your¦83877 children¦83875 and to their descendants—to anyone who will call out to the \nd master¦83888\nd*, our¦83891 \nd God¦83890\nd*.”
\p
\v 40 Then Peter shared further teaching with them and¦83899 encouraged them to save themselves out from this corrupt generation¦83906.
\v 41 Because of that, those who welcomed¦83915 his¦83919 teaching were immersed¦83920 and about¦83930 three¦83931 thousand¦83931 people were added¦83922 to their numbers that day¦83926.
\rem /s1 The Fellowship of the Believers
\v 42 They continued listening to the teaching¦83938 of the missionaries, and in building their relationships with each other, and in breaking¦83948 bread¦83950 and praying together.

\p
\v 43 They were serious in their learning about God, and the missionaries did many miracles and signs¦83965 of God's power in Yerusalem and all the people wanted to be right with God.
\v 44 \x + \xo 2:44: \xt Acts 4:32-35.\x*All those who did believe¦83985 were united in purpose¦83989 and¦83990 had shared use of many things.
\v 45 Some sold their properties¦83998 and possessions¦84003 and divided¦84007 them among the group so that everyone had everything they needed.
\v 46 Each day¦84021 they¦84040 \add worshipped\add* together at the temple¦84028 and also went to various homes to break¦84035 bread¦84039 together. They talked about Yeshua at their mealtimes without sophistication,
\v 47 praising¦84048 \nd God¦84050\nd* and being popular with the people¦84058, and every¦84065 day¦84066 the \nd master¦84061\nd* was adding¦84062 more that were being saved¦84064.

\p
\v 1 One afternoon around 3pm, Peter and Yohan¦84085 were going¦84086 to the prayer¦84098 meeting in the temple¦84089.
\v 2 Now there was a man¦84105 who had been lame from birth, and every¦84116 day¦84117 he was placed beside a door¦84120 into the temple—an entry named ‘Beautiful¦84125 Door’. From there he could beg from the people entering¦84132 the temple.
\v 3 He saw Peter and¦84146 Yohan¦84147 about to enter¦84150 into the temple¦84153, so he asked them for a donation,
\v 4 but Peter and Yohan¦84169, looking closely at him¦84166 said¦84172, “Look at us!”
\v 5 So the man grabbed onto them, expecting¦84182 to get given something¦84183 by them.
\v 6 But Peter said¦84189, “I don't¦84198 have any silver or gold¦84197, but I'll give you what I do have. With the authority of \nd Yeshua¦84210\nd* the \nd messiah¦84211\nd* from Nazareth¦84213, \add I command you\add* to walk¦84217.”
\v 7 Then Peter grabbed¦84219 the man by the right¦84222 hand¦84223 and pulled him upwards. Immediately the man's feet¦84234 and ankles¦84239 were strengthened¦84231
\v 8 and he jumped up and stood¦84243 and started walking and went into the temple¦84253 with them, walking and skipping and praising¦84258 \nd God¦84260\nd*.
\v 9 All the people¦84266 \add there\add* saw¦84262 him¦84267 walking¦84268 and¦84269 praising¦84270 \nd God¦84273\nd*,
\v 10 and recognising¦84274 that he was the man who usually sat \add outside\add* begging at the ‘Beautiful¦84292 Door’ of the temple¦84297, they were astonished and astounded at what had happened¦84307 to him.

\v 11 As the man clung onto Peter and Yohan¦84323, all the people¦84332 ran¦84325 to see them in Solomon's¦84346 Porch and they were really astounded¦84349.
\rem /s1 Peter Preaches in the Temple
\v 12 But when Peter saw \add the crowd\add*, he answered¦84356 their thoughts¦84373, “Fellow Israelis, why are you all puzzled about this, and why are you staring at us as if this man is walking¦84386 because of \em our\em* power¦84377 or closeness to God.”

\p
\v 17 So now, friends, I know that you did \add all\add* that in ignorance¦84506, just like your¦84513 leaders,
\v 18 but \add actually\add* \nd God¦84516\nd* was fulfilling¦84530 what he had had written by the prophets¦84524, that the \nd messiah¦84528\nd* should suffer¦84526.
\v 19 Because of that, \add you¦84541 all need to\add* repent¦84532 and¦84534 turn¦84536 back \add to God\add* so that your¦84541 sins¦84543 can be erased,

\v 21 \add For now\add* it¦84566 is appropriate¦84566 for heaven¦84567 to receive¦84569 him¦84589, until¦84570 the times¦84571 of restoration¦84573 of everything, which¦84575 \add again\add* \nd God¦84578\nd* has had written by the faithful prophets¦84590.
\v 22 \x + \xo 3:22: \xt Deu 18:15,18 (LXX).\x*Indeed¦84592 Moses said¦84594, ‘The \nd master¦84605\nd*, our¦84608 \nd God¦84607\nd* will raise up a prophet¦84601 for you that's like one of your¦84614 own brothers¦84612. You must listen to everything he says—whatever he tells you.

\p
\v 1 While Peter and Yohan were still talking¦84731 to the people, the chief¦84743 priests¦84743 and a temple¦84749 officer¦84747 and some people from the Sadducee sect approached¦84740 them
\v 2 because¦84758 they were very upset about what they had been teaching¦84760 the people¦84763, including preaching¦84766 that \nd Yeshua¦84770\nd* could give life to the dead¦84780.
\v 3 So they arrested¦84782 the two, and as it¦84796 was already¦84799 evening¦84798, they put them in jail¦84791 overnight.
\v 4 Despite this, many people who had heard¦84803 their message¦84805 trusted \add in Yeshua\add* and¦84807 the number¦84810 of \add families\add* who were believers¦84806 grew to around 5,000.
\p
\v 5 Then the next day¦84822, the religious leaders and the elders¦84835 and the religious teachers¦84839 gathered¦84825 together¦84825 in Yerusalem¦84842
\v 6 along with those descended¦84865 from high priests, including Annas¦84845 the current high priest¦84849 and Caiaphas¦84852 and Yohan¦84857 and Alexander¦84860.
\v 7 After \add having¦84868 Peter and Yohan brought in and\add* standing them in the middle, they¦84873 began to ask, “Under what authority did you¦84885 do this?”
\p
\v 8 Then Peter, having¦84888 been filled¦84888 with the holy \nd spirit¦84889\nd*, said¦84891 to them, “Rulers¦84894 of the people¦84896 and¦84897 elders¦84898,
\v 9 if we're being¦84904 questioned today¦84903 about a good¦84908 deed done to a man¦84909 who couldn't walk and which resulted in his healing,
\v 10 then you all need to know, and the people¦84925 of Israel should¦84918 also know, that it was done under the authority and name of \nd Yeshua¦84932\nd* the \nd messiah¦84933\nd*. He was the man from Nazareth¦84935 that you executed¦84938 on a pole, but who \nd God¦84941\nd* brought back to life. It was because of his authority that this man can now stand before¦84949 you without deformity.
\v 11 \x + \xo 4:11: \xt Psa 118:22.\x*This Yeshua is:
\q1 ‘the stone¦84955 which was rejected by you¦84960 builders¦84963,
\q1 has now become¦84966 the \add vital\add* cornerstone¦84969.’
\m
\v 12 We can't be saved by anyone¦84975 else, because¦84981 there's¦84985 no other¦84974 name¦84983 or authority that's been given¦84993 in the entire world under¦84988 which people¦84995 can be saved.
\p
\v 13 The assembled leaders were amazed¦85018 when they saw the boldness¦85007 of Peter and Yohan¦85009 who they knew to be illiterate¦85014, working-class men¦85013 Then they recognised¦85019 that they had been with \nd Yeshua¦85026\nd*,
\v 14 but since the man¦85031 who was no longer deformed was standing there with them, there was nothing¦85039 that they¦85040 could really accuse them of.
\v 15 So they had them removed from the room, and they asked each other,
\v 16 “What should we do with these¦85063 fellows? By now everyone in Yerusalem¦85077 has heard about the miracle they did, and we have no way to rebuff it¦85084.
\v 17 However, we have to stop it spreading¦85094 even further, so maybe we should ban them from speaking¦85108 about this name¦85111 to anyone¦85113.”
\v 18 So they called¦85122 them back in and decreed that they weren't allowed to preach or teach¦85133 under the name¦85136 of \nd Yeshua¦85138\nd* anymore.
\p
\v 19 But Peter and¦85143 Yohan¦85145 answered¦85146, “You judge \add for yourselves\add* whether¦85152 it's right¦85153 in God's eyes to listen to you¦85158 rather¦85160 than to him?
\v 20 As for us, we're not able to be silent about what we saw¦85171 and heard¦85174.”
\v 21 So after making some further¦85179 threats¦85179, the leaders sent¦85180 them off. They hadn't been able to find anything to punish¦85188 them for, because¦85200 the people¦85194 were all praising \nd God¦85199\nd* for what had happened
\v 22 \add and\add* because the man¦85210 who had miraculously recovered was over forty¦85207 years¦85203 old.

\v 23 After Peter and Yohan had been released, they went to their¦85224 own \add group\add* and told them what the chief¦85233 priests¦85233 and elders¦85236 had said¦85237.
\v 24 \x + \xo 4:24: \xt Exo 20:11; Neh 9:6; Psa 146:6.\x*When they all heard¦85241 this, they began to pray out loud to \nd God¦85253\nd*, saying, “Master¦85257, you¦85258 created heaven¦85264 and earth¦85267 and the sea¦85270, and everything in them.

\v 26 The earthly¦85306 kings¦85304 and rulers¦85309 stood and worked together¦85310 against the \nd master¦85316\nd* and against his¦85321 \nd messiah¦85320\nd*.’

\v 28 Then they did exactly what your¦85354 power and plan had already decided would happen.
\v 29 So now, \nd master¦85364\nd*, see their¦85370 threats¦85368 and¦85371 help us, your slaves¦85374, to be able to proclaim your message¦85382 with boldness¦85378.

\p
\v 31 As they finished their¦85411 requests, the place¦85414 where they had met was shaken¦85412 and all of them were filled¦85420 with the holy \nd spirit¦85427\nd*, and they \add went out and\add* boldly proclaimed God's message¦85431.

\v 32 \x + \xo 4:32: \xt Acts 2:44-45.\x*And so the group of believers¦85444 were united in their will and attitude. No one claimed anything¦85463 to be their own, but they shared everything they had.
\v 33 The missionaries of the \nd master¦85496\nd*, \nd Yeshua¦85497\nd*, experienced great power¦85482 and proclaimed the truth about how he came back to life, and \add God's\add* favour was with them.
\v 34 None of them were lacking anything, because¦85518 any of them who owned properties¦85521 or houses¦85524 would sell them and donate the proceeds.
\v 35 They would lay them down in front of the missionaries, and from there it¦85542 was distributed¦85542 around according to what needs each person had.

\rem /s1 Ananias and Sapphira
\p
\v 1 But in contrast, a couple named Ananias¦85593 and Sapphira¦85597 sold a property¦85603
\v 2 but agreed together to hide some of the proceeds. So Ananias brought¦85617 a smaller amount and put it¦85625 down in front of the missionaries.
\v 3 Then Peter said¦85627, “Ananias¦85633, why has Satan¦85641 filled¦85637 your¦85644 mind¦85643 such that you would lie to the holy \nd spirit¦85648\nd* and keep aside some of the proceeds of the property¦85659?
\v 4 Wasn't it yours before it was sold? And even when it was sold, the money was still yours. Why did you decide¦85676 to handle it like this? It wasn't people¦85688 that you're lying¦85687 to, but \nd God¦85691\nd*.”
\v 5 When Ananias¦85696 heard that, he fell down and stopped¦85702 breathing¦85702. Everyone who heard about it felt very afraid,
\v 6 and the young¦85715 men¦85715 there stood up and covered¦85716 his \add body\add*, carried it out, and buried¦85720 him.
\p
\v 7 Three hours¦85725 later, Ananias' wife¦85730 came in, not knowing¦85733 anything about¦85724 what had happened.
\v 8 Peter checked, “Is it true that you¦85755 guys sold the property¦85753 for such-and-such an amount?”
\p “Yes, for that amount,” she¦85756 replied.
\p
\v 9 But Peter said¦85764 to her, “Why did the two of you agree¦85771 to test the \nd spirit¦85776\nd* of the \nd master¦85778\nd*? The guys who just buried¦85783 your¦85786 husband¦85785 are just out the door¦85790, and they'll carry you out as well.”
\v 10 Sapphira immediately¦85798 fell down in front of him¦85803 and stopped¦85805 breathing¦85805. Then the young¦85809 men¦85809 came in and found¦85810 her dead¦85813, so they took \add her body out\add* and buried¦85819 her with her husband¦85822.
\v 11 So the entire¦85829 assembly¦85831 of believers became¦85825 very afraid, along with every else who heard about these¦85838 events.

\v 12 The missionaries went on to do many miracles and amazing things, and all the people¦85855 who gathered in Solomon's¦85869 Porch had a united vision,

\v 15 Some would even bring¦85904 those who were sick¦85906 out to the side of the road, lying them on beds and mats waiting for Peter to come past so that \add even\add* his shadow¦85921 might touch them.
\v 16 More crowds were coming¦85936 from the towns around Yerusalem¦85947, bringing¦85948 those who were sick¦85949 and those tormented¦85951 by demons¦85955, and they were all getting healed¦85958.

\v 17 But the chief¦85965 priest¦85965 and his colleagues who were members of the sect of Sadducees¦85975 were filled¦85976 with jealousy¦85977 and took action
\v 18 by having the missionaries arrested¦85980 and thrown into the public¦85993 jail¦85992.
\v 19 But one of the \nd master's¦86004\nd* messengers¦86001 opened¦86010 the prison¦86016 doors¦86014 during the night¦86007 and¦86019 led them out again, saying,
\v 20 “Now go and stand in the temple¦86028 and keep telling the people¦86030 all the teaching about \add new\add* life¦86035.”
\v 21 So at dawn, having taken notice of the messenger, they went into the temple¦86045 and started teaching¦86047 \add the people there again\add*.
\p When the chief¦86052 priest¦86052 arrived¦86048 with his companions, they called together¦86061 the \add religious\add* council and also the \add political\add* council of Israel, then called for the missionaries to be brought¦86077 in from the prison¦86076.
\v 22 But when their attendants¦86087 got to the jail, they weren't there, so they returned¦86095 to the gathering and told them,
\v 23 “We found the prison¦86104 all locked up with the guards¦86113 in their positions at the doors¦86119, but¦86121 when they opened¦86120 it up, there was no one inside¦86122!”
\v 24 When they¦86127 heard¦86127 this, the officer¦86136 of the temple¦86138 and¦86139 the chief¦86141 priests¦86141 were totally puzzled as to what could have happened.
\v 25 Just then someone¦86153 came in and¦86171 told them, “Hey, the men¦86160 that you¦86162 put in prison¦86165 are in the temple¦86169—standing there teaching¦86172 the people¦86174.”
\v 26 So the temple officer¦86178 took the attendants¦86181 and went and got them, but didn't use force¦86188 because¦86191 they were afraid that the people¦86193 might start throwing rocks at them.
\p
\v 27 So they¦86201 brought¦86198 them in and stood them in front of the council¦86204, where the chief¦86210 priest¦86210 addressed them,
\v 28 \x + \xo 5:28: \xt Mat 27:25.\x*“We officially commanded¦86214 you all not to be teaching in this name¦86221 and authority. But see¦86224 here, now you have filled¦86225 Yerusalem¦86228 with your¦86231 teaching, and what's more, you're blaming us for the death of that man¦86240.”
\v 29 But Peter and¦86247 the other missionaries answered¦86243, “It's better to obey \nd God¦86255\nd* than people¦86258.
\v 30 The \nd god¦86267\nd* of our¦86270 ancestors¦86269 brought \nd Yeshua¦86272\nd* back to life after you¦86274 all handed¦86275 him over to be hung up on a pole.
\v 31 But \nd God¦86281\nd* honoured this way-maker and saviour¦86284 by placing him¦86289 in the place of honour, to \add encourage\add* Israel to repent¦86292 and \add then\add* to forgive¦86296 their sins¦86297.
\v 32 We are witnesses¦86306 of these¦86311 messages¦86310, along with the holy \nd spirit¦86314\nd* who \nd God¦86322\nd* gave¦86320 to the ones who obey him¦86325.”
\p
\v 33 When the gathered councils heard¦86328 this, they were enraged and wanted to kill¦86334 them,
\v 34 but a certain¦86338 member¦86345 of the Pharisee¦86345 party¦86345 named Gamaliel¦86347 stood up in the council¦86343 chamber. He was a law teacher¦86348 respected by all the community, and he ordered the \add guards\add* to take them outside¦86356 for a while,
\v 35 then he said¦86364, “Fellow Israelis, think carefully about what you're planning to do with these¦86384 men¦86383.
\v 36 A while back, a man called Theudas¦86395 became¦86428 prominent, saying¦86396 that he was someone¦86398 important. Eventually about¦86411 four¦86413 hundred¦86413 others joined¦86405 him, but he was killed¦86416 and those who had followed him were dispersed¦86426 and it all came to nothing¦86430.
\v 37 A bit later on, a Galilean¦86436 man named Yudas became prominent at the time of the census and he attracted people¦86444 to him. But he also died, and all those who'd been persuaded¦86457 by him ended up being¦86457 scattered¦86459.
\v 38 So here's my advice to you¦86466 all: pull back from \add killing\add* these¦86471 men¦86470 and allow¦86473 them \add to continue\add*, because¦86480 if this teaching and goings on is man-made, it'll be overthrown,
\v 39 but if it's from God, you all won't be able to bring them down in case you find yourselves opposing God.”
\p So they were persuaded¦86522 by Gamaliel,
\v 40 and after calling¦86526 in the missionaries and having them beaten, they commanded¦86530 them not to speak¦86534 using the name¦86538 and authority of \nd Yeshua¦86540\nd* and then sent¦86542 them out.
\v 41 So¦86546 the missionaries left the councils¦86553, very excited that they were considered¦86555 worthy¦86555 to be disgraced because¦86556 of Yeshua.
\v 42 After that, they¦86575 never stopped teaching¦86576 and preaching¦86578 the good¦86578 message¦86578 about \nd Yeshua¦86583\nd* the \nd messiah¦86582\nd* in the temple¦86570 and in various homes.

\v 1 However around that time when the number of Yeshua-followers were growing, some of the Greek converts starting grumbling¦86595 about the Jewish believers because¦86601 the Greek widows¦86610 were being¦86602 overlooked¦86602 in the daily¦86608 sharing \add of food and money\add*.
\v 2 So the twelve¦86620 \add missionaries\add* assembled the believers together and told them, “We're not pleased¦86630 about having to take time off \add sharing\add* the message¦86637 of \nd God¦86639\nd* to be serving¦86640 here at the \add distribution\add* tables¦86641.
\v 3 So brothers¦86649, look around you¦86653 for seven¦86657 men¦86651 who're well known to be full of \add God's\add* \nd spirit¦86659\nd* and¦86661 wisdom¦86662, so we¦86664 can appoint¦86664 them to be in charge of this part of the work.
\v 4 Then we¦86671 \add ourselves\add* can continue to pray and¦86676 share the message¦86680.”
\p
\v 5 This idea pleased¦86684 the group, so they¦86696 went ahead and chose¦86696 Stephen (a man¦86700 full of faith¦86703 and of the holy \nd spirit¦86706\nd*), Philip, Procorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas¦86718, and Nicolas (a non-Jew from Antioch¦86723 who had previously converted¦86722 to Judaism).
\v 6 They stood¦86727 these seven up in front of the missionaries, who prayed¦86735 and¦86733 then placed their¦86738 hands¦86739 on them.
\p
\v 7 God's message¦86742 continued spreading and the number of followers in Yerusalem¦86754 was rapidly increasing, and a large number of the priests¦86760 became believers.

\v 10 but they weren't able to refute the wisdom¦86820 that he spoke \add with the help of\add* the pure \nd spirit¦86827\nd*.
\v 11 So they¦86848 got some men¦86849 \add to falsely accuse Stephen\add* saying¦86850, “We heard¦86853 him¦86854 denigrating Moses and¦86862 \nd God¦86864\nd*.”
\v 12 So they stirred¦86865 up the people¦86868 and the elders¦86871 and the law teachers¦86874 and so they approached¦86876 \add Stephen\add* and arrested him and brought¦86881 him to the council¦86885 \add chambers\add*.
\v 13 There they¦86887 produced the false¦86890 witnesses¦86889 saying¦86893, “This man¦86897 won't stop spreading messages¦86904 against this holy \add temple\add* and against the law
\v 14 because we¦86915 heard¦86915 him¦86917 saying¦86918 that that \nd Yeshua¦86920\nd* from Nazareth¦86922 will be tearing¦86924 down this building and¦86928 will be changing¦86929 the traditions that Moses¦86936 gave¦86934 to us.”
\v 15 So then the council¦86951 members looked¦86938 across at Stephen and saw that his¦86957 face \add was shining\add* like that of one \add of God's\add* messengers¦86960.

\v 1 Then the chief¦86968 priest¦86968 asked \add Stephen\add*, “Is all this true?”
\p
\v 2 \x + \xo 7:2-3: \xt Gen 12:1.\x*And he replied, “My brothers¦86982 and fathers¦86984, please listen¦86985. Our¦86993 honoured \nd God¦86987\nd* was seen¦86990 by our¦86993 ancestor Abraham¦86994 in Mesopotamia¦86998 before¦86999 he moved to Haran
\v 3 and he told him, ‘Leave your land and your relatives¦87018, and go to the place that I will show you.’
\v 4 \x + \xo 7:4: a \xt Gen 11:31; \xo b \xt Gen 12:4.\x*So he left Chaldea and moved to Haran, and then after¦87043 his¦87048 father¦87047 died, he moved again to this land where we now live.
\v 5 \x + \xo 7:5: \xt Gen 12:7; 13:15; 15:18; 17:8.\x*Abraham hadn't received any land here as an inheritance¦87072, in fact he'd never been near this land and nor did he have any children¦87099, yet God promised¦87080 to give¦87082 this \add entire\add* country to him and his¦87092 descendants¦87091.
\v 6 \x + \xo 7:6-7: \xt Gen 15:13-14.\x*And yet \nd God¦87105\nd* \add also\add* told him¦87113 that his¦87113 descendants¦87111 would end up staying in another¦87117 country where they would be enslaved¦87119 and mistreated¦87123 for four¦87126 hundred¦87126 years¦87125.
\v 7 \x + \xo 7:7: \xt Exo 3:12.\x*However \nd God¦87140\nd* promised to punish the nation¦87130 that enslaved them, and told him that in the end they would leave that place¦87152 and serve¦87134 him here in this country.
\v 8 \x + \xo 7:8: a \xt Gen 17:10-14; \xo b \xt Gen 21:2-4; \xo c \xt Gen 25:26; \xo d \xt Gen 29:31–35:18.\x*And he contracted with Abraham about being circumcised, and so when Abraham had Isaac, he circumcised him on the eighth¦87171 day¦87168, and then Isaac went on to have Yacob, and Yacob to have the \add twelve\add* tribal leaders.
\p
\v 9 \x + \xo 7:9: a \xt Gen 37:11; \xo b \xt Gen 37:28; \xo c \xt Gen 39:2,21.\x*Those brothers went on to become jealous¦87186 of Yosef and sent him back into Egypt¦87191 \add as a slave\add*, but \nd God¦87195\nd* was with him
\v 10 \x + \xo 7:10: \xt Gen 41:39-41.\x*and rescued¦87199 him out of all his¦87206 troubles there. Then God gave¦87208 him wisdom¦87213 and caused him to gain the favour¦87210 of Pharaoh, the king¦87217 of Egypt, who then appointed¦87220 him as the ruler of all Egypt and over Pharaoh's own household¦87229.
\v 11 \x + \xo 7:11: \xt Gen 42:1-2.\x*Then a famine¦87234 hit all Egypt¦87242 and Canaan causing great¦87247 distress and our¦87255 ancestors¦87254 were unable to find enough food.
\v 12 But Yacob¦87259 heard¦87256 that grain¦87261 was available in Egypt¦87265, so first¦87274, he sent¦87267 off our¦87273 tribal leaders.
\v 13 \x + \xo 7:13: a \xt Gen 45:1; \xo b \xt Gen 45:16.\x*On their second¦87279 visit, Yosef revealed himself to them, and¦87286 so Pharaoh became¦87288 aware of Yosef's heritage.
\v 14 \x + \xo 7:14: a \xt Gen 45:9-10,17-18; \xo b \xt Gen 46:27 (LXX).\x*Then Yosef sent¦87297 for his¦87304 father¦87303 Yacob¦87301 and¦87306 all the extended family—some seventy-five¦87313 of them.
\v 15 \x + \xo 7:15: a \xt Gen 46:1-7; \xo b \xt Gen 49:33.\x*So Yacob¦87320 went to Egypt¦87322, where he and the \add twelve\add* tribal leaders eventually died¦87324,
\v 16 \x + \xo 7:16: \xt Gen 23:3-16; 33:19; 50:7-13; Josh 24:32.\x*although their bodies were moved to Shechem where they were put into the tomb¦87340 that Abraham¦87344 had bought from the sons¦87349 of Hamor.
\p
\v 17 \x + \xo 7:17-18: \xt Exo 1:7-8.\x*But as the time¦87361 limit promised¦87366 to Abraham¦87371 by \nd God¦87369\nd* was getting closer, \add our\add* people¦87374 multiplied¦87376 in Egypt¦87378
\v 18 until¦87379 another¦87383 Pharaoh ended up ruling there who had never known¦87389 Yosef.
\v 19 \x + \xo 7:19: a \xt Exo 1:10-11; \xo b \xt Exo 1:22.\x*He took advantage¦87396 of us Jews and mistreated¦87400 our¦87399 ancestors¦87402, even forcing them apart from their¦87410 own babies¦87408 so they wouldn't live.
\v 20 \x + \xo 7:20: \xt Exo 2:2.\x*Moses was born during that time¦87417 and¦87421 \nd God¦87425\nd* considered him beautiful¦87423. He spent three¦87429 months¦87428 in his \add own\add* father's¦87434 house¦87432
\v 21 \x + \xo 7:21: \xt Exo 2:3-10.\x*before being placed outside, from where Pharaoh's¦87450 daughter¦87449 took¦87445 him and brought¦87452 him up herself¦87455 as her own son.
\v 22 So Moses was instructed¦87459 in all the wisdom¦87465 of the Egyptians, and was a powerful¦87471 speaker and project leader.
\p
\v 23 \x + \xo 7:23-29: \xt Exo 2:11-15.\x*But when he hit forty¦87484, it entered his mind¦87489 to visit¦87491 his relatives, the Israelis.
\v 24 When he noticed one of them being mistreated, he retaliated¦87505 and while defending the oppressed man, he struck¦87512 \add and killed\add* the Egyptian.
\v 25 He thought his¦87533 relatives would understand¦87524 that \nd God¦87530\nd* was bringing salvation¦87536 to them via him¦87533, but¦87540 they¦87538 didn't see it that way.
\v 26 So on the following¦87546 day¦87547 when he saw two of them quarrelling¦87550, he tried to resolve the situation by saying, ‘Men, you're all brothers¦87567. Why are you injuring¦87572 each other?’
\v 27 But the bullying one pushed¦87580 him¦87581 away and¦87588 said¦87582, ‘Who made you¦87585 the judge¦87589 over us?
\v 28 Do you want to kill¦87594 me like you killed¦87600 that Egyptian yesterday¦87601?’
\v 29 \x + \xo 7:29: \xt Exo 18:3-4.\x*When he heard that, Moses fled \add Egypt\add* and became¦87617 an exile in Midian where¦87622 he \add eventually\add* had two¦87625 sons¦87624.
\p
\v 30 \x + \xo 7:30-34: \xt Exo 3:1-10.\x*After another forty¦87634 years¦87632, he was in the wilderness¦87639 around Mount¦87641 Sinai when he saw a messenger¦87644 in the flame¦87647 of a burning thorn¦87651 bush.
\v 31 Moses was amazed at the vision¦87659 when he saw it, so he approached¦87661 \add the bush\add* to look more closely when he heard Yahweh's voice¦87667 saying,
\v 32 ‘I am the god of your¦87681 ancestors¦87680—the god of Abraham¦87684 and of Isaac¦87688 and of Yacob¦87692.’ At that point, Moses started trembling¦87693 and was scared to go any closer to look,
\v 33 but \nd Yahweh¦87712\nd* said¦87704, ‘Take off your¦87721 sandals¦87716, because¦87723 the ground¦87732 you're standing on is dedicated to God.
\v 34 I have noticed the mistreatment¦87740 of my¦87743 people¦87742 in Egypt and heard¦87752 their¦87750 groaning¦87749 and so I came¦87755 down to rescue¦87756 them, so now I'm going to send¦87761 you¦87763 \add back\add* to Egypt.’
\p
\v 35 \x + \xo 7:35: \xt Exo 2:14.\x*This was the same Moses that they had previously rejected and asked who had made him ruler and judge¦87777 over them. Now \nd God¦87782\nd* had indeed sent him as ruler and liberator by means of the messenger¦87794 that he saw in the thorn¦87800 bush.
\v 36 \x + \xo 7:36: a \xt Exo 7:3; \xo b \xt Exo 14:21; \xo c \xt Num 14:33.\x*So eventually Moses led them out of Egypt¦87812 after doing miracles and signs¦87808 of God's power there, and then also at the Red Sea and during the forty years¦87822 in the wilderness¦87821.
\v 37 \x + \xo 7:37: \xt Deu 18:15,18.\x*This same Moses told Israelis that in the future \nd God¦87839\nd* would raise up another prophet¦87834 like him from among them.
\v 38 \x + \xo 7:38: \xt Exo 19:1–20:17; Deu 5:1-33.\x*Now Moses was the person that \add led\add* the assembly¦87858 \add of people\add* in the wilderness¦87861, was spoken to by one \add of God's\add* messengers¦87864 on Mt. Sinai, and¦87872 one of our¦87876 ancestors¦87874 that received¦87879 living¦87882 messages to pass on to us.
\p
\v 39 “Yet our¦87894 ancestors¦87893 didn't want to obey that man, so they rejected him and started thinking about Egypt¦87910 again,
\v 40 \x + \xo 7:40: \xt Exo 32:1.\x*saying to Aaron, ‘Make some gods¦87917 for us to lead us because¦87916 we've got no idea what happened to that Moses who led us out of Egypt¦87932.’
\v 41 \x + \xo 7:41: \xt Exo 32:2-6.\x*So together they made a calf as an idol¦87950 to bring sacrifices¦87948 to, and they were pleased with what they'd achieved.
\v 42 \x + \xo 7:42-43: \xt Amos 5:25-27 (LXX).\x*But \nd God¦87963\nd* turned¦87959 and allowed them to serve the heavenly¦87971 armies, just as the prophets¦87977 wrote¦87973,
\q1 ‘It wasn't me that you Israelis sacrificed¦87981 to for those forty years¦87984 in the wilderness¦87988.
\q1
\v 43 You turned to Molech's tent and Rephan's star¦88003 as your¦88006 gods by making images¦88010 of them to bow down to. So for that, I'll send you all away into exile beyond¦88022 Babylon¦88023.’
\p
\v 44 \x + \xo 7:44: \xt Exo 25:9,40.\x*The tent of evidence was with our¦88033 ancestors¦88031 in the wilderness¦88036—made to the pattern¦88050 that God had shown Moses.
\v 45 \x + \xo 7:45: \xt Josh 3:14-17.\x*Our¦88060 ancestors¦88059 then carried that tent into the land, having¦88057 inherited¦88057 it along with Joshua from the possession¦88066 of the pagans which¦88054 \nd God¦88073\nd* drove¦88070 out ahead of them. The tent remained there until¦88080 the time of David¦88083
\v 46 \x + \xo 7:46: \xt 2Sam 7:1-16; 1Ch 17:1-14.\x*who found¦88085 favour¦88086 with \nd God¦88089\nd* and¦88090 requested¦88091 to find a tent for the house¦88096 of Yacob¦88098,
\v 47 \x + \xo 7:47: \xt 1Ki 6:1-38; 2Ch 3:1-17.\x*but it was Solomon¦88099 who built¦88103 the house¦88106 for God \add to reside in\add*.
\p
\v 48 However the highest¦88111 one doesn't actually live in structures made by people, but as the prophet¦88121 wrote,
\q1
\v 49 \x + \xo 7:49-50: \xt Isa 66:1-2.\x*‘Heaven is my throne¦88128,
\q1 and¦88131 the earth¦88132 is where I place¦88146 my feet¦88135.
\q1 How could you¦88139 possibly build¦88139 a suitable house¦88138 for me?
\q1
\v 50 Wasn't it me that created everything?’
\p
\v 51 \x + \xo 7:51: \xt Isa 63:10.\x*You stiff-necked people with uncircumcised¦88161 hearts¦88166 and ears¦88170! You're always¦88172 opposing¦88177 the holy \nd spirit¦88174\nd* just like your¦88182 ancestors¦88181 were.
\v 52 Which¦88186 one of the prophets¦88188 wasn't persecuted¦88190 by your¦88194 ancestors¦88193? Even the ones that foretold¦88199 the coming of the righteous¦88205 one were killed¦88196 off by them in just the same way that you yourselves became¦88213 his betrayers¦88209 and murderers¦88211!
\v 53 You had received¦88215 the law under the direction of messengers¦88220, and¦88221 yet you didn't obey it¦88223.”

\p
\v 54 When they heard that, they were raging inside and grating¦88235 their¦88237 teeth¦88238 at him¦88240.
\v 55 But being¦88241 full of the holy \nd spirit¦88246\nd*, Stephen stared up into the sky and¦88255 was able to see God's splendor, as well as seeing \nd Yeshua¦88256\nd* standing there on God's right¦88261.
\v 56 He said¦88267, “I can look through the sky that's opened¦88272 up and can see humanity's child standing at God's right¦88281 side.”
\p
\v 57 At this point, they blocked their¦88292 ears¦88291 and rushed¦88294 together to grab Stephen, yelling loudly¦88288.
\v 58 They drove him out of the city¦88303 and then started throwing¦88299 rocks at him. His accusers left their¦88313 cloaks in charge of a young¦88318 man¦88318 named¦88320 Saul.
\v 59 As Stephen was being hit by the rocks, he called out, “\nd Master¦88330 Yeshua¦88332\nd*, receive¦88334 my¦88337 spirit¦88336.”
\v 60 Then falling to his knees¦88341, just before he died he called out loudly¦88345, “\nd Master¦88348\nd*, don't¦88349 hold this sin¦88356 against them.”

\v 4 However, now the people who had fled began to proclaim the good message to others in other places.
\v 5 Around the same time, Philip went to a city¦88454 in Samaria¦88457 and told them about the \nd messiah¦88461\nd*.
\v 6 Crowds gathered and listened carefully to Philip and watched him do miracles—
\v 7 many demon-possessed¦88498 people shouted¦88499 loudly¦88502 as the demons¦88498 left them, and many who were paralysed¦88507 or lame were healed¦88510

\s1 Simon the magician seeks power
\rem /s1 Simon the Sorcerer
\p
\v 9 One man¦88524 in the city¦88533 had been practicing¦88534 magic¦88534 and amazing¦88536 the people¦88540, and he claimed that he was someone¦88545 great¦88547. His name¦88527 was Simon¦88528
\v 10 and the people there from the least to the most important said, “This power is from the great \nd god¦88562\nd*.”
\v 11 They gave him¦88568 a lot of attention because¦88569 he'd been amazing them with magic¦88574 for quite a long time¦88572.
\v 12 However when Philip started preaching¦88584 the good message about God's kingdom¦88589 and the name and authority of \nd Yeshua¦88597\nd* the \nd messiah¦88598\nd*, they believed¦88579 the message, and many men and women¦88603 asked to be immersed¦88599 \add in water\add*.
\v 13 Simon¦88606 himself¦88608 also believed¦88609 and was immersed¦88611, and then started accompanying Philip around—marvelling¦88628 as he observed¦88617 the miracles¦88623 and signs¦88621 of God's power.
\p
\v 14 When the missionaries in Yerusalem¦88634 heard¦88630 that many people from Samaria¦88640 had accepted God's message¦88642, they¦88646 sent¦88646 Peter and¦88651 Yohan¦88652 out to them
\v 15 so then they prayed¦88655 for them to receive¦88659 the holy \nd spirit¦88660\nd*.
\v 16 (The holy spirit hadn't fallen¦88670 on any of them at that point, but¦88672 they¦88674 had only been immersed¦88673 into the name¦88677 and authority of the \nd master¦88680 Yeshua¦88681\nd*.)
\v 17 So Peter and Yohan placed their¦88687 hands¦88688 on the new believers and they received¦88692 the holy \nd spirit¦88693\nd*.
\p
\v 18 When Simon¦88699 the magician saw that they received the \nd spirit¦88710\nd* after having¦88695 the hands¦88705 of the missionaries placed on them, he offered¦88713 money¦88716 to Peter and Yohan, saying,
\v 19 “Give me this authority¦88723 so that anyone who I place \em my\em* hands¦88732 on will receive¦88733 the holy \nd spirit¦88734\nd*.”
\p
\v 20 But Peter responded, “May your money¦88759 join you in your destruction¦88750 because¦88751 you thought¦88756 you could buy God's gift¦88753 with it¦88748.
\v 21 There's¦88763 no role for you here and no part for you in our work because your¦88775 heart¦88774 isn't right¦88778 with \nd God¦88783\nd*.
\v 22 You need to turn away from this evil¦88788 \add desire\add* and beg the \nd master¦88795\nd* that maybe he'll forgive¦88799 you for your¦88790 wrong intentions¦88803
\v 23 because I perceive that you¦88819 have a bitter¦88811 attitude and¦88813 ungodly habits.
\p
\v 24 Simon¦88824 answered¦88821, “Oh, please ask the \nd master¦88838\nd* on my behalf that none of what you¦88852 mentioned will happen to me.”

\v 25 After that, Peter and Yohan continued to testify¦88862 and proclaim the good message¦88867 about the \nd master¦88870\nd* in many villages¦88879 around Samaria¦88881 before they returned¦88872 to Yerusalem¦88875.

\v 26 Then a messenger¦88884 from the \nd master¦88886\nd* spoke¦88887 to Philip, “Start walking and head south¦88897 on the road that goes downhill from Yerusalem¦88905 to Gaza through the wilderness¦88910.”
\v 27 So he headed off, and \add on the road\add* he came across an important official¦88919 of the Ethiopian queen\f + \fr 8:27 \ft Some translations list the queen's name as ‘Candace’, but that was the name of the series of queens, cf., Pharaoh or Caesar which came to be used as a title for more than one person.\f* who was in charge of her¦88931 treasury¦88930.

\v 28 and was returning¦88942 home in his¦88948 chariot¦88947. As he rode, he was reading¦88950 \add the scroll of\add* the prophet¦88956 Isayah¦88957,
\v 29 and the \nd spirit¦88961\nd* told Philip to approach him and stay by the chariot¦88968.
\v 30 So Philip ran up to the chariot and heard¦88975 the man reading from the prophet¦88980 Isayah¦88978 and asked, “Do you know what it is that you're¦88988 reading about?”
\p
\v 31 “How could I know when I don't¦89000 have someone¦89001 to guide me,” he answered, and so he invited Philip to climb up and sit¦89011 with him.

\q1 ‘He was led away like a sheep¦89025 being led to the slaughterhouse¦89027,
\q1 and stayed as silent¦89039 as a lamb being shorn
\q2 so he never opened his¦89045 mouth¦89044.
\q1
\v 33 He was humiliated¦89048 by a lack of justice¦89051.
\q1 Who can name his descendants,
\q2 because his life¦89066 is being¦89061 taken from the earth¦89064?’
\p
\v 34 “Now tell me,” said¦89074 the official, “who was Isayah talking about? Was he talking about himself¦89084 or someone¦89088 else?”
\v 35 So Philip started with that passage and explained the good¦89103 message¦89103 about \nd Yeshua¦89106\nd* to him.
\v 36 As they were going¦89109 along¦89110 the road¦89112, they came to some water, and the official asked, “Look¦89121, here's some water. What would stop me from being immersed¦89126 here?”
\p
\v 37 ≈
\v 38 So he commanded¦89151 \add the driver\add* to stop the chariot¦89154 and they both climbed down, and Philip immersed¦89168 the official in the water¦89160.
\v 39 But as they came out of the water¦89175, the \nd master's¦89184 spirit¦89176\nd* snatched¦89185 Philip away and so the official never saw¦89190 him again, but he continued on his¦89200 journey very happy.
\v 40 As for Philip, he found¦89204 himself at \add the town of\add* Azotus, and as he passed through¦89208 \add the coastal towns\add* on the way to Caesarea¦89219, he proclaimed the good¦89209 message¦89209 in each town.

\p
\v 1 Meanwhile Saul was still¦89224 spouting off murderous¦89228 threats¦89226 towards¦89229 the followers of the \nd master¦89233\nd*. He went to the chief¦89236 priest¦89236
\v 2 and obtained \add official\add* letters¦89241 to enable him to enter the Jewish¦89247 meeting¦89247 halls¦89247 in Damascus¦89243 so that if he found either male or female followers of Yeshua, he could arrest them and bring¦89262 them to Yerusalem¦89264 in chains.
\p
\v 3 On his journey as he approached Damascus¦89273, suddenly¦89275 light¦89280 from the sky¦89285 flashed¦89279 around¦89279 him.
\v 4 He dropped to his knees\f + \fr 9:4 \ft It seems most likely that Paul and company were walking to Damascus (and not on horseback despite paintings by Caravaggio and others). The journey of somewhere around 300km would have taken around two weeks.\f* and heard¦89291 a voice¦89292 calling, “Saul, Saul, why are you¦89299 persecuting¦89299 me?”
\p
\v 5 “Who are you, master¦89305?” he¦89300 asked.
\p And the voice replied, “I'm \nd Yeshua¦89312\nd*, the one that you're¦89316 persecuting¦89317.
\v 6 Now, stand up and go into the city¦89345, and you'll be told there what you need to do.”
\p
\v 7 Meanwhile his travelling¦89358 companions had stood¦89360 there speechless¦89361, because they had heard the voice¦89365 but couldn't see anyone¦89363.
\v 8 They helped Saul¦89373 up from the ground¦89376, but even when he opened¦89377 his¦89384 eyes¦89383, he couldn't see anything. So they had to lead him into Damascus¦89393 by hand¦89388.
\v 9 Saul stayed there for three¦89397 days¦89396, unable to see and¦89400 not eating or drinking anything.
\s1 Ananias restores Saul's sight
\p
\v 10 Now there was a believer there in Damascus¦89412 named Ananias, and the master spoke to him in a vision¦89422, calling, “Ananias.”
\p “I'm here, master,” he answered.
\p
\v 11 So the \nd master¦89434\nd* told him¦89436, “Get up and¦89446 go to Yudas' house¦89449 in Straight¦89445 Street where you'll find a man named Saul from Tarsus¦89453. He's praying¦89456 right now
\v 12 and in his vision¦89461, he saw¦89458 a man¦89459 named Ananias¦89464 who comes in and places his hands¦89472 on him so that he can receive¦89474 his sight¦89474 back.”
\p
\v 13 But Ananias¦89478 resisted, “\nd Master¦89479\nd*, I've heard¦89481 a lot about that man¦89486, including all the evil¦89489 things he's done to your¦89493 dedicated people in Yerusalem¦89496,
\v 14 and¦89498 the reason he's here in Damascus with the authority¦89501 of the chief¦89504 priests¦89504 is to arrest everyone who trusts in you¦89511.”
\p
\v 15 But the \nd master¦89517\nd* said¦89512, “Go now, because¦89519 I have chosen that man¦89525 to be a bearer of my¦89530 name¦89529 and authority both in other countries, even to their kings¦89536, and to the descendants of Israel,
\v 16 because I'll be showing¦89542 him what he's going to have to suffer¦89551 for bearing my¦89550 name¦89549.”
\p
\v 17 So Ananias¦89555 left and went¦89552 into Yudas' house¦89560 where he placed his hands¦89566 on Saul and said¦89569, “Brother Saul, the \nd master¦89573\nd* has sent¦89574 me here—\nd Yeshua¦89576\nd* the one you saw on the road¦89582 when you were coming¦89584 here—so that you will be able to see again and also be filled¦89589 with the holy \nd spirit¦89590\nd*.”
\v 18 Immediately something¦89594 like scales¦89603 fell off Saul's eyes¦89599 and he was able to see again, and he got up¦89610 and got immersed¦89612 in water,
\v 19 before getting something to eat to renew his strength¦89617.

\p Then Saul stayed several days¦89627 with the believers in Damascus¦89625.
\v 20 He went straight into the Jewish¦89634 meeting¦89634 halls¦89634 and started proclaiming¦89635 that \nd Yeshua¦89637\nd* is God's son.
\p
\v 21 The hearers were all amazed¦89646, saying¦89654, “Isn't this the guy that persecuted¦89659 the ones following that Yeshua in Yerusalem¦89662, and even came to Damascus to arrest them here and take them back to the chief¦89682 priests¦89682?”
\p
\v 22 But Saul was growing stronger\f + \fr 9:22 \ft It's not clear here whether it means that Saul was growing physically stronger, or that his preaching and debating skills were improving.\f* and he was confounding¦89690 the Jews¦89692 living¦89694 in Damascus¦89696 as he taught¦89697 them that Yeshua is the \add promised\add* \nd messiah¦89702\nd*.

\rem /s1 Saul in Jerusalem
\p
\v 26 When he got back to Yerusalem¦89762, Saul attempted¦89764 to join in with the believers there but they were all scared of him, not believing¦89774 that he was a true follower of Yeshua.
\v 27 However Barnabas¦89778 took Saul and brought¦89782 him to the twelve, and Saul told them how he had seen the \nd master¦89795\nd* on the road¦89792, and been spoken to by him, and how he had spoken boldly¦89804 in Damascus¦89803 in the name¦89807 and authority of \nd Yeshua¦89809\nd*.
\v 28 So Saul stayed connected with the believers, going¦89817 in and out of Yerusalem¦89820 and speaking¦89823 boldly¦89823 in the name¦89826 and authority of the \nd master¦89828\nd*.
\v 29 He also talked and¦89832 debated¦89833 with the Greek-speaking Jews, but¦89840 they¦89839 wanted to kill¦89843 him¦89844,
\v 30 so when the brothers¦89849 found out, they took Saul down to Caesarea¦89854 \add on the coast\add*, and from there sent¦89856 him \add on a ship\add* to Tarsus¦89860.
\p
\v 31 After that the assemblies¦89866\f + \fr 9:31 \ft Lit. ‘assembly’ (singular).

\rem /s1 Peter in Lydda and Joppa
\p
\v 36 Then in Yoppa¦89971 there was a believer named Tabitha¦89977 (or Dorcas if translated) and¦89988 she¦89991 did a lot of good¦89987 things as well as being generous to the poor.
\v 37 Around that time she¦89999 got sick and died. After washing her¦90003 body, they¦90004 placed it¦89992 in an upper¦90008 room,
\v 38 and since Yoppa¦90016 was near Lydda¦90012 and the believers had heard¦90019 that Peter was there, they¦90025 quickly sent¦90025 two¦90026 men¦90027 to request, “Please come as soon as possible.”
\v 39 So Peter went with them, and when they arrived¦90045 in Yoppa they took him up to the room. All the widows¦90057 stood¦90053 there, sobbing and showing¦90060 him various clothes¦90063 that Tabitha had made for them.
\v 40 But Peter had them all removed from the room, and then kneeling down he prayed¦90090 before turning back to the body¦90095 and said¦90096, “Tabitha¦90097, get up.” Then she opened¦90101 her¦90104 eyes¦90103, and seeing Peter there she sat¦90109 up.
\v 41 Peter helped her to stand up, then he called¦90118 the believers and the widows¦90124, and presented¦90128 the live Tabitha to them.
\v 42 News of this spread throughout¦90134 Yoppa¦90137 and¦90138 many people there believed¦90140 in the \nd master¦90144\nd*.
\v 43 So Peter stayed on there for quite a few days¦90148, living with a tanner¦90158 of hides named Simon¦90157.

\s1 Peter and Cornelius each hear from God
\rem /s1 Cornelius Calls for Peter
\rem /s1 Peter and Cornelius
\p
\v 1 Just up in Caesarea¦90164 there was a Roman army commander named Cornelius (leader of the ‘Italian¦90174 Regiment’)
\v 2 who, along with all his household¦90183, worshipped God and obeyed his laws. He gave to the poor and regularly asked God for help.
\v 3 One afternoon around 3pm he had a vision¦90199 where he clearly¦90200 saw¦90197 one of God's messengers¦90208 come¦90211 into the house and call, “Cornelius.”
\p
\v 4 Cornelius was scared and looked¦90220 intently¦90220 and asked, “What is it, master¦90228?”
\p “Your¦90234 prayers¦90233 and your¦90234 helping the poor rose up to God's notice and attention,” he said.
\v 5 “Now, send some messengers to Yoppa¦90251 to go and find a man there named Simon¦90255 Peter.
\v 6 He's staying with Simon¦90267 the tanner¦90269 whose¦90270 house¦90273 is by the sea¦90275.”
\v 7 So as soon as the messenger¦90287 left, Cornelius called¦90293 two¦90294 of his house¦90296 servants¦90296 and¦90298 a godly¦90300 soldier¦90299 from his bodyguard,
\v 8 and after explaining¦90305 the task to them, he sent¦90311 them off to Yoppa¦90315.
\rem /s1 Peter's Vision
\rem /s1 Peter Visits Cornelius
\p
\v 9 The next day¦90316 as they were approaching the town, Peter went¦90326 up onto the flat roof of the house¦90330 around midday to pray.
\v 10 But he felt hungry¦90339 and wanted something to eat, but while it was still being prepared¦90343 he fell into a trance¦90353
\v 11 and saw the sky open up. Something like a sheet¦90366 was being¦90374 lowered down to the earth¦90377 by the four¦90368 corners¦90369
\v 12 and it held all kinds of animals and reptiles¦90391, as well as birds¦90396.
\v 13 Then he heard a voice¦90401 saying, “Get up Peter, and slaughter these and eat¦90408 them.”
\p
\v 14 “I can't, \nd master¦90414\nd*,” Peter responded, “because¦90415 I've never¦90416 eaten anything that's forbidden.”
\p
\v 15 But the voice¦90424 spoke a second¦90429 time¦90429, “Don't you¦90436 be treating anything as unclean that \nd God¦90434\nd* has made clean¦90435.”
\v 16 This vision happened three¦90444 times and¦90445 then the sheet thing was lifted back up into the sky.
\p
\v 17 Now Peter was still there wondering what the vision¦90469 was all about when the men¦90475 sent¦90477 by Cornelius had tracked down the tanner's house¦90485 and arrived outside.
\v 18 They called out to ask if Simon¦90497 Peter was staying there.
\p
\v 19 Even as Peter still continued to ponder¦90507 about¦90508 the vision¦90510, the \nd spirit¦90515\nd* said¦90511, “Hey, there's three¦90520 men¦90518 here looking¦90521 for¦90521 you¦90523.
\v 20 So get up and¦90528 go downstairs to them. Believe everything they say because¦90536 I sent¦90539 them here.”
\v 21 So he went down and asked the men¦90549, “I'm the one you're looking¦90562 for, so tell me what you came here for.”
\p
\v 22 They answered, “We were sent by Cornelius who's an army commander who worships \nd God¦90586\nd* and obeys his laws and has a good reputation with you Jewish people. A holy messenger¦90598 told him¦90605 to send¦90600 for you to come to his house¦90604 so they can listen¦90607 to what you have to say.”
\v 23 So¦90614 Peter invited them in to stay the night.
\rem /s1 Peter at Cornelius' House
\p The next day¦90620, Peter and¦90629 some of the believers¦90632 from Yoppa¦90636 started out with them
\v 24 and they arrived in Caesarea¦90650 the following day¦90642. Cornelius was expecting¦90656 them and had also invited some relatives¦90661 and close¦90666 friends¦90667 to join them.
\v 25 Peter entered the house and when they met, Cornelius knelt down and worshipped him
\v 26 but Peter pulled him¦90711 up and said, “Stand up. I'm just a man like you.”
\v 27 After greeting each other, Peter went into the main room and¦90733 found that quite a few people had gathered there.
\v 28 Then he told them, “You all know that us Jews¦90750 are forbidden by our laws to associate with or to enter the house of a non-Jew. However, \nd God¦90763\nd* showed¦90765 me that it's not right to treat other¦90756 people as being¦90752 lesser or undesirable.
\v 29 That's why I came¦90775 without any reservations when you sent for me. But I'm still waiting to know what you all want from me?”
\p
\v 30 So Cornelius answered, “I was praying¦90810 in my¦90814 house¦90813 three days ago in the middle of the afternoon when I suddenly saw a man¦90817 in shining¦90824 clothes¦90823 standing in front of me
\v 31 and he said, ‘Your¦90830 prayer¦90833 has been heard, Cornelius¦90827, and \nd God¦90844\nd* has noticed your¦90830 gifts to the poor.
\v 32 Now he wants you to send¦90845 messengers to get Simon, the one called¦90853 Peter, from Yoppa¦90848 where he's living by the sea¦90867 in Simon the tanner's¦90863 house¦90859.’
\v 33 I did that straight away and you kindly came here, so now we're all here in God's \add sight\add* to find out everything that the \nd master¦90913\nd* has commanded¦90907 you to say.”

\v 35 but he accepts¦90943 people from any nation¦90936 as long as they honour and obey him.
\v 36 He sent us a message through the descendants of Israel—a good message that teaches that we can have peace¦90957 through \nd Yeshua¦90959\nd* the \nd messiah¦90960\nd*—everyone's \nd master¦90964\nd*.
\v 37 And you all know the news that started in Galilee¦90980 and spread through¦90971 all Yudea¦90974 after¦90981 the time of Yohan's teaching and ministry of immersion¦90983—
\v 38 how God filled \nd Yeshua¦90987\nd* from Nazareth¦90990 with the holy \nd spirit¦90997\nd* and with power¦91001, and who then went around doing¦91007 good¦91007 and healing¦91009 all those oppressed¦91012 by the devil¦91016, because¦91017 God was with him.
\v 39 We are witnesses¦91028 of all the things he did in the Jewish provinces and in Yerusalem¦91041, and then how he was executed by them on a stake¦91048.

\v 5 “I was staying in Yoppa¦91354, and as I was praying¦91356 I saw¦91358 a vision¦91361 of an object¦91364 like a sheet¦91367 coming¦91362 down, as if it was being¦91372 let down out of the sky by its four¦91369 corners¦91371. As it came¦91378 down to me
\v 6 I looked¦91384 at it and saw¦91387 animals, even wild animals, and reptiles¦91397 and birds¦91400.
\v 7 I also heard¦91404 a voice¦91407 telling me, ‘Peter, get up and slaughter these and eat¦91417 them.’

\v 10 This happened three¦91459 times, and¦91460 then it was pulled¦91462 up again¦91463 into the sky.

\v 13 He told us how he'd seen one \add of God's\add* messengers¦91523 standing there in his¦91527 house¦91526 and who'd told him¦91527, ‘Send \add someone\add* to Yoppa¦91535 to fetch Simon¦91539, the one called¦91541 Peter,
\v 14 and he will explain to you how you and all your¦91557 household¦91556 can be saved¦91551.’
\v 15 Then when I started speaking¦91563 to them, the holy \nd spirit¦91568\nd* came down on them just like it had happened to us previously.
\v 16 That reminded¦91581 me of the words of the \nd master¦91587\nd* when he told us, ‘Yohan¦91590 immersed people in water¦91593, but you all will be immersed in the holy \nd spirit¦91598\nd*.
\v 17 Therefore¦91602 if God gave¦91606 the same¦91604 gift¦91605 to them that he'd given to us when we'd believed¦91614 in the \nd master¦91617 Yeshua¦91618\nd* the \nd messiah¦91619\nd*, what authority did I have to contradict God?’ ”
\p
\v 18 When the group heard¦91637 all this, they had no objections and they praised God, saying¦91647, “It seems that God has also allowed the pagans¦91652 to repent¦91656 and live.”

\p
\v 19 Over time, due to the persecution that began with Stephen's killing, the ones who had moved away went as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch¦91681, but they only shared Yeshua's teaching with other Jews¦91691.
\v 20 However, some of the believers were from Cyprus and Cyrene, and when they got to Antioch¦91706 they proclaimed the good¦91714 news from the \nd master¦91716 Yeshua¦91717\nd* to the Greeks.
\v 21 And the master caused their efforts to prosper, so a large number¦91728 of Greeks believed¦91730 and decided to follow the master.
\p
\v 22 News about this reached the assembly¦91743 in Yerusalem¦91747, so they¦91752 sent¦91752 Barnabas¦91753 to Antioch¦91757.
\v 23 When he arrived¦91760 and saw how God's grace¦91764 \add was spreading\add*, he was elated¦91768 and encouraged them all to earnestly continue to follow the \nd master¦91779\nd*.
\v 24 Barnabas was good¦91784 man¦91782 and full of the holy \nd spirit¦91787\nd* and full of faith¦91790 \add in God\add*, and a large¦91794 number of people decided to follow Yeshua.
\p
\v 25 So Barnabas went to Tarsus¦91804 to look for Saul,
\v 26 and when he found¦91816 him, he brought¦91819 him back to Antioch. Then for a whole¦91833 year¦91832 they met with the assembly¦91838 and \add regularly\add* taught a large¦91843 crowd¦91842. It was there in Antioch that the believers were first¦91848 called Christians.
\p
\v 27 In those days¦91868, some prophets¦91872 from Yerusalem¦91871 went to Antioch¦91874,
\v 28 and one of them named Agabus when he was prompted by the \nd spirit¦91895\nd*, stood¦91883 up and predicted that the world¦91905 would experience a severe famine¦91896 (and this happened \add later\add* during¦91910 the reign of Claudius).
\v 29 The believers decided to send¦91929 assistance to their¦91926 fellow¦91935 believers who lived in Yudea¦91934—each one according to his means—
\v 30 and so they¦91940 did, sending their contributions with Barnabus¦91947 and Saul¦91949 to take to the elders¦91944.

\v 1 Around that time¦91955, King Herod¦91959 \add Agrippa\add* used his power to mistreat¦91965 some of the believers from the assembly¦91970,
\v 2 and he had Yacob¦91977, the brother¦91979 of Yohan¦91980, executed by the sword¦91982.
\v 3 Then when he saw that it pleased¦91987 the Jewish religious leaders, he went on to seize Peter during the Feast of Flat Bread.
\v 4 After being arrested¦92010, Peter was put in prison¦92014 where he was guarded¦92021 by four squads¦92019 of four soldiers¦92020 each. After the Passover Feast, Herod planned to display Peter to the people¦92031,
\v 5 but while he was being¦92036 held in prison¦92039, those in the assembly¦92055 were earnestly¦92047 asking God¦92035 to help him.

\p
\v 6 Herod¦92073 planned to send for Peter later that evening, but meanwhile Peter had fallen¦92080 asleep¦92080 chained with two chains between¦92081 two soldiers¦92083. There were also prison¦92098 guards¦92087 at the door¦92094
\v 7 but one of the \nd master's¦92102\nd* messengers \add suddenly appeared\add* standing by Peter and light¦92107 radiated through the prison¦92112 cell. The messenger poked Peter in the side to wake him up, saying¦92122, “Quickly, get up!” The chains¦92131 fell off his¦92129 wrists
\v 8 and the messenger said, “Get dressed and put on your sandals¦92149,” so he did. Then the messenger said, “Now put on your coat¦92159 and follow¦92162 me.”
\v 9 So Peter followed¦92166 the messenger¦92179 out of the cell, not really knowing¦92170 if it was real or if he was still dreaming.
\v 10 They went past the first¦92187 guard¦92188 and then the second¦92190, and then came to the iron gate which led out of the prison into the city¦92203. The gate opened¦92206 by itself and they went out onto the street, then at the end of the street the messenger¦92225 suddenly left him.
\p
\v 11 By now Peter was fully awake and said¦92236 to himself¦92234, “Now I know that the \nd master¦92244\nd* really did send his¦92247 messenger¦92246 to rescue¦92249 me from Herod¦92254 and from the plans of the Jewish leaders.”
\p
\v 12 Now that he realised this, he went to Maria's¦92272 house¦92270 (the mother¦92274 of Yohan¦92275 Mark) where¦92280 many believers had met to pray.
\v 13 He knocked¦92286 at the door¦92293 in the fence and a servant¦92298 girl¦92298 named Rhoda came out to see who it was.
\v 14 But when she recognised¦92305 Peter's voice¦92307, she was so excited that she forgot about opening the door, but ran back inside to tell everyone that Peter was standing out there.
\v 15 They told her that she must be raving¦92337 mad, but she insisted¦92340 it was true, but they said¦92335 that it must be his¦92354 messenger¦92351.
\p
\v 16 Meanwhile Peter continued¦92358 knocking¦92359, and when they eventually opened¦92361 the outer door, they saw¦92364 that it¦92361 was him¦92367 and they were amazed.
\v 17 But Peter signalled them with his hand¦92376 to be quiet, and then he explained how the \nd master¦92388\nd* had led him out of the prison¦92393, and instructed them, “Tell this to Yacob¦92398 and the brothers¦92401.” Then he left and went off to another¦92407 place¦92408.
\p
\v 18 Once daylight came, there¦92412 was pandemonium among¦92416 the soldiers¦92418 \add in the prison as they tried to figure out\add* what had happened to Peter.
\v 19 Then when King Herod sent for Peter and he wasn't there, the prison guards¦92434 were interrogated and then taken away to be executed.

\p
\v 20 Now King Herod was disputing with the people of Tyre¦92454 and Tsidon, and so they got together and persuaded¦92472 Blastos¦92473, a close personal servant of the king, to be their¦92487 spokesman in asking for peace¦92483 because¦92484 they were dependent on food from the king's provinces.
\p
\v 21 On the agreed day¦92499, Herod¦92501 dressed¦92502 in his royal¦92504 garments and seated on his throne, started to address¦92510 them.
\v 22 The crowd shouted out, “This is the voice¦92523 of a \nd god¦92522\nd*, not of a man.”
\v 23 Because he didn't attribute the honour to \nd God¦92544\nd*, one the \nd master's¦92536\nd* messengers¦92535 immediately¦92530 struck¦92533 him down and he stopped¦92556 breathing¦92556 as a result of a worm infestation.
\p
\v 24 Meanwhile God's message¦92559 continued to spread and¦92565 multiply¦92566.

\s1 Sergius believes after Bar-Jesus is blinded
\p
\v 6 They travelled around the island¦92723 and when they got to Paphos, they met a Jewish man¦92729 named Bar-Jesus.\f + \fr 13:6 \ft The Greek form of his name was Elymas according to verse 8.\f* He was a sorcerer and false¦92733 prophet¦92733
\v 7 who was with Sergius Paulus the proconsul¦92747, an intelligent¦92751 man¦92750. Sergius sent for Barnabas¦92755 and Saul because he wanted to hear¦92762 God's message¦92764 from them,
\v 8 but the sorcerer opposed them and tried to prevent Sergius¦92770 from believing.
\v 9 So then Saul¦92790 (the \add Roman\add* form of his name was Paul¦92794), filled¦92795 with the holy \nd spirit¦92796\nd* looked¦92799 intently¦92799 at Bar-Jesus
\v 10 and said¦92802, “You're full of all kinds of deceit¦92806 and fraud¦92810 you child of the devil¦92813. Will you never stop twisting the truth about following the \nd master¦92823\nd*?

\p And immediately¦92846 he could only see fog and darkness¦92858, and needed someone to guide him around¦92860 by the hand.

\v 13 After that, Paul\f + \fr 13:13 \ft From this point on in the text, Paul is referred to by his Roman name as his ministry is largely outside of Israel. (In Israel he seemed to be better known as Saul, the Greek form of his Hebrew name Sha-ul.)\f* and his companions sailed from Paphos to Perga¦92895 in Pamphylia, but Yohan¦92898 Mark left them and returned¦92903 to Yerusalem¦92906.
\v 14 Paul and his companions, went on from Perga¦92913 to Pisidian¦92921 Antioch¦92917, where they entered the Jewish¦92927 meeting¦92927 hall¦92927 on the Rest Day and sat¦92936 down \add with the congregation\add*.
\v 15 After the readings¦92940 from the Law and from the Prophets,\f + \fr 13:15 \ft The Hebrew Scriptures are divided into the Law, the Prophets, and the Writings.\f* the leaders¦92948 sent¦92946 a messenger over to them to ask, “Men, brothers¦92953, if you¦92961 bring any message¦92962 of encouragement for the congregation, please share it¦92967.”
\p
\v 16 So Paul¦92971 stood¦92968 up and, motioning with his hand¦92975, started speaking, “Fellow Israelis and every who reveres¦92982 \nd God¦92984\nd*, listen¦92985 to me.
\v 17 The \nd God¦92987\nd* of the people of Israel chose¦92993 our¦92996 ancestors¦92995 and helped the people to prosper when they were staying in Egypt¦93009. Then later he showed his power as he led them out
\v 18 and¦93018 endured¦93025 them in the wilderness¦93029 for around forty years.
\v 19 Then having¦93031 overthrown seven¦93033 nations¦93032 in Caanan,\x + \xo 13:19: a \xt Deu 7:1; \xo b \xt Josh 14:1.\x* he passed on that land as an inheritance
\v 20 after¦93055 around 450 years¦93050.
\p “Then he gave¦93057 them judges¦93058 through until¦93059 the time of the prophet¦93062 Samuel
\v 21 when they¦93064 requested¦93064 a king¦93065, and¦93066 \nd God¦93070\nd* gave¦93067 them Saul, the son of Kish from the tribe¦93077 of Benyamin to reign for forty¦93080 years¦93079.
\v 22 After Saul was removed¦93082, God chose David to be their king¦93090—the man of whom he said, ‘I found¦93095 David the son of Jesse¦93100, a man who wants to obey me and do everything I ask.’
\v 23 Then eventually a descendant of David arrived in Israel as promised¦93121—the saviour¦93127 \nd Yeshua¦93129\nd*.
\v 24 Before he arrived Yohan-the-Immerser had publicly¦93130 preached to all the people¦93141 of Israel about being immersed¦93137 \add as a sign\add* of repentance¦93138.
\v 25 As Yohan's ministry was nearing an end, he asked, ‘Who do you suspect¦93156 I am? I'm not the messiah, but he will come after¦93164 me, and I'm not \add even\add* worthy¦93170 to undo his sandals¦93173.’
\p
\v 26 “Men, brothers¦93178, descendants¦93180 of Abraham¦93181 and¦93182 others here who revere¦93187 \nd God¦93189\nd*, the teaching about this salvation¦93196 has been sent¦93198 to us.
\v 27 The people of Yerusalem¦93204 and their \add religious\add* leaders didn't recognise this \add Yeshua\add*, but by their judgement¦93226 of him they¦93227 fulfilled¦93227 the words of the prophets¦93218 that are read every¦93221 Rest Day.
\v 28 Despite not finding even one charge against him worthy of death¦93231, they requested¦93238 Pilate¦93241 to execute him
\v 29 and when they had done all the things that \add the prophets\add* had written¦93258 about him, they took his body down from the stake¦93273 and placed it in a burial chamber.
\v 30 But \nd God¦93281\nd* brought him¦93283 back to life
\v 31 and his¦93310 followers who had come¦93293 to Yerusalem¦93300 from Galilee¦93298 saw him for several days¦93290 and now testify about this to the people¦93313.
\v 32 So now we're preaching¦93317 this good¦93317 message¦93317 to you¦93316 that what God promised¦93323 to our ancestors¦93321
\v 33 has now been fulfilled¦93330 for our¦93335 descendants, now that \nd God¦93329\nd* brought \nd Yeshua¦93341\nd* back to life just like it's written¦93355 in the second¦93357 psalm¦93353:
\q1 ‘You are my¦93360 son;
\q1 today¦93364 I have borne you.’
\m
\v 34 God brought him¦93389 back to life, and he's never going¦93393 to return¦93394 \add to the grave\add* to decay¦93396. As God said¦93398,
\q1 ‘I will give David's faithful¦93406 devout¦93403 \add things???\add* to you¦93401 all.’
\m
\v 35 So¦93407 in another¦93411 psalm¦93411 God said,
\q1 ‘You won't allow your¦93418 devout¦93417 one to experience decay¦93420.’
\m
\v 36 This can't be David¦93421, because after he'd served his own generation¦93425 as \nd God¦93429\nd* led him, he indeed died and was buried with his ancestors¦93436 and his body decayed¦93440.
\v 37 On the contrary, the one who \nd God¦93445\nd* raised¦93446 from the dead never experienced decay¦93449.
\v 38 So¦93451 brothers¦93456, let it¦93452 be known¦93450 to you all that your sins¦93464 can now be forgiven¦93462 through¦93458 this \add Yeshua\add*—the law of Moses was never able to offer you that.
\v 39 Everyone who puts their trust in \add Yeshua\add* is able to receive a clean record.
\v 40 But keep your eyes open in case something else the prophets¦93500 wrote might come¦93493 true:
\q1
\v 41 ‘Watch¦93501 you scoffers¦93503, and be amazed and die because¦93511 I'm doing¦93515 something special during your¦93520 time.
\q1 Even if someone¦93528 described¦93529 it clearly to you all, you still might not believe¦93526 it.’ ”
\p
\v 42 As they¦93542 left the meeting hall after¦93549 the service, the people invited them to speak again the following Rest Day.
\v 43 But when they starting walking away, many people followed¦93563 after¦93572 Paul¦93572 and Barnabas¦93575, who then addressed¦93577 them and encouraged them to continue trusting in God's grace¦93586.
\rem /s1 Paul Turns to the Gentiles
\p
\v 44 So on the following Rest Day, nearly everyone in the city¦93610 had gathered¦93611 there to hear¦93612 the message¦93618 from \nd God¦93623\nd*.
\v 45 But the Jewish religious leaders became very jealous¦93634 when they saw the crowds¦93631 and claimed that Paul's words had slandered¦93646 God.
\v 46 But Paul¦93652 and Barnabas¦93655 responded boldly¦93647, “It was necessary¦93662 for God's message¦93667 to be explained in the meeting hall to all of \add the Jews\add* first¦93663. But since you are rejecting that teaching, you are all judging¦93678 yourselves¦93681 to be unworthy of living forever, so instead, we will \add now\add* share it with the non-Jews¦93691.
\v 47 Because this is what the \nd master¦93698\nd* commanded¦93694 us:
\q1 ‘I have chosen you to be a light¦93704 for the pagans¦93706;
\q2 You will take salvation¦93712 to the end of the earth¦93716.’
\p
\v 48 When the non-Jews¦93721 heard that, they¦93722 were very happy and were praising the \nd master's¦93731\nd* message¦93728, and as many as were appointed¦93736 to \add receive\add* eternal¦93739 life¦93738 believed¦93733 \add it¦93718\add*.
\p
\v 49 So from there, the \nd master's¦93747\nd* message¦93745 spread throughout the entire¦93750 region¦93752.
\v 50 But the Jewish religious leaders¦93767 incited¦93756 some prominent¦93763 women¦93760 from the meeting halls and some from the local city¦93769 government, and they then stirred¦93771 up persecution¦93775 against¦93776 Paul¦93778 and Barnabas¦93781 and had them expelled out of their¦93788 region¦93787.
\v 51 So Paul and Barnabas just left that place to face their own consequences, and continued on to Iconium.
\v 52 Meanwhile the believers \add back in Pisidian Antioch\add* were full of happiness and¦93810 of the holy \nd spirit¦93811\nd*.

\rem /s1 In Iconium
\p
\v 1 A similar thing happened in Iconium. Paul and Barnabas went into the Jewish¦93825 meeting¦93825 hall¦93825 and spoke in such as way that a lot of both Jews¦93827 and Greeks believed¦93834.
\v 2 But those Jews who didn't believe got the non-Jews¦93867 emotionally stirred¦93856 up to oppose the believers¦93870.
\v 3 So¦93879 Paul and Barnabas ended up staying there for quite a while, and as they spoke boldly¦93884 for the \nd master¦93887\nd*, he himself confirmed his¦93895 grace¦93894 by enabling the two of them to be able to do miracles and amazing things.
\v 4 Nevertheless, the people¦93913 of the city¦93915 were divided¦93908—some agreeing with the \add strict\add* Jews¦93922, and others supporting the missionaries.
\p
\v 5 At one point, both the non-Jews¦93940 and the strict Jews and their¦93948 leaders got worked up enough to come in order to attack them and throw¦93951 rocks to kill them.
\v 6 However, Paul and Barnabas found out about it and escaped to the Lycaonian cities¦93958 of Lystra and Derbe and the surrounding¦93967 region¦93967
\v 7 and¦93969 preached¦93971 the good¦93971 message¦93971 there¦93969.

\v 10 So in a loud¦94037 voice¦94039, Paul said¦94036, “Stand¦94049 upright on your¦94053 feet¦94052.” And the man sprang¦94063 up and was walking¦94066 around.
\v 11 The crowd¦94070 of people who saw what Paul¦94076 had done began to shout out in Lycaonian, “These two look like men¦94087, but they're really gods¦94084 who have come down to us!”
\v 12 They called Barnabas¦94097 ‘Zeus’ and called Paul¦94102 ‘Hermas¦94103’ since¦94105 he was the main speaker.
\v 13 And the priest¦94117 of Zeus wanted to sacrifice¦94144 with the crowds¦94140, so he brought¦94136 bulls¦94129 and garlands¦94132 \add of flowers\add* to the city gates¦94135 from \add the temple\add* on the path to the city.
\p
\v 14 But when the missionaries Barnabas¦94150 and Paul¦94152 heard¦94145 what was going on, they tore their clothes \add in dismay\add* as they rushed¦94159 out into the crowd¦94164
\v 15 shouting, “Men, why are you doing¦94173 all these things? We are only humans¦94180 just like all of you. We were bringing you the good message about abandoning these useless¦94191 \add sacrifices\add* and turning¦94193 to the living¦94199 \nd God¦94197\nd* who made heaven¦94205 and the earth¦94208 and the sea¦94211 and everything in them.\x + \xo 14:15: \xt Exo 20:11.\x*
\v 16 In previous generations¦94222 he allowed¦94223 all the nations¦94227 to go their¦94231 own different ways¦94230,
\v 17 but he never left himself without¦94237 evidence of himself—sending good¦94243 rains¦94247 from heaven¦94244 to give you all fruitful¦94252 seasons¦94251 with food to fill \add your stomachs\add* and happiness to fill your hearts¦94258.”
\v 18 By saying¦94263 these¦94262 things, they¦94266 were eventually just able to restrain¦94266 the people from sacrificing¦94272 to them.
\p
\v 19 But some \add strict\add* Jews¦94298 came over from \add Pisidian\add* Antioch¦94290 and Iconium and were able to persuade¦94303 the crowds¦94307. They threw rocks at Paul¦94324 \add to kill him\add* and dragged¦94326 his body outside¦94328 the city¦94330 \add gates\add* thinking¦94331 that he was dead.
\v 20 But as the believers were standing around him, Paul got up and went back into the city¦94350, but he left¦94355 again with Barnabas¦94358 the next day¦94352 and went to Derbe.
\s1 Paul and Barnabas return to the sending assembly in Antioch

\p
\v 21 They preached¦94361 the good¦94361 message¦94361 in Derbe, and after giving further training¦94373 to many of them, they¦94377 returned¦94377 to Lystra and Iconium and Antioch¦94387.
\v 22 There they strengthened¦94388 the faith¦94399 of the believers—encouraging them to continue believing and¦94400 to expect that it's normal to endure a lot of suffering on the path to God's kingdom¦94412.
\v 23 They appointed some elders for \add each\add* assembly¦94420, then they fasted and prayed¦94422 for the elders—asking the \nd master¦94429\nd* that they believed¦94432 in to look after them.
\p
\v 24 After passing through¦94435 Pisidia¦94439, they¦94440 arrived at Pamphylia
\v 25 and¦94445 after teaching the master's message¦94453 in Perga¦94450, they¦94456 went down to \add the coastal city of\add* Attalia¦94458.
\v 26 From there¦94461, they sailed¦94462 \add back\add* to \add Syrian\add* Antioch¦94464 where the congregation had prayed for God's grace¦94469 to be with them\x + \xo 14:26: \xt 13:3.\x* for the work they had just fulfilled¦94476.
\p
\v 27 So when they arrived¦94477, they gathered¦94480 the assembly¦94483 together¦94480 there and shared about what \nd God¦94489\nd* had done with them and how he had opened¦94498 up the door¦94501 of faith¦94502 to the non-Jews¦94500.
\v 28 Then they¦94503 stayed on with them there for quite a while.

\s1 The decision from the Yerusalem elders
\rem /s1 The Meeting at Jerusalem
\rem /s1 The Council at Jerusalem
\p
\v 1 Then some \add people\add* came \add to Antioch\add* from Yudea¦94517 and were teaching the believers¦94520 that according to Moses' teachings, you can't be saved¦94537 unless you've been circumcised¦94526.
\v 2 This led to no end of argument and debate¦94545 between them and Paul¦94549 and Barnabas until it was decided that the two of them and some other¦94584 believers should go to Yerusalem¦94597 to ask the missionaries and the elders¦94595 there about¦94602 this issue.
\p
\v 3 So indeed¦94607 the assembly¦94612 sent¦94609 the group on their way, and as they passed through¦94613 Phoenicia and Samaria¦94619, they described¦94621 how non-Jews¦94625 had become believers and this news made the believers there¦94608 very happy.
\p
\v 4 When they arrived¦94633 in Yerusalem¦94636, they were welcomed by the assembly¦94645 and the missionaries and the elders¦94651, and they explained how \nd God¦94658\nd* had used them.
\v 5 But some of the believers¦94682 who were also members of the Pharisee¦94681 party¦94681 stood up and said, “It's quite proper for them to be circumcised¦94686 and to be commanded¦94688 to keep the Jewish religious laws.”
\p
\v 6 So the missionaries and¦94700 the elders¦94702 met separately in order to consider the matter¦94706 further.
\v 7 After a lot of debate¦94711, Peter stood¦94738 up and said, “Men, brothers¦94748, all of you here know that some time back, \nd God¦94760\nd* chose¦94758 me to be a mouthpiece¦94766 so that the non-Jews¦94770 could hear the good message and believe¦94776.
\v 8 And \nd God¦94782\nd* who knows even people's inner thoughts, gave them the same holy \nd spirit¦94792\nd* that he gave us,
\v 9 and when he purified¦94808 their¦94811 minds by the faith¦94807, he didn't do anything different for them than he did for us.
\v 10 So¦94813 why are you¦94815 all provoking \nd God¦94817\nd* by putting a load on the shoulders of these believers that neither¦94826 we¦94831, nor our¦94829 ancestors¦94828, were ever able to bear?
\v 11 But we¦94842 ourselves have believed¦94842 thanks to the grace¦94837 of \nd Yeshua¦94840\nd* the \nd master¦94839\nd*, and they can be saved¦94844 in just the same way.”
\p
\v 12 The whole group sat in silence¦94858, and then they listened to Barnabas¦94866 and Paul¦94869 as they described everything that \nd God¦94876\nd* had done among¦94880 the non-Jews¦94882 through them, including miracles and amazing things.
\v 13 Then while they were still silent¦94888, Yacob¦94892 responded, “Men, brothers¦94896, listen¦94897 to me.
\v 14 Simon Peter has told us how \nd God¦94904\nd* first¦94902 intervened in order to select a people¦94910 for himself from among the non-Jews¦94908.
\v 15 And this actually agrees¦94918 with the message¦94921 that the prophets¦94923 recorded,
\q1
\v 16 ‘After¦94926 these¦94928 things have happened I will return¦94930,
\q1 and I will rebuild the worship tent from David's time that has collapsed,
\q1 Although it was overturned¦94941, I will rebuild and restore¦94947 it,
\q1
\v 17 so that the remaining people¦94955 will want to find the master,
\q1 and also the non-Jews¦94962 who cried out to me.
\q1 The master who is doing¦94974 these¦94976 things is saying¦94971 this,
\q1
\v 18 and planned it this way from eternity¦94981.’
\p
\v 19 Because of this, my ruling is not to be troubling¦94996 the non-Jews¦95000 who are turning¦95001 back to \nd God¦95004\nd*,
\v 20 but to write¦95006 to them to keep away from anything polluted¦95012 by idols¦95014, from sexual¦95017 immorality¦95017, and from strangled¦95020 animals¦95020 and \add eating or drinking\add* blood¦95023.
\v 21 Moses' writings have been preached in every city¦95040 and are read in \add our\add* meeting¦95052 halls¦95052 on every Rest Day.
\s1 The letter is carried to Antioch
\rem /s1 The Letter for Gentile Believers

\p
\v 22 So the missionaries and elders¦95064 with all the assembly¦95068 decided to choose some men to accompany Paul¦95078 and Barnabas¦95080 to Antioch¦95075, so they chose¦95069 Yudas (nicknamed Barsabbas¦95085) and Silas¦95088 who were leaders among¦95092 the believers¦95094,
\v 23 This is what they wrote¦95095: This letter is from the missionaries and elders¦95108, your brothers \add here in Yerusalem\add* to our non-Jewish fellow believers¦95111 in Antioch¦95115 and Syria and Cilicia.
\v 24 Since¦95129 we heard¦95132 that some people who weren't sent by us came from here and disturbed¦95140 you all with their upsetting¦95143 messages¦95142,
\v 25 we unanimously agreed to select some men¦95162 to accompany our¦95170 dear \add friends\add* Barnabas¦95171 and¦95172 Paul¦95173 back.
\v 26 These are men¦95174 who have dedicated their¦95181 lives¦95179 to our¦95187 \nd master¦95186\nd*, \nd Yeshua¦95188\nd* the \nd messiah¦95189\nd*.
\v 27 So¦95194 we've sent¦95193 Yudas¦95195 and Silas¦95197 and they'll confirm in person what we are writing.
\v 28 It seemed right to the holy \nd spirit¦95210\nd* and¦95214 to us to not burden¦95223 you¦95222 all with anything more than the following commands:
\v 29 you all must keep away from anything sacrificed¦95230 to idols, from \add eating or drinking\add* blood¦95232 or strangled¦95235 animals¦95235, and from sexual¦95237 immorality¦95237. You will do well if you avoid these things. Farewell.
\p
\v 30 So¦95262 they were sent¦95263 off and when they arrived at Antioch¦95270, they gathered¦95272 the believers and handed¦95276 across the letter¦95278,
\v 31 and when they read it¦95279, they were very happy with the encouraging contents.
\p
\v 32 Yudas and Barnabas were both prophets¦95292, and said a lot to encourage them and strengthen¦95306 \add their faith\add*.
\v 33 After they'd stayed there¦95310 for a while, the believers¦95316 sent them home carrying greetings from them to the assembly \add back in Yerusalem\add*.
\p
\v 34 ≈
\v 35 But Paul¦95338 and Barnabas¦95341 stayed on there in Antioch¦95344, teaching¦95345 them and preaching¦95347 the good message along with many others¦95351.
\s1 Paul and Barnabas go separate ways
\rem /s1 Paul and Barnabas Separate
\rem /s1 Disagreement Between Paul and Barnabas
\p
\v 36 After a few days¦95360, Paul¦95366 suggested to Barnabas¦95365, “Let's go back and visit¦95370 the believers¦95372 in each city¦95377 where we proclaimed¦95383 the \nd master's¦95387\nd* message¦95385, and see how they're doing.”
\v 37 Barnabas¦95390 agreed and wanted to take¦95395 Yohan¦95399 Mark¦95403 along¦95395 with them as well,
\v 38 but Paul¦95404 didn't want to take him because he had left them in Pamphylia¦95417 instead of continuing with them in their work.
\v 39 And so it turned into such a disagreement that the two of them each went their different ways. Barnabas¦95448 took Yohan Mark with him and¦95447 sailed to Cyprus
\v 40 while Paul¦95459 chose¦95462 Silas¦95463 and they left¦95464 after being entrusted to the \nd master's¦95469\nd* grace¦95467 by the believers¦95474.
\v 41 They went through¦95475 Syria and¦95482 Cilicia, strengthening¦95487 the assemblies¦95489 there.

\s1 Paul and Silas also take Timothy with them
\rem /s1 Timothy Joins Paul and Silas

\p
\v 1 Then Paul went to Derbe and¦95505 then on to Lystra where a believer named Timothy¦95516 lived. His mother was a Jewish believer, but¦95523 his father¦95522 was Greek.
\v 2 The believers¦95534 in Lystra and¦95531 Iconium spoke well of Timothy
\v 3 and Paul¦95538 wanted¦95536 him to accompany them on his trip so he circumcised¦95546 him \add in advance\add* because¦95549 of the Jews¦95551 in that region—everyone knew that his father¦95566 was a Greek¦95563.
\v 4 As they passed through¦95575 various towns, they explained the decision of the missionaries and elders¦95605 in Yerusalem¦95609 about which commands they must adhere to.
\v 5 So¦95612 the assemblies¦95613 were strengthened¦95614 in this way and¦95617 their numbers¦95620 were increasing each day¦95622.

\v 6 From there, they¦95624 travelled through¦95624 Phrygia and¦95628 the Galatia¦95630 region¦95631, after the holy \nd spirit¦95636\nd* prevented them from proclaiming the message¦95640 in Asia \add Minor\add*.
\v 7 When they got to Mysia, they planned to go on into Bithynia, but \nd Yeshua's¦95668 spirit¦95666\nd* didn't let them,
\v 8 so after leaving Mysia they¦95675 went to Troas.
\v 9 During the night¦95684, Paul¦95687 had a vision¦95680 of a Macedonian man¦95690 standing there and imploring¦95699 him¦95700, “Come on to Macedonia¦95691 and help¦95708 us here.”
\v 10 So as a result of the vision¦95716, we¦95723 decided to go straight to Macedonia¦95727, concluding¦95728 that \nd God¦95733\nd* had called¦95730 us to share the good message with them.

\p
\v 11 From Troas we¦95751 sailed directly to Samothrace¦95753, and¦95756 then on to Neapolis the following¦95758 day¦95755.
\v 12 From there¦95764 we continued on to Philippi which¦95769 is a \add Roman\add* colony¦95779 and the capital city of the Macedonia¦95777 district¦95775 where we stayed for several days.
\v 13 On the Rest Days, we went \add down\add* to the river¦95804 outside¦95798 the \add city\add* gate where¦95805 we thought people might be praying, and we spoke to the women¦95820 who had met there.
\v 14 One of them was Lydia from Thyatira¦95829 who was a seller¦95826 of purple goods\f + \fr 16:14 \ft It's possible that Lydia dyed fabric and sold it, or that she actually made and sold the purple dye itself.\f* and although she already worshipped¦95830 \nd God¦95833\nd*, the \nd master¦95838\nd* opened¦95839 her¦95840 mind¦95841 and she readily accepted what Paul¦95847 was saying.
\v 15 So then Lydia and her¦95855 household were all \add ceremonially\add* immersed¦95850, and then she requested, “If you all consider me to be faithful¦95861 to the \nd master¦95864\nd*, come¦95866 and stay at my¦95872 place.” So she persuaded us.
\s1 Paul and Silas get thrown into prison
\rem /s1 In Prison at Philippi
\rem /s1 Paul and Silas in Prison
\p
\v 16 One time as we were walking to the prayer¦95885 meeting, we met a female slave who was possessed by a spirit¦95890 that enabled her to tell fortunes¦95907, and thanks to that, to earn a lot of money for her masters¦95903.
\v 17 She¦95913 walked along behind us and shouted out, “These¦95920 men¦95922 are slaves¦95923 of the highest¦95927 \nd god¦95925\nd* and they will be telling you¦95932 all how to be saved.”
\v 18 After she'd done this for several days¦95941, Paul¦95946 was so frustrated that he turned¦95948 around and spoke to the spirit¦95950 \add in her\add*, “I command¦95954 you by the authority of \nd Yeshua¦95959\nd* the \nd messiah¦95960\nd* to leave her.”
\p
\v 19 But when her¦95983 masters¦95982 realised that their¦95993 profitable business¦95992 was about to come to an end, they¦96004 grabbed Paul¦96000 and Silas¦96003 and dragged¦96004 them to the authorities at the marketplace¦96007.
\v 20 They brought¦96012 them forward¦96012 to face the magistrates and¦96011 said¦96017, “These¦96019 Jews¦96027 are disturbing¦96022 \add the peace\add* in our¦96024 city¦96026
\v 21 and¦96029 teaching behaviour that we as Romans can neither accept¦96039 nor practice¦96043.”
\v 22 An \add angry\add* crowd¦96051 gathered around and the magistrates ordered for Paul and Silas to have their¦96061 robes¦96063 torn off and then to be beaten with rods.
\v 23 They were severely beaten and then thrown¦96072 into prison where the officer was commanded¦96075 to keep them secure¦96080.
\v 24 Because of that, he threw them into the inner¦96096 cell and locked their¦96099 feet¦96100 in stocks¦96109.
\p
\v 25 Around midnight¦96114 Paul¦96119 and Silas¦96122 were praying¦96123 and singing¦96124 praises to \nd God¦96126\nd*, and the other prisoners¦96133 were listening¦96127 to them.
\v 26 Suddenly there was a strong earthquake¦96136 that shook even the foundations¦96142 of the prison, and immediately¦96150 all the prison doors¦96152 opened¦96145 up and the chains of all the prisoners came loose.
\v 27 The prison officer woke up, and when he saw that all the prison doors¦96170 were open, he drew his sword¦96177 to take his own life as he figured that all the prisoners must have escaped¦96184.
\v 28 But Paul¦96194 shouted out, “Don't harm yourself¦96198! We're all still here!”
\p
\v 29 The officer called for torches, then rushed¦96210 in and knelt down trembling¦96212 in front of Paul¦96220 and Silas¦96223.
\v 30 Then he escorted them out and asked, “Masters¦96237, what do I need to do to be saved¦96243?”
\p
\v 31 “Believe¦96248 in the \nd master¦96252 Yeshua¦96253\nd*,” they replied, “then you and your¦96261 household¦96260 can all be saved¦96256.”
\v 32 Then they explained the message¦96266 about the \nd master¦96269\nd* to him and all those in his¦96277 household¦96276.
\v 33 Even though it was still the middle of the night¦96287, he sponged their¦96291 wounds¦96292, and then him and his¦96303 household were all immersed¦96295 straight away.
\v 34 He took Paul and Silas up into his house¦96315 and gave them a meal, and his whole household were happy because¦96319 they now believed¦96328 in \nd God¦96332\nd*.
\p
\v 35 The next day¦96334 the magistrates sent¦96338 officials¦96341 to tell the jailer to release Paul and Silas.
\p
\v 36 So¦96391 the officer told Paul¦96381, “The magistrates \add sent these officials\add* to order¦96388 that you two to be released.”
\p
\v 37 But Paul¦96400 responded, “You mean that after publicly¦96407 beating us Roman men¦96409 without a trial, they threw us into prison¦96417 and now they want to just quietly release us.”
\p
\v 38 So the officials¦96437 reported¦96430 this back to the magistrates, and they were quite afraid¦96451 when they heard¦96454 that Paul and Silas were Roman \add citizens\add*.
\v 39 So now they came to the prison in person, and appealed¦96468 to them, and escorting them out of prison themselves, asked them to please leave the city¦96492.
\v 40 So after Paul and Silas left the prison¦96507, they went to see Lydia and after encouraging the believers¦96518 there, they left.

\p
\v 1 After travelling¦96530 through¦96530 Amphipolis and Apollonia¦96537, Paul and Silas went to Thessalonica¦96545 where¦96546 there was a Jewish¦96549 meeting¦96549 hall¦96549.
\v 2 Paul's custom was to attend at the local meeting hall on the Rest Day, so he did that, and for three weekends in a row he discussed¦96568 the scriptures¦96575 with them,
\v 3 showing them how that it¦96582 \add had been written\add* that the messiah would suffer¦96583 and be killed and come back to life, and then explaining, “This \nd Yeshua¦96595\nd* that I've been telling you¦96600 about is the messiah.”
\v 4 Some of them were persuaded¦96605 and joined¦96607 with Paul¦96609 and Silas¦96612, along with a big group of godly Greeks and quite a few prominent women¦96626.
\p
\v 5 But some of the other Jews¦96639 were envious \add of them\add*, and enlisted some of the troublemakers from the marketplaces¦96646 to form a mob. They stirred up all the people, and looking¦96665 for¦96665 Paul and Silas so they could bring¦96668 them out, arrived at the house¦96663 of a man named Jason.
\v 6 But when they realised that Paul and Silas weren't there, they dragged¦96677 Jason and some other believers¦96686 off to the city¦96689 leaders, shouting¦96690, “Those two men who've gone around upsetting¦96698 the whole world¦96697 have now come here as well
\v 7 and Jason has welcomed¦96705 them \add into his house\add*. They rebel against Caesar's decrees¦96712 and claim that \nd Yeshua¦96721\nd* is a rival king¦96716.
\v 8 They stirred up the crowd¦96727 and¦96728 the city¦96730 leaders with these¦96736 accusations,
\v 9 so the leaders collected a heavy fine from Jason¦96743 and the others, and then released them.

\v 11 and this group were more upper-class than the congregation in Thessalonica¦96784. They eagerly accepted the message¦96788 and examined¦96795 the scriptures¦96797 every¦96793 day¦96794 to check if what was being taught matched what was written there.
\v 12 Because it did, many of the people believed¦96811 including quite a few of the prominent¦96823 Greeks.
\v 13 But when the Jews¦96840 from Thessalonica¦96839 found out that God's message¦96851 was also being proclaimed¦96846 by Paul¦96849 there¦96864 in Berea, they¦96860 soon turned up to agitate¦96865 and¦96866 stir the crowds¦96869.
\v 14 So the believers¦96881 immediately¦96872 sent¦96879 Paul¦96878 off to the coast, but Silas¦96897 and Timothy¦96900 both stayed.
\v 15 The ones guiding Paul¦96908 took him to Athens before they headed back with his instructions for Silas¦96932 and Timothy¦96935 to come¦96942 and join him again as soon as possible.

\p
\v 16 While Paul¦96955 stayed in Athens waiting for them, he was upset in his¦96959 spirit¦96958 as he observed¦96963 how idolatrous¦96964 the people were.
\v 17 So¦96970 while he stayed busy having discussions¦96968 with the Jews¦96975 and other worshippers¦96978 from the meeting¦96973 hall¦96973, he also spent time every¦96985 day¦96986 with anyone¦96969 who just happened¦96989 to be around in the marketplace¦96983.
\v 18 Some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers¦96998 enjoyed discussing things with him, but others just mocked him, “What does this babbler¦97010 want to talk about now?”
\p But others said, “Seems that he's talking¦97004 about strange¦97016 demons¦97017,” because¦97021 he was preaching¦97028 the good¦97028 message¦97028 about \nd Yeshua¦97023\nd* and coming back to life.
\v 19 So they grabbed him and brought¦97044 him to the Aries Hill \add where the council sat\add* and asked, “Are we allowed to know¦97050 what this new teaching¦97061 that you're bringing is about?
\v 20 It seems that you¦97066 have some surprising¦97062 ideas for our¦97073 ears¦97072, so we¦97074 want to hear what it's all about.”
\v 21 (Everyone¦97094 in Athens and¦97087 even visitors¦97089 often took the opportunity¦97096 either to explain or to listen to any new things.)
\p
\v 22 So Paul¦97109 stood¦97106 up in the middle of the gathering on the hill and spoke, “Men of Athens, I've noticed how you¦97123 all are very religious,
\v 23 because as I was looking around and observing¦97129 your¦97133 objects¦97132 of worship, I even discovered an altar¦97136 that was inscribed¦97141, ‘To the unknown¦97142 \nd god¦97143\nd*.’ So¦97146 without knowing¦97147 it, you already worship this \nd God¦97143\nd* that I'm going to tell you about.
\v 24 This \nd God¦97156\nd* who created the earth and everything in it¦97165 is the \nd master¦97172\nd* of heaven¦97167 and earth. He doesn't live in man-made temples¦97176
\v 25 nor can he be repaired by any human¦97184 hands¦97183 and he doesn't need to be fed. \add On the contrary\add*, he's the one who gives life¦97198 and breath¦97200 and who gives us everything that we need.
\v 26 From one man he made every¦97210 nationality¦97211 that lives across all the earth¦97222 and designated¦97223 their boundaries¦97230 and their futures.
\v 27 He made them so that they would try to discover \nd God¦97239\nd*, and if they did search for him they might find him as he's not far from any one of us
\v 28 because
\q1 ‘We live in him and are moved¦97274 by him and exist through him.’
\m Even some of your own poets¦97289 wrote,
\q1 ‘We are all descended¦97295 from just one.’
\m
\v 29 So¦97298 since we are God's offspring, we shouldn't be putting gold¦97306 or silver¦97310 or stone¦97312 craftsmanship¦97314 in the same class as the divine¦97320.
\v 30 In fact \nd God¦97333\nd* overlooked¦97331 times¦97326 of such ignorance¦97328 in the past, but now he's informing everyone¦97344 and requiring them to repent¦97345
\v 31 because he's set a date for when he's going¦97353 to be fairly judging¦97354 the world¦97357. He's already appointed the judge who everyone can have faith¦97365 in because he brought¦97366 him back to life from the dead¦97372.
\p
\v 32 When they heard¦97373 about a dead¦97376 person coming back to life, some started mocking¦97379 but others¦97381 said¦97382, “We'd like to hear¦97384 more about this from you¦97385 another time.”
\v 33 So Paul¦97394 left¦97395 at that stage
\v 34 but some people joined¦97402 with him¦97404 and believed¦97405, including Dionysius who was a council member, a woman¦97415 named Damaris¦97417, and others¦97419 as well.

\p
\v 1 After¦97424 this, Paul left Athens and travelled to Corinth.
\v 2 There he came across a Jew¦97440 named Aquila who had been born in Pontus¦97443 but who had recently¦97446 moved from Italy along with his¦97455 wife¦97454 Priscilla because¦97456 \add Emperor\add* Claudius had ordered all Jews¦97465 to leave Rome. So Paul approached¦97476 them,
\v 3 and since they worked in the same¦97484 trade¦97484, he ended up staying with them and they worked together in their craft¦97499 of tent-making.
\v 4 On every¦97511 Rest Day, Paul debated in the Jewish¦97508 meeting¦97508 hall¦97508, and was persuading¦97522 both Jews¦97527 and Greeks.
\p
\v 5 However when Silas¦97541 and¦97542 Timothy¦97544 arrived from Macedonia¦97537, Paul¦97550 was able to devote his full time to the message¦97547—demonstrating to the Jews¦97554 that \nd Yeshua¦97559\nd* is the \add promised\add* \nd messiah¦97557\nd*.
\v 6 But when they opposed¦97567 \add the message\add* and made false accusations, he \add publicly\add* brushed \add the dust\add* off his clothes¦97578\f + \fr 18:6 \ft In the culture, this was a demonstration that you're not responsible for their decision(s).\f* and said¦97580, “Your¦97585 future deaths are your own problem. I'm innocent \add of your guilt.\add* From now on, I'll going¦97599 to the non-Jews¦97598.”
\v 7 So Paul left there¦97606, and went to stay at the house of a man named Titos¦97617 Justus¦97618 who worshipped¦97619 \nd God¦97621\nd* and whose house was next-door to the meeting¦97628 hall¦97628.
\v 8 Krispo¦97629 the meeting¦97633 hall¦97633 leader¦97633 and all his¦97645 household¦97644 decided to follow the \nd master¦97639\nd*, and many of the Corinthians¦97649 believed¦97635 after they heard \add the message\add* and were immersed¦97653.
\p
\v 9 Then the \nd master¦97668\nd* spoke to Paul¦97677 one night¦97670 in a vision¦97672, “Don't be afraid and¦97684 stay silent¦97686, but¦97682 keep¦97686 speaking¦97683 out
\v 10 because I am with you and no one can mistreat¦97698 you here because there¦97702 are many of my people¦97701 in this city¦97707.”
\v 11 So Paul stayed on for eighteen months¦97719, teaching¦97721 God's message¦97726 to the people there.
\p
\v 12 Then at the time when Gallio¦97729 was the proconsul¦97733 of Achaia, the Jews¦97740 united against Paul¦97748 and¦97750 brought a case to the tribunal¦97759 against him¦97755
\v 13 saying¦97762, “This man¦97769 is going against the law by persuading¦97768 people¦97771 to be worshipping¦97772 \add his\add* \nd God¦97774\nd*.”
\p
\v 14 But as Paul¦97778 opening¦97779 his mouth¦97781 to speak, Gallio¦97784 said¦97782 to the Jews, “I would have accepted this charge if it¦97792 was a serious wrong¦97794 or evil¦97798 crime¦97797 and would have listened to you¦97807 Jews.
\v 15 However, since it's a question¦97812 about¦97815 a message¦97816 and names¦97818 and your own law, you all can see to it yourselves¦97825 because I don't¦97830 want to get involved in judging things like that.”
\v 16 So he sent them away from the tribunal¦97840,
\v 17 but they¦97851 grabbed Sosthenes, the leader¦97850 from the meeting¦97850 hall¦97850, and beat him up right there in front of the tribunal¦97854. But Gallio¦97860 took action to stop them.

\v 18 Paul¦97865 stayed on for quite a few days¦97869 after that, then he farewelled the believers¦97872 and went to Cenchrea where he had his hair cut as was the custom for someone making a vow. Then taking Priscilla and Aquila with him, he sailed towards Syria.
\v 19 When they arrived¦97896 at Ephesus¦97901, he left the other two there while he went into the Jewish¦97917 meeting¦97917 hall¦97917 and had a discussion¦97920 with the Jews¦97922 there.
\v 20 They asked him to remain¦97931 longer, but he¦97935 turned them down
\v 21 although as he gave his farewells, he said¦97941, “I'll come back here again if \nd God¦97960\nd* wills it,” then he sailed on from Ephesus¦97968.
\p
\v 22 When he landed at Caesarea¦97972, he went \add to Yerusalem\add* and greeted¦97976 the assembly¦97978 there before continuing on to Antioch¦97981.
\v 23 He stayed there for some time¦97984 before travelling through the regions¦97992 of Galatia¦97991 and¦97993 Phrygia strengthening¦97997 \add the faith of\add* the believers \add through his teaching\add*.

\p
\v 24 Meanwhile a Jewish man¦98012 named Apollos¦98005 (who had been born in \add the city of\add* Alexandria¦98008) arrived¦98014 in Ephesus¦98016. He knew the \add Hebrew\add* scriptures¦98021 well
\v 25 and had been taught¦98044 about the \nd master's¦98034\nd* way¦98031. Being¦98055 a very enthusiastic person, he started teaching¦98044 about \nd Yeshua¦98049\nd*, even though he didn't know about being¦98036 filled with the spirit¦98038.\x + \xo 18:25: \xt 2:1-4.\x*
\v 26 So Apollos started speaking¦98059 out boldly¦98059 in the Jewish¦98062 meeting¦98062 hall¦98062. Priscilla and Aquila listened to him, then asked to speak with him privately and explained¦98079 God's way¦98081 more accurately.
\v 27 Now Apollos wanted to go to Achaia, so the believers encouraged¦98126 him and sent a letter ahead of him to tell the believers there to welcome¦98132 him, so when he arrived¦98135 there, he was able to contribute¦98138 a lot to those who through God's grace¦98148 had also become believers.
\v 28 Apollos was \add also\add* able to thoroughly¦98153 refute¦98153 the arguments of the Jews¦98152 and used the scriptures¦98160 to show that \nd Yeshua¦98165\nd* is the \nd messiah¦98163\nd*.
\c 19
\s1 Many filled with the spirit in Ephesus
\rem /s1 Paul's Third Missionary Journey
\rem /s1 Paul in Ephesus
\p
\v 1 So then while Apollos¦98175 was at Corinth, Paul¦98180 travelled through¦98198 the interior regions before arriving at Ephesus¦98208. He found some followers there,
\v 2 and asked them if they had received¦98224 the holy spirit when they had \add first\add* believed¦98225 \add in Yeshua\add*.
\p They replied, “We hadn't even heard¦98240 that there's¦98239 a holy spirit.”
\p
\v 3 “So¦98251 then what were you¦98252 immersed¦98252 into?” asked Paul.
\p “With Yohan's immersion¦98261,” they¦98253 answered.
\p
\v 4 Then Paul¦98265 said, “Yohan¦98266 immersed people¦98272 \add in water\add* with an immersion¦98269 that went with repentance¦98270 \add from their sins\add*, but he told them to believe in the one who would follow him, that is to believe in \nd Yeshua¦98286\nd*.”
\p
\v 5 When the followers heard¦98287 this, they¦98290 were immersed¦98290 \add in water again, this time proclaiming their faith\add* in \nd Yeshua¦98296\nd* the \nd master¦98295\nd*.
\v 6 Then Paul¦98308 placed his hands¦98310 on them \add and prayed\add* and the holy \nd spirit¦98315\nd* came¦98313 \add down\add* onto them and they started speaking in other languages¦98325 and speaking messages from God.
\v 7 There were about¦98334 twelve¦98335 men¦98333 in the group.
\rem /s1 Paul Ministers in Ephesus
\p
\v 8 So Paul started going to the Jewish¦98343 meeting¦98343 hall¦98343 and for the next three¦98350 months¦98349 he boldly¦98347 discussed¦98351 and persuaded¦98353 them about God's kingdom¦98357.
\v 9 But as some of them refused to believe and became hardened¦98366 against his teaching and started telling everyone¦98387 that the \add Yeshua\add* way¦98371 was evil¦98369, Paul stopped teaching in the meeting hall and taught the followers at Turannos' school¦98392 instead.
\v 10 This went on for two¦98406 years¦98405 to the point that everyone in Asia \add Minor\add*, whether Jews¦98427 or Greeks, heard the message¦98422 about Yeshua.
\s1 The power of the master's message
\rem /s1 The Sons of Sceva
\p
\v 11 And \nd God¦98441\nd* was doing¦98442 incredible miracles¦98433 through Paul¦98446
\v 12 such that even if handkerchiefs¦98458 or aprons¦98461 that had touched his¦98457 skin were placed on top of any person who was sick or troubled with demons, then they would recover and the evil¦98472 spirits¦98470 would leave them.
\v 13 But some of the Jewish exorcists¦98487 going¦98484 around¦98484 attempted¦98477 to use the name¦98497 of Yeshua to drive out evil¦98495 spirits¦98493 by telling them, “I am imploring¦98504 you¦98505 all by Yeshua that Paul¦98512 preaches about.”
\v 14 Seven sons¦98529 of the Jewish chief¦98526 priest¦98526, Sceva were doing¦98534 this.
\p
\v 15 But the evil¦98571 spirit¦98569 would answer¦98565 them saying, “I know \nd Yeshua¦98576\nd* and¦98578 I recognise¦98581 Paul¦98580, but¦98583 who are you¦98582?”
\p
\v 16 Then the man¦98594 who had the evil¦98603 spirit¦98601 would jump on them and beat them up so they'd end up escaping¦98618 out of the house¦98622 naked¦98615 and wounded¦98617.
\v 17 When everyone in Ephesus¦98636 heard about this, both Jews¦98629 and Greeks were frightened, and the name¦98649 of \nd Yeshua¦98652\nd* the \nd master¦98651\nd* was being¦98647 honoured.
\v 18 Many of the people who believed¦98657 \add in Yeshua\add* came and confessed¦98660 \add their¦98665 sins\add* and wrong practices¦98664.
\v 19 Lots of the people who'd practiced¦98673 magic¦98672 brought¦98674 their¦98676 scrolls¦98677 and burnt them in front of the others. When the values of all of these were added up, it was \add huge\add*—worth around 50,000 silver¦98688 \add coins\add*.
\v 20 So that was how the \nd master's¦98701\nd* message¦98704 had a powerful¦98693 effect and¦98706 won over many people.

\rem /s1 The Riot in Ephesus
\p
\v 21 After all of this, Paul¦98717 decided in his \nd spirit¦98721\nd* that he would need to travel through¦98722 Macedonia¦98725 and Achaia enroute to Yerusalem¦98733, saying, “After I've been there¦98740 a while, I will also need to go to Rome.”
\v 22 He sent¦98747 two¦98752 of his workers, Timothy¦98759 and Eratos, to Macedonia¦98751 while he stayed on a bit longer in Asia \add Minor\add*.
\rem /s1 The Riot in Ephesus
\p
\v 23 But while he was still there, a major disturbance¦98778 hit the Yeshua followers.
\v 24 A silversmith¦98789 named Demetrius¦98784 made \add little¦98803\add* silver¦98793 shrines of Artemis¦98795 and this business¦98804 brought a tidy profit to the local craftsmen¦98800.
\v 25 Demetrius gathered all the workers¦98815 together¦98807 and told them, “Men, you¦98823 all know that our prosperity¦98830 comes from this business¦98828 of ours.
\v 26 But you've seen yourselves and heard from others that not only Ephesus¦98845, but almost¦98848 our entire¦98835 \add province of\add* Asia \add Minor\add* has become¦98871 persuaded¦98857 by this Paul¦98853 fellow, and now the crowds¦98861 are saying¦98862 that what we make are not \add real\add* gods¦98867.
\v 27 However it's not only us and our trade¦98882 that is coming into disrepute¦98886, but the temple¦98896 of the great goddess¦98893 Artemis is considered to be useless. This could result in a loss of power for the great Artemis that all of Asia \add Minor\add* and the inhabited¦98921 world¦98921 have been worshipping¦98922.”
\p
\v 28 When the gathering heard¦98924 this, they¦98935 became very angry and¦98927 yelled out, “Artemis¦98939 of the Ephesians is great!”
\v 29 Then the \add whole\add* city¦98946 was filled¦98942 with confusion¦98949 and the people rushed¦98951 to the theatre¦98957 and grabbed Gaius¦98960 and Aristarchus¦98962 from Macedonia¦98963—travelling¦98965 companions¦98965 of Paul's.
\v 30 Now Paul¦98969 wanted to go there and speak to the crowd, but the believers wouldn't let him¦98981 go.
\v 31 Also some of the leaders from Asia \add Minor\add* who were friendly¦98993 towards him, sent¦98994 messengers to him to implore¦98997 him not to go to the theatre¦99004.
\v 32 Some of the people gathered there were yelling out something, but overall it was just confusion, and¦99018 the majority of the people couldn't even tell you the reason why they¦99027 were there.
\v 33 Some people in the crowd¦99031 selected Alexander the Jew and sent him forward¦99036 to speak, so he motioned with his hand¦99048 ready to explain the situation to the people.
\v 34 But as soon as they recognised¦99055 that he was a Jew¦99059, people started yelling, “Artemis¦99075 of the Ephesians is great,” and this continued for over two¦99070 hours¦99069.
\p
\v 35 Eventually the city¦99106 administrator was able to calm the crowd¦99087 and tell them, “Men, fellow Ephesians, what person from around here doesn't know that it's Ephesus¦99093 that's the temple¦99107 keeper¦99107 of the great¦99112 Artemis¦99114 and of this image¦99117 that fell down from Zeus?
\v 36 Since all of this is unquestionable¦99118, it¦99124 makes sense for everyone to calm down and¦99128 not do anything reckless¦99130.
\v 37 These men¦99136 that you¦99133 presented here haven't stolen anything from the temple¦99141, nor have they slandered¦99144 our¦99148 goddess¦99146.
\v 38 So if Demetrius¦99153 and the silver craftsmen¦99161 with him¦99160 have a case against anyone¦99165, they should¦99173 bring it to the courts¦99168 and the proconsuls¦99171 and register the charges.
\v 39 But for the rest of you, if you have a grievance against others¦99176, it¦99191 needs to be settled¦99191 in a lawful¦99188 assembly¦99190
\v 40 because we're in danger¦99194 of being charged with insurrection¦99197 about what happened today¦99200. And we would have no defence that we could respond with concerning this disorderly¦99215 gathering¦99215.” Then he told them all to go home.

\v 1 After all the commotion¦99228 had died down, Paul¦99232 sent¦99229 for the believers, and after¦99223 greeting¦99240 and encouraging them, he left¦99242 \add Ephesus\add* to go to Macedonia¦99247.\f + \fr 20:1 \ft As he'd already decided—see 19:21.\f*
\v 2 As he travelled through¦99248 the districts¦99252, he challenged the people there with a lot of messages, until he eventually arrived in Greece.
\v 3 He'd been there about three¦99269 months¦99268 when he heard about a plot by some Jews¦99278 to waylay him as he boarded a ship to return to Syria, so instead he decided to return through¦99296 Macedonia¦99298
\v 4 with Sopater son of Pyrrhus¦99311 from Berea, Aristarchus¦99315 and Secundus from Thessalonica¦99313, Gaius¦99319 from Derbe, Tychicus and Trophimus from the province of Asia \add Minor\add*, and Timothy¦99323 all accompanying¦99299 him¦99304.
\v 5 They went ahead and waited for us\f + \fr 20:5 \ft Luke (the writer) includes himself here.\f* at Troas.
\v 6 So we sailed¦99342 out from Philippi after the Feast of Flat Bread. We arrived and meet the others there at Troas after a five-day trip, and then stayed¦99367 on there for seven¦99369 days.

\v 7 On the Sunday we had gathered¦99378 together to break¦99383 bread¦99384 together and Paul¦99386 was discussing¦99387 many things with them. As he was scheduled to leave the next day, the meeting went on towards midnight¦99398
\v 8 and there¦99399 were many lamps¦99402 in the upper¦99406 room where¦99407 we¦99408 had all gathered¦99410.
\v 9 Now there was a young¦99415 man¦99415 named Eutychus who was sitting¦99411 on the window¦99421 sill, and as Paul¦99430 went on, he fell asleep and toppled down from the third¦99441 storey. The ones who reached him first thought he was dead¦99446,
\v 10 but Paul¦99450 had come¦99447 downstairs and bent over Eutychus and held him in his¦99466 arms and said¦99460 to the crowd, “Don't worry, he's still alive.”
\v 11 Then Paul went back up and broke¦99473 the bread¦99475 with the others, eating a little and continuing to talk with them until¦99483 leaving at daybreak¦99484.
\v 12 The locals took the young man home and¦99497 were very relieved that he was alive.

\p
\v 13 We went ahead to the ship¦99509 and departed for Assos¦99514 where it had been arranged that we'd pick up Paul¦99519 because¦99521 he wanted to walk there¦99515.
\v 14 So when we met him at Assos¦99540, he boarded the ship and we all sailed on to Mitylene.
\v 15 After we left Mitylene, we were out from Kios the next day, in Samos¦99560 the day after that, and then the following day we arrived at Miletus.
\v 16 Paul¦99576 had decided to sail¦99577 past Ephesus¦99579 because¦99593 he was hurrying¦99592 to try to get the Yerusalem¦99607 for the Day of Pentecost so he didn't want to spend¦99586 time¦99586 in Asia \add Minor\add*.

\rem /s1 Paul Speaks to the Ephesian Elders
\rem /s1 Paul's Farewell Speech to the Elders of Ephesus
\p
\v 17 So while we were at Miletus, he sent¦99613 a message to Ephesus¦99615 for the elders¦99619 of the assembly¦99621 to come to him.
\v 18 When they arrived¦99624, he told them, “You all know that from the very first¦99640 day¦99641 that I set foot¦99645 in Asia \add Minor\add* and for the entire¦99636 time¦99662 that I was there
\v 19 I humbly served the \nd master¦99667\nd* even through tears¦99675 and trials¦99677 when the Jews¦99686 plotted to destroy me.
\v 20 But I didn't shrink back from teaching you everything that would help you, whether I was teaching in public¦99700 or in individual homes¦99703.
\v 21 I explained to both Jews¦99708 and Greeks how they needed to turn their backs on their sins and towards \nd God¦99715\nd* with faith¦99718 in our¦99726 \nd master¦99724 Yeshua¦99727\nd* the \nd messiah¦99729\nd*.
\p
\v 22 However the \nd spirit¦99738\nd* is now forcing me towards Yerusalem¦99741 even though I don't¦99751 know what will happen to me there.
\v 23 I just know that recently in every¦99761 city¦99763, the holy \nd spirit¦99757\nd* tells me that chains and¦99772 hardships are waiting for me.
\v 24 But I've never regarded my own life as being valuable—I only want to reach the end of my life having served in the way that the \nd master¦99817 Yeshua¦99818\nd* instructed me to speak out the good message¦99824 about God's grace¦99826.
\p
\v 25 So you see, I know that all of you from here where I passed¦99847 through¦99847 proclaiming¦99848 God's kingdom¦99850, you will never see me again.
\v 26 That's why I'm declaring to all of you¦99859 today¦99863 that I'm not guilty of your judgement
\v 27 because I didn't avoid telling you¦99887 anything that I had from \nd God¦99885\nd*.
\v 28 So now you elders look after your own lives and those of your flock¦99895 because the holy \nd spirit¦99900\nd* chose you as overseers¦99905 to shepherd¦99906 the assembly¦99908 of God's people who he paid for with his very own blood¦99919.
\v 29 I'm aware that after¦99929 I leave, vicious wolves¦99934 will come in amongst¦99936 you¦99937 and trying to steal the flock¦99941.
\v 30 Even some of you¦99944 will rise up and¦99942 teach a message that's warped but which will draw some of the believers away to follow it,
\v 31 so take great care. Remember that for three¦99962 years, I never stopped warning each of you along with my tears¦99971
\v 32 so now I am leaving you all in God's hands and with the message¦99988 of his¦99991 grace¦99990 which¦99992 is quite capable of helping you grow to receive the inheritance¦100001 that's for all those who've been purified.
\p
\v 33 I never envied anyone's gold¦100013 or silver¦100010 or \add fancy\add* clothes¦100015
\v 34 and you¦100021 yourselves¦100019 know that I laboured with my own hands¦100037 to cover my expenses and for those with me.
\v 35 Yes, I showed¦100043 you all that it's good to work and to take care of the weaker ones and to remember¦100053 the message¦100056 of the \nd master¦100058 Yeshua¦100059\nd* when he said¦100063 that it's better to be a giver than a taker.”
\p
\v 36 When he'd finished speaking, Paul knelt¦100076 down and prayed¦100083 with them all.
\v 37 Everyone¦100098 was sobbing as they¦100099 hugged and¦100092 kissed him¦100100
\v 38 because¦100103 what he had said about never seeing him again had really distressed¦100101 them. Then they accompanied¦100119 him to his¦100117 ship¦100125.

\p
\v 1 When it¦100129 was time for us to sail, we¦100145 left them and sailed directly across to Cos before going on to Rhodes the next day¦100150 and then on to Patara¦100159.
\v 2 From there we found¦100163 a ship¦100164 heading to Phoenicia, so we boarded¦100168 that and set off.
\v 3 After sighting Cyprus and then leaving it¦100177 behind on our left, we sailed on to Syria and docked there¦100187 at the port of Tyre¦100186 where the ship¦100191 had cargo¦100195 to be unloaded¦100193.
\v 4 We searched for the believers there¦100203 and then stayed on with them for seven¦100205 days¦100204. They were inspired by the \nd spirit¦100213\nd* to tell Paul¦100208 not to go to Yerusalem¦100220.
\v 5 Once our time was up there and everyone knew that we¦100230 were leaving, even the wives¦100235 and children¦100237 accompanied¦100231 us out of the city¦100241 to the port. We all knelt¦100243 on the beach and prayed¦100251
\v 6 before we continued on and boarded our ship¦100263 and they went¦100259 back to their¦100268 own homes¦100269.
\p
\v 7 So we sailed from Tyre¦100276 down to Ptolemais¦100280 where we were able to greet¦100283 the brothers¦100285 and sisters¦100285 and stay overnight with them.
\v 8 The next day¦100292 we continued on to Caesarea¦100304 and ended up in Philip's house¦100309. He was one of the \add original\add* seven¦100317 \add men who had been given the responsibility of distributing aid\add*—a preacher¦100312 of the good¦100312 message¦100312, and we stayed with him¦100320.
\v 9 Philip had four¦100327 unmarried daughters¦100325 still at home, and they shared messages from God.
\v 10 Several days¦100334 later a man named Agabus came¦100336 from Yudea¦100340. He too shared messages from God
\v 11 and when he arrived, he picked up Paul's belt and tied it around his own feet and hands, telling them that the holy \nd spirit¦100373\nd* had told him that this is how the owner of the belt would be treated by the Jewish leaders in Yerusalem¦100387 before they would then hand him over to the non-Jews¦100397 to be dealt with.
\p
\v 12 When we heard¦100400 this described, both we and the locals¦100408 begged Paul not to go to Yerusalem¦100417
\v 13 but he answered¦100419, “Oh come on, what's all this weeping¦100431 and carrying on that's breaking¦100434 my¦100435 heart¦100437. Actually I'm quite ready¦100450 not only to be tied up, but even to be killed in Yerusalem¦100449 as a testimony to the \nd master¦100458 Yeshua¦100459\nd*.”
\p
\v 14 When we saw that we couldn't change his mind, we didn't say anything else, figuring out that whatever the \nd master¦100471\nd* wills for the situation would happen,
\rem /s1 Paul Arrives at Jerusalem
\v 15 and so after¦100479 these¦100484 several days¦100483, we¦100490 had gotten everything ready and started off for Yerusalem¦100494.
\v 16 Some of the believers from Caesarea¦100502 accompanied us and led us to the home of a man named Mnason to stay—he was an older believer from Cyprus.

\rem /s1 Paul's Arrival at Jerusalem
\p
\v 17 When we arrived at Yerusalem¦100520, the brothers¦100526 and¦100526 sisters¦100526 there happily welcomed¦100522 us,
\v 18 and the next day¦100527, we accompanied Paul¦100536 to go and see Yacob\f + \fr 21:18 \ft Yacob is commonly (but wrongly) called James in most older English Bibles.\f* and the elders¦100545 of the assembly there.
\v 19 After greeting¦100549 them, Paul then described all the things that \nd God¦100565\nd* had done among the non-Jews¦100568 as he had served among them,
\v 20 and when they'd heard¦100575 all that they praised¦100576 \nd God¦100579\nd* and told Paul, “Brother, you've noticed how many thousands¦100589 of Jews¦100594 have believed¦100598 \add in the messiah\add* but they still strive to observe¦100586 the \add Moses'\add* laws.
\v 21 But they've heard reports that you've been teaching¦100612 the Jews¦100621 that live outside our country that they don't have to obey what Moses \add wrote\add*—telling them that they don't have to have their¦100628 children¦100629 circumcised¦100626 and that they don't have to follow our \add Jewish\add* customs¦100634.
\v 22 What will happen \add now\add*, because \add the leaders here\add* will certainly hear¦100646 that you¦100649 have arrived?
\v 23 So¦100651 here's what we¦100655 suggest that you¦100654 do: Four of our men are making a \add public\add* vow.
\v 24 Why don't you join these¦100665 four and join them in the purification¦100667 ceremony \add at the temple\add* and pay their expenses in getting your heads shaved. Then everyone will be able to see that it's false what they've heard about¦100691 you, because¦100673 you \add clearly\add* still comply with \add Moses'\add* instructions¦100690.
\v 25 And as for the believers¦100710 who are non-Jews¦100711, we've informed them of our recommendation that they should avoid anything that's been offered to an idol¦100735, avoid consuming blood¦100738 and meat from strangled¦100740 animals¦100740 and birds, and avoid sexual¦100742 immorality¦100742.”
\rem /s1 Paul Is Arrested
\p
\v 26 So the next day¦100752 Paul¦100745 took the \add four\add* men¦100748 for the purification¦100755 ceremony in the temple¦100760 and there they announced¦100761 the date when their vows would be fulfilled¦100763 and their sacrifices made.

\p
\v 27 When the seven¦100784 days¦100786 \add of the vow\add* were almost over, some Jews¦100795 from \add the province of\add* Asia \add Minor\add* noticed Paul in the temple¦100801. They stirred up the crowd¦100811 and grabbed hold of him,
\v 28 yelling out, “Men of Israel. Help us here. This is the man¦100831 who's been teaching¦100849 all around the world against Israel and against \add Moses'\add* law and against this temple. What's more he brought¦100854 non-Jews here into the temple and so has defiled¦100861 this holy place.”
\v 29 (\add They said this\add* because they had previously¦100869 seen¦100869 Trophimus from Ephesus¦100872 in the city¦100875 with Paul¦100887 and had assumed that he had brought¦100885 him into the temple¦100884.)
\p
\v 30 So now the whole¦100892 city¦100891 was in an uproar, and the crowds rushed in, grabbed Paul¦100901, and dragged¦100902 him¦100903 out of the temple and hurriedly closed the temple gates.
\v 31 They were ready to kill¦100919 Paul, but the commander¦100923 of the Roman soldiers had heard that all Yerusalem¦100930 was in an uproar.
\v 32 Taking some soldiers and officers, he immediately¦100932 ran down to the temple, and when the crowd saw the commander¦100946 and the soldiers they stopped beating Paul¦100954.
\v 33 The commander¦100959 came close and took¦100960 hold of Paul and ordered that he be tied up with a pair of chains¦100965 while he tried to find out who he was and what he'd done wrong.
\v 34 Various people in the crowd¦100986 were shouting out different things, and not being able to make any sense of it because¦100996 of all the commotion¦100998, the commander¦100999 ordered that Paul be taken into the barracks¦101004.
\v 35 When they got to the stairs¦101011, the soldiers¦101019 had to lift him¦101016 up above their heads because¦101020 of the frenzy of the crowd¦101025,
\v 36 because most of the people¦101031 were following¦101026 and shouting out, “Do away with him¦101036!”
\s1 Paul's defence

\rem /s1 Paul Speaks to the Crowd
\p
\v 37 As they were able to carry him into the fortress, Paul¦101044 called down to the commander, “Can I say¦101054 something¦101055 to you¦101057?”
\p “You speak Greek!”, replied the commander.
\v 38 “Aren't you¦101065 the Egyptian who stirred up a group of assassins¦101084 a while back and led them out into the wilderness¦101079?”
\p
\v 39 “No, I'm a Jew from Tarsus¦101096 in Cilica—a citizen¦101104 of an important city¦101103,” said¦101085 Paul¦101088. “But please, let me speak¦101112 to these people¦101115.”
\p
\v 40 The commander nodded, so the soldiers stood¦101125 Paul on the stairs¦101128 where he gestured¦101131 to the people¦101136. The crowd quietened down, and so Paul spoke loudly in his¦101117 Hebrew language¦101150:
\c 22
\nb
\v 1 “Men, brothers¦101153, and¦101154 fathers¦101155, listen¦101156 to what I have to say for myself.”
\v 2 When they heard¦101164 him speaking Hebrew, they became even more quiet¦101175 as he continued,
\v 3 “I am a Jew who grew up in this very city¦101197 to study under Gamaliel¦101202. I've been raised according¦101206 to every part of our¦101208 ancestral¦101209 law, working hard to obey \nd God¦101214\nd* like all of you¦101218 here today¦101221.
\v 4 I used to persecute¦101227 the followers of ‘The Path’ even to death¦101230—tying up both men and women¦101240 and handing them over to the prisons¦101235
\v 5 as the Chief Priest and all the council¦101254 of elders¦101254 can tell \add you\add*.

\v 6 “But one time as I was travelling and¦101287 getting close to Damascus¦101290 by the middle of the day, suddenly¦101295 a bright light¦101303 from the sky¦101299 began to flash¦101300 around me
\v 7 and¦101314 I fell to the ground¦101313. I heard¦101315 a voice¦101316 asking me, ‘Saul, Saul, why are you¦101325 persecuting¦101325 me?’
\v 8 ‘Who are you, master¦101333?’ I answered¦101328. And the voice said¦101334, ‘I am \nd Yeshua¦101343\nd*—the one from Nazareth¦101345 that you are persecuting¦101348.’
\v 9 The other¦101363 people with me saw¦101357 the light¦101356 but didn't hear the voice¦101364 that spoke to me.
\v 10 Then I asked, ‘What do I need to do, master?’ ‘Get up and continue into Damascus¦101385,’ the master said. ‘When you get there¦101386, you'll be told everything that you've been assigned to do.’
\v 11 But I couldn't see anything because¦101402 the brightness of the light¦101406 \add had affected my eyes\add*, so my companions had to lead me by hand¦101408 into Damascus¦101416.
\p
\v 12 “In Damascus there was a man¦101420 named Ananias¦101417—a \add non-Jew\add* but who was respected by the Jews¦101432 there because he strove to obey \add Moses'\add* instructions about living¦101431.
\v 13 Ananias came to where I was and standing by me said¦101439, “Brother Saul¦101441, receive¦101443 your sight¦101443?” That very hour¦101447 I was able to see again and look at him¦101451
\v 14 and he said¦101454, ‘The \nd god¦101456\nd* of our¦101459 ancestors¦101458 has decided in advance to reveal his¦101466 plans to you, and for you to see¦101468 the sinless one—to hear¦101472 him speaking
\v 15 because¦101481 he wants you to inform people¦101484 everywhere what you've seen¦101487 and heard¦101489.
\v 16 So what else are you waiting¦101493 for? Get up and wash away your¦101500 sins¦101499 by getting immersed¦101495 \add in water\add* as you request his¦101506 forgiveness.’

\v 17 “Then when I returned¦101510 to Yerusalem¦101512 and¦101513 was praying¦101514 in the temple¦101518, I fell into a trance¦101522
\v 18 and saw \add the master\add* telling me, ‘Get out of Yerusalem¦101535 in a hurry because¦101536 they¦101538 won't accept¦101538 what you're teaching them about me.’
\v 19 ‘\nd Master¦101546\nd*,’ I replied, ‘they¦101547 know that previously I was the one imprisoning¦101552 and¦101553 beating¦101554 the people who believed¦101559 in you¦101561,
\v 20 and when Stephen was killed after teaching about you¦101571, it was me standing there and cheering on the ones executing him¦101588 as I held their coats for them.’
\v 21 Then \add the master\add* told me, ‘Get going¦101594 now because¦101595 I'm sending¦101601 you¦101603 away to the non-Jews¦101598.’ ”

\p
\v 22 Until this point in his message¦101611, the crowd had been listening to Paul, but now they started shouting, “Do away with this man¦101623! He doesn't deserve to live in this world!”
\v 23 Then they yelled and threw some of their¦101637 clothes¦101638 down onto the ground and threw dust up into the air.
\rem /s1 Paul Reveals His Roman Citizenship
\v 24 So the commander¦101649 ordered Paul to be brought¦101650 inside into barracks¦101655 and ordered that he be flogged¦101658 and interrogated¦101659 to determine what he'd done that would make the crowd react like that.
\v 25 But as they strapped¦101682 him down and stretched¦101677 him out for the flogging¦101701, Paul¦101690 asked the centurion¦101687 standing there, “It is legal for you to flog a Roman citizen who hasn't even been tried?”
\p
\v 26 When he heard¦101703 that, the centurion¦101706 went to the commander¦101715 and reported¦101717, “How are we going¦101722 to handle this, because this man¦101726 is a Roman citizen?”
\p
\v 27 So the commander¦101734 went in to where Paul was and asked him¦101737, “Tell me the truth. Are you¦101742 a Roman citizen?”
\p “Yes I am,” said¦101736 Paul.
\p
\v 28 “Yeah, and¦101754 I paid a lot for mine as well,” mocked the commander¦101757.
\p “Actually mine is through birth,” Paul¦101772 responded.
\p
\v 29 At this point, the soldiers who were about to interrogate¦101788 Paul left the room, and even the commander¦101791 was now afraid¦101793 after learning¦101794 that he had had a Roman citizen tied down to be flogged.

\v 30 The next day¦101804, the Roman commander¦101824 still wanted to know¦101808 what was behind the anger of the Jews¦101817, so he had Paul released¦101818 from the cell, but brought¦101836 him down to a room where he had ordered the chief¦101828 priests¦101828 and the Jewish council¦101833 to convene.

\c 23

\v 1 and looking directly at the council¦101847 members said¦101850, “Men, brothers¦101852, all my life I have lived¦101857 before \nd God¦101859\nd* as a good¦101856 citizen¦101857 and with a clean conscience¦101855.”
\v 2 But Ananias¦101867 the chief¦101866 priest¦101866 commanded¦101869 one of his¦101874 companions to whack Paul on the mouth¦101876.
\v 3 “\nd God¦101890\nd* will strike¦101886 you,” said¦101885 Paul¦101879, “you grand show-off. You've been brought here to judge me as someone who knows the law and yet you violate¦101902 the law by commanding¦101903 that I be hit in the face.”
\p
\v 4 But the others standing there said¦101909, “Are you¦101915 insulting¦101915 God's chief¦101912 priest¦101912?”
\p
\v 5 “Brothers¦101922,” said Paul¦101919, “I didn't realise that he's the chief¦101925 priest¦101925, because¦101927 the scriptures teach us not to speak¦101934 wrongly¦101935 of our leaders.”

\v 6 But then, knowing¦101936 that the council¦101954 consisted of some from the sect of the Sadducees¦101945 and some from the Pharisees' party, Paul¦101939 continued loudly, “Men, brothers¦101956, like my father, I'm a member¦101958 of the Pharisees and I'm being¦101969 tried today concerning¦101963 the hope and the resurrection¦101966 of the dead¦101967!”
\p
\v 7 Well, as soon as he said this, the council was split as the Pharisees and the Sadducees¦101986 started arguing.
\v 8 (Sadducees¦101992 say that the dead don't come back to life, and there's no messengers¦102001 and no spirits¦102003, but the Pharisees believe there is.)
\v 9 So then there was a big kerfuffle because some of the teachers¦102019 of the law spoke up for the Pharisees saying¦102028, “We don't see anything wrong with this man¦102034. Maybe it was a spirit¦102038 or one \add of God's\add* messengers¦102042 that spoke to him.”
\p
\v 10 But the \add Roman\add* commander¦102056 was afraid¦102053 that they might tear Paul apart¦102058 in the big argument, so he called for his soldiers to come¦102068 down to uplift Paul and return him to the barracks¦102080.
\p
\v 11 The following¦102083 night¦102084, the \nd master¦102088\nd* appeared to Paul and told him¦102086, “Be brave because¦102093 just like you testified¦102094 about me here in Yerusalem¦102100, so too you'll tell them about me in Rome.”

\rem /s1 The Plan to Kill Paul
\rem /s1 The Plot to Kill Paul
\p
\v 12 The next day¦102111, some of the Jews¦102121 gathered¦102115 informally and pledged not to eat¦102128 or drink¦102130 until¦102132 they'd killed Paul¦102140.
\v 13 There were more than forty¦102144 of them in this conspiracy¦102150,
\v 14 and they approached¦102154 the chief¦102156 priests¦102156 and elders¦102159 and told them, “We've¦102162 made an oath to taste¦102166 nothing¦102165 until¦102169 we've killed Paul¦102174, otherwise we'll bring a curse¦102162 on ourselves¦102164.
\v 15 So¦102176 you guys assemble the council¦102191 and report¦102186 to the commander¦102188 so that he'll bring¦102195 him down to you all as if you need more information about his actions, and then we'll have an opportunity to kill¦102219 before¦102211 he gets here.
\p
\v 16 But a nephew of Paul had heard¦102225 about this ambush¦102234 and¦102237 went in to the barracks¦102242 to inform Paul.
\v 17 Paul¦102249 then called¦102246 one of the Roman centurions¦102252 and told him to take the young¦102256 man¦102256 to the commander¦102262 because¦102264 he had something¦102267 to tell him.
\v 18 So¦102271 the centurion took him to the commander¦102277, explaining, “The prisoner¦102281 Paul¦102282, called¦102283 me and asked¦102285 me to bring this young¦102288 man¦102288 to you because he has something¦102294 to report to you.”
\p
\v 19 The commander¦102304 took the young man by the hand¦102301 and led him¦102302 into his¦102302 private office and asked, “What do you¦102314 have to tell me?”
\p
\v 20 “The Jews¦102321 have decided¦102322 to ask¦102324 you,”, he said¦102317, “that tomorrow¦102327 you bring¦102330 Paul¦102329 down to the council¦102333 as if they wanted to question him further.
\v 21 But don't¦102349 listen to them because¦102353 over forty¦102359 of their¦102355 men¦102357 will be lying¦102352 in wait for him, and they have sworn not to eat¦102364 or drink¦102366 until¦102368 they've killed him. In fact, they're all set up already, just waiting¦102378 for your consent.”
\p
\v 22 The commander¦102386 told the young¦102389 man¦102389 not to tell anyone¦102392 else about the ambush and dismissed him.

\p
\v 23 Then the commander called¦102401 in two of his centurions¦102406 and ordered them to prepare two-hundred soldiers to travel as far as Caesarea¦102414, supported by seventy¦102417 mounted soldiers and two-hundred more with spears¦102419. They were to be ready to leave by 9pm,
\v 24 along with a horse for Paul¦102433 to ride, and were to get him safely¦102434 to Governor Felix.
\v 25 Then the commander wrote¦102455 a letter¦102458 ready to take:
\p
\v 26 “Greetings to the most excellent¦102471 Governor Felix from Claudius Lysias.
\v 27 I'm writing to you about this man¦102476 who had been captured¦102481 by the Jews¦102484 here and they were about to kill him when I moved in with my soldiers because he is a Roman citizen.
\v 28 I wanted to know¦102510 what they were accusing him of, so I took him down to their¦102524 council¦102523 meeting,
\v 29 but¦102536 I discovered that it was just some detail about their¦102534 \add Jewish\add* law and nothing¦102535 that should result in death¦102538 or imprisonment.
\v 30 Then when I learnt that they have a plot to try to ambush and kill him, I sent¦102559 him immediately¦102556 to you, and I'll order his accusers¦102565 to bring their case before¦102571 you.”
\p
\v 31 So¦102576 the soldiers¦102577 carried out their instructions and took Paul¦102584 as far as Antipatris¦102591 during the night¦102588.
\v 32 The next morning the foot soldiers returned¦102603 to the barracks¦102606, leaving the mounted soldiers to take him¦102601 on
\v 33 to Caesarea¦102611, where they¦102618 presented¦102618 Paul¦102621 to the governor¦102617 along with the letter¦102615.
\v 34 After reading the letter the governor asked¦102628 Paul what province¦102632 that he's from and found out that he was from Cilicia.
\v 35 Then he ordered Paul to be kept under guard¦102663 \add in the prison\add* in Herod's¦102662 palace until he would hear¦102643 from him in the future once his accusers¦102649 got there.

\p
\v 1 Five days¦102669 later, Ananias¦102673 the chief¦102672 priest¦102672 arrived along with some elders¦102676 and¦102678 an attorney¦102679 named Tertullos¦102680, to bring the charges against¦102686 Paul¦102688 before Governor \add Felix\add*.
\v 2 Once he was called¦102689 to speak, Tertullos¦102695 began¦102692 his¦102691 accusation¦102693 of Paul:
\p “We have seen peace¦102698 under your rule and the helpful reforms¦102703 that this nation¦102707 has experienced through your provision¦102712,
\v 3 most excellent¦102718 Felix¦102719, and we¦102717 gratefully welcome¦102717 everything you've done and everywhere you've done it¦102717.
\v 4 But in order¦102723 not to oblige you longer than necessary, in your gentleness¦102738 we request you to listen¦102732 to our brief¦102735 statement.
\v 5 This man¦102742 here has been found¦102739 to be a troublemaker, stirring¦102747 up riots among the Jews¦102752 throughout the inhabited¦102756 world¦102756, and as a ring-leader of the Nazarite sect
\v 6 he even attempted¦102767 to profane¦102768 the temple¦102766 where we¦102771 were able to arrest him.
\v 7 ≈
\v 8 When you examine¦102803 him yourself¦102802 you'll discover all these¦102806 things that we're accusing¦102810 him of.”
\v 9 The Jews¦102817 who had come also affirmed all the accusations.
\s1 Paul's defence against the accusations
\rem /s1 Paul's Defense before Felix
\p
\v 10 So the governor¦102830 nodded¦102827 for Paul¦102826 to speak¦102831 and he started,
\p “I happily defend¦102847 myself¦102846 today knowing that you have many years¦102834 of experience ruling \add in this region\add*.
\v 11 You can quickly establish that it was less than twelve¦102859 days¦102857 ago that I arrived in Yerusalem¦102867 to worship there¦102855.
\v 12 They never found¦102874 me in the temple¦102873 arguing with anyone¦102877 or stirring up the crowd¦102883, and nor was I doing that in the Jewish¦102887 meeting¦102887 halls¦102887 or anywhere in the city¦102891
\v 13 and so they can't provide evidence to you¦102897 to support any of their accusations¦102903.
\v 14 However, I must confess¦102905 that I follow ‘The Path’ that they¦102914 call a sect which¦102913 serves the \nd God¦102920\nd* of our ancestors¦102919 and¦102927 believes¦102921 everything in \add Moses'\add* law as well as the writings of the prophets¦102931.
\v 15 We put our trust in the same God that they themselves¦102941 follow, and we all anticipate a resurrection¦102944 of those who serve God and those who don't.
\v 16 Because of this, I also strive to maintain a clean conscience¦102959 in everything¦102969, before \nd God¦102964\nd* and¦102965 the people¦102967.
\p
\v 17 After several years¦102971 away, I arrived¦102981 \add in Yerusalem\add* bringing offerings¦102983 to help my¦102980 own people and¦102982 before God.
\v 18 That was when they¦102987 found¦102987 me in the temple¦102992 after going through the purification¦102989 ceremony, and without either a crowd¦102995 or a commotion¦102998 around me.
\v 19 But there were some Jews¦103005 from \add the province of\add* Asia \add Minor\add* who are the ones who should be appearing here before¦103009 you¦103010, and¦103012 they should be the ones accusing¦103013 me if they could find anything¦103015 against¦103017 me.
\v 20 Even these¦103023 ones here now should¦103024 explain what their council¦103035 found¦103027 me guilty of,
\v 21 other than my calling out that I was being¦103053 judged¦103053 because I believe in the resurrection¦103050 of the dead¦103051.
\p
\v 22 But Felix who was already familiar with followers of ‘The Path’, announced that the trial would be adjourned until Commander Lysias arrived when he would investigate¦103080 further.
\v 23 He ordered the centurion¦103088 to keep Paul confined, but under relaxed¦103095 conditions and allowing any of his¦103101 friends to bring him anything he needed.
\s1 Paul speaks to the governor and his wife
\rem /s1 Paul Held in Custody
\rem /s1 Paul before Felix and Drusilla
\p
\v 24 However, several days¦103108 later Felix returned there, \add this time\add* with his wife¦103118 Drusilla who was Jewish. He sent¦103123 for Paul¦103125 and¦103126 listened to him¦103128 explain about faith¦103135 in the \nd messiah¦103132\nd*.
\v 25 But when the subject turned to righteousness¦103140 and self-control¦103143 and the coming¦103149 judgement, Felix became very uncomfortable and told him, “That's enough for now. If I have time in the future, I'll send for you.”
\v 26 However he was also hoping¦103171 that Paul¦103178 would give him money¦103173, so he often sent for him and spoke with him.
\p
\v 27 This went on for two¦103190 years¦103190, until Felix was replaced as governor by Porcius Festus, but wanting¦103199 to stay in the good books of the Jews¦103205, Felix left Paul¦103211 confined.

\s1 Tried yet again, Paul appeals to Caesar

\rem /s1 Paul Appears before Festus
\rem /s1 The Trial Before Festus
\p
\v 1 After Festus had been in the area for three¦103220 days¦103221, he made the uphill trip from Caesarea¦103226 to Yerusalem¦103224.
\v 2 There the chief¦103234 priests¦103234 and the Jewish leaders¦103237 repeated their case against¦103240 Paul¦103242, and they¦103244 implored¦103244 Festus,
\v 3 asking as a special favour¦103247, that he would order Paul to be sent to Yerusalem¦103256 (because¦103252 they wanted to ambush¦103257 and kill¦103259 him on the way¦103263).
\v 4 But Festus replied that he'd keep Paul¦103271 in Caesarea¦103274 and¦103277 he was heading back there soon,
\v 5 so he told them, “Some of your leaders can go there with me, and if the man¦103298 has done anything¦103293 wrong, they can explain their accusations¦103301 there.”
\p
\v 6 After staying seven or eight¦103312 days¦103307 in Yerusalem, Festus and company travelled back to Caesarea¦103317, and the next day¦103319 he sat¦103321 at the judge's bench and ordered that Paul¦103327 be brought¦103329 in.
\v 7 When he arrived¦103330, the Jews¦103339 who had come¦103338 from Yerusalem¦103337 stood¦103333 facing Paul and¦103341 presented many heavy¦103342 charges¦103343 which¦103350 they¦103352 weren't able to prove.
\v 8 Paul¦103356 defended¦103357 himself, stating that he had not sinned¦103374 against any Jewish law or against the temple¦103369, nor against any Roman law.
\p
\v 9 However, Festus wanted to be able to grant¦103385 a favour¦103383 to the Jews¦103381, so in response to Paul¦103388 he asked, “Are you willing¦103390 to be returned to Yerusalem¦103392 so that I can judge¦103398 you about these¦103396 things there¦103394?”
\p
\v 10 “I'm here facing Caesar's representative,” Paul¦103404 replied. “and it's quite appropriate¦103414 for me to be judged¦103415 here. I've done nothing¦103417 wrong¦103419 to these Jews¦103416 as you¦103422 can no doubt see for yourself.
\v 11 If I had done anything wrong¦103430, anything worthy¦103432 of the death sentence, then I'm ready to accept death. On the other¦103441 hand, if none of their accusations¦103446 are true, no one can hand me over to them. I appeal to Caesar.”
\p
\v 12 So the Festus conferred with his legal counsel¦103463 and answered¦103464, “Well, you've appealed¦103466 to Caesar so you'll go to Caesar!”

\p
\v 13 Several days¦103470 later, King Agrippa¦103474 and¦103477 \add his sister\add* Bernice¦103478 arrived¦103479 in Caesarea¦103482 to meet Festus.
\v 14 As they¦103491 \add had planned to\add* stay on for a few days¦103490, Festus mentioned about Paul¦103502 to the king¦103497, telling him, “There's¦103506 a prisoner¦103510 here that Felix left behind.
\v 15 When I was in Yerusalem¦103516, the chief¦103520 priests¦103520 and¦103521 Jewish elders¦103523 reported¦103517 to me, wanting a conviction¦103529 of this man.
\v 16 I told them that it's not the Roman way to convict someone until they've been able to face¦103551 their accusers and¦103557 make their defence¦103558 against the accusations.
\v 17 So¦103564 as soon as they arrived here, on the very next day¦103572 I sat¦103574 on the judge's bench and ordered the man¦103581 to be brought¦103579 in
\v 18 that they were accusing¦103586, but they didn't raise even one of the charges¦103588 that I expected.
\v 19 Instead they¦103605 raised some issues about their¦103602 own beliefs and¦103609 about some dead person called \nd Yeshua¦103612\nd* that Paul¦103617 reckoned was still living¦103618.
\v 20 I was puzzled about this debate¦103627 and asked him if he wanted to be judged¦103637 about these things in Yerusalem¦103635.
\v 21 But Paul¦103642 appealed¦103643 to be kept safe from them until he could face the emperor, so I ordered him to be kept \add in prison\add* until I can send him to Rome.
\p
\v 22 “I'd quite like to hear him myself¦103670,” Agrippa¦103662 said.
\rem /s1 Paul Before Agrippa

\rem /s1 Paul Speaks to Agrippa
\p “Well, tomorrow,” replied Festus, “you'll be able to hear from him.”
\p
\v 23 So¦103681 the next day¦103680, \add King\add* Agrippa¦103685 and Bernice¦103688 formally arrived with all their attendants and entered the auditorium¦103697 to greet the commanders¦103701 and the prominent¦103706 men¦103703 of the city¦103709, and then Festus ordered for Paul¦103716 to be brought¦103714 in.
\v 24 Festus started, “King Agrippa¦103721 and everyone present¦103726, observe¦103729 the prisoner who a multitude¦103736 of Jews¦103738 pleaded¦103739 with me about both in Yerusalem¦103744 and here, that he doesn't deserve to still be alive.
\v 25 But I haven't discovered anything that he's done that's worthy¦103760 of a death¦103762 sentence, and since he himself¦103766 appealed¦103771 to the emperor, I judged¦103774 that that's where he should be sent.
\v 26 The problem is that I don't¦103785 have any charge to write to my master¦103784 and so I've brought¦103789 the prisoner out in front of you so that after you examine¦103801 him, I might have something¦103805 I can write,
\v 27 because it¦103811 doesn't seem logical to me to transport a prisoner¦103813 \add to Rome\add* if there's no charges¦103819 specified against¦103817 him¦103818.
\c 26

\rem /s1 Paul Defends Himself before Agrippa
\p
\v 1 So then Agrippa¦103821 told Paul, “Ok, you¦103828 can give your side now then.”
\m So Paul gestured with his hand¦103839 and began:
\p
\v 2 “Concerning¦103841 all the charges which¦103843 have been brought against me by the Jews¦103846, King Agrippa¦103848, I consider¦103849 myself¦103850 fortunate
\v 3 because you're an expert on Jewish customs¦103873 and issues, so I ask you to listen¦103882 to me patiently¦103881.
\p
\v 4 “All the Jews¦103906 know about my early life, from my upbringing in my own country and¦103901 then in Yerusalem¦103902.
\v 5 They also know, and could even testify¦103912 to you if they¦103911 would admit it, that I followed our¦103919 religious¦103920 laws very closely as a member¦103922 of the Pharisees party¦103922.
\v 6 Yet now I stand judged¦103939 for believing in the same hope as our ancestors¦103931—that hope promised¦103933 by our \nd God¦103937\nd*
\v 7 who we twelve¦103943 tribes¦103943 diligently serve day¦103949 and¦103948 night¦103947 in order to obtain—the hope, oh king¦103964, for which I'm being¦103958 indicted¦103958.
\v 8 So why do you¦103969 all find it¦103967 unbelievable¦103966 that \nd God¦103972\nd* can raise the dead¦103973?
\p
\v 9 “I too \add originally\add* thought it¦103987 necessary¦103987 to do many things to oppose the cause of this \nd Yeshua¦103984\nd* from Nazareth¦103986.
\v 10 So in Yerusalem¦103997 I worked to have many of these innocent believers locked¦104006 up in prison¦104005 with the authority¦104011 of the chief¦104010 priests¦104010, or if they were to be killed¦104013, I would add my vote against¦104016 them.
\v 11 And in all the Jewish¦104023 meeting¦104023 halls¦104023, \add when I found believers\add* I punished¦104025 them and forced them to curse \add God\add* and treated them with extreme anger, even travelling to further away towns.

\v 12 So it was one time travelling to Damascus¦104046 carrying permission¦104050 letters from the chief¦104054 priests¦104054
\v 13 that in the middle¦104056 of the day¦104055, oh king¦104061, I saw¦104060 a bright light¦104071 from the sky—even brighter than the sun¦104068—and it shone¦104069 on me and my companions.
\v 14 All of us fell down to the ground¦104084 and I heard¦104085 a voice¦104086 speaking to me in Hebrew saying¦104087, “Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting¦104100 me? Life will be difficult for you if resist me.”
\v 15 “Who are you, master?” I asked.

\v 20 so I preached first¦104214 to those in Damascus¦104213 and then in Yerusalem¦104218 and all of Yudea¦104226, and then in the towns of the non-Jews¦104229. I preached about turning from their sins and turning back to \nd God¦104238\nd*, and then actually living like people who had repented¦104233.
\v 21 It was because of these¦104245 things that the Jews¦104248 grabbed me in the temple¦104255 and tried to do me in.
\v 22 So¦104259 it is that with God's help¦104258 until¦104266 this very day¦104268 I have stood¦104270 testifying¦104271 to commoners and leaders, teaching nothing¦104277 other than what Moses and the prophets¦104283 had already written that would happen—
\v 23 that the \nd messiah¦104292\nd* would \add come and\add* suffer¦104290 and as the first¦104294 of the dead¦104297 to come back to life, he is going¦104299 to be proclaiming¦104301 light¦104298 to both Jews and non-Jews¦104307.”
\rem /s1 Paul Appeals to Agrippa to Believe
\p
\v 24 Then speaking about Paul's defence¦104311, Governor Festus said, “Paul, you're stark, raving¦104319 mad! All your education has turned you into an idiot.”
\p
\v 25 But Paul¦104331 said, “I haven't gone mad, most excellent¦104335 Festus, but¦104337 I'm speaking¦104342 the truth¦104338 in all seriousness.
\v 26 The king knows what I'm talking¦104353 about and that's why I'm speaking boldly¦104352, because none of these things were done in a corner¦104366 and I'm sure that none of it has escaped¦104354 his notice¦104354.
\v 27 King Agrippa¦104372, do you believe what the prophets¦104374 \add wrote\add*? Yes, I'm sure you do.
\p
\v 28 But Agrippa¦104380 answered Paul¦104383, “Do you think you can talk me into becoming a follower¦104390 of the messiah¦104390 in just that short time¦104386?”
\p
\v 29 “I hope to \nd God¦104401\nd*”, said Paul¦104395, “whether it takes a short time or a long time, that both you and the others listening today¦104418 will become¦104419 just like me except¦104426 for these¦104429 chains.”
\p
\v 30 Then the king¦104437 and the governor¦104440 both stood, along with Bernice¦104443 and the others sitting¦104446 with them
\v 31 and as they left they were saying¦104453 to each other, “That man¦104465 hasn't done anything deserving of death¦104457 or imprisonment.”
\p
\v 32 “Yes, he could have been set free,” replied Agrippa¦104467, “if he hadn't appealed¦104479 to Caesar.”

\s1 Paul is escorted off overseas
\rem /s1 Paul Sails for Rome
\rem /s1 Paul's journey to Rome
\p
\v 1 So when it¦104483 was considered the right season to sail to Italy, Paul¦104494 and¦104495 some other¦104497 prisoners¦104498 were put under the guard of a centurion¦104499 named Julius (from the Augustan¦104504 Regiment).
\v 2 We all boarded¦104505 on a ship¦104507 from Adramyttium¦104508 that was about to sail to various places¦104518 along¦104515 the coast of Asia \add Minor\add*. Aristarchus¦104523, a Macedonian man from Thessalonica¦104526, was with us as we¦104519 departed.
\p
\v 3 The next day¦104529 we¦104530 docked at Tsidon where Julius very kindly allowed Paul¦104539 to visit some of his friends¦104544 so they could provide for his needs.
\v 4 When we¦104551 left again, the ship stayed between Cyprus and the mainland because¦104554 of the unfavourable winds¦104557,
\v 5 then after sailing past Cilicia and¦104567 Pamphylia, we¦104570 docked at Myra in \add the province\add* of Lycia.
\v 6 There the centurion¦104582 found¦104580 a ship¦104584 from Alexandria¦104585 that was sailing¦104586 to Italy, so he boarded us on that.
\p
\v 7 After many days¦104598 of slow and difficult¦104601 sailing¦104599, we came alongside Cnidus but the wind¦104610 wasn't helpful to us, so we sailed¦104611 across to Crete and along the cape of Salmone.
\v 8 We sailed along¦104618 it¦104619 with difficulty¦104616 until we¦104620 came¦104620 to a place¦104622 called¦104624 ‘Fair Havens’ which¦104627 was near the city¦104630 of Lasea.
\p
\v 9 A lot of time¦104636 had now elapsed¦104637 and¦104638 the voyage¦104643 was starting to become dangerous¦104641 because¦104644 we were already heading into winter. Paul¦104653 advised¦104651 those in charge,
\v 10 telling them, “Men, I perceive¦104657 that we're going to encounter a lot of damage¦104660 on this voyage¦104681, with loss not only of the cargo¦104669 and the ship¦104672, but also our¦104677 lives¦104676.”
\v 11 But the centurion¦104684 was persuaded¦104693 by the ship¦104690 owner¦104690 and¦104688 the captain¦104687, rather¦104692 than by what Paul¦104698 had said.
\v 12 They realised that this harbour wasn't suitable to winter in, so the majority suggested leaving there¦104713 with the expectation of being¦104704 able to get to Crete to the winter in the harbour at Phoenix (which was open to both the southwest¦104728 and¦104729 the northwest¦104731).
\s1 The severe storm at sea
\rem /s1 The Storm
\rem /s1 The Storm at Sea
\p
\v 13 When a south¦104735 wind¦104735 started blowing gently¦104732, they thought they could make it, so they pulled in the anchor and sailed along¦104742 close to Crete.
\v 14 However¦104757, a short while later the wind¦104753 turned to a violent north-easter which¦104755 forced us out to sea.
\v 15 The ship¦104762 was driven by the wind¦104768 and unable to tack to face into it, so the sailors gave¦104769 up and just let it be driven.
\v 16 As we passed a small island¦104771 called¦104775 Clauda, we got a brief break and were able to resecure the lifeboat¦104785
\v 17 and then bring it up on board. Then ropes were used to wrap around the ship in case it were to run aground¦104800 into the shallows¦104798 at Syrtis and the gear was lowered¦104801,\f + \fr 27:17 \ft It's not certain what was meant here—it might have meant lowering the sails further to catch less wind or even lowering the mast, or else letting out the sea anchor to help keep the back of the ship facing the wind.\f* allowing the wind to drive¦104805 the ship along¦104805.
\v 18 We were violently¦104806 tossed¦104809 around by the storm¦104809, and the next day¦104811 the crew started \add lightening the ship by\add* tipping \add some of the cargo\add* overboard.
\v 19 By the third¦104817 day¦104817, the sailors themselves \add in desperation\add* were even throwing some of the ship's gear overboard.
\v 20 We didn't see either the sun¦104827 or the stars¦104829 for several more days¦104834—it wasn't a minor storm¦104835 by any means—and¦104836 by then any remaining hope that we had \add of staying alive\add* disappeared
\v 21 and no one had eaten or drunk much at all.
\p Then Paul¦104856 stood¦104854 up in the middle of them and said¦104860, “Well, you should have listened to me after all and not left Crete, so now we have this damage¦104875 and loss.
\v 22 Nevertheless I think we can all cheer¦104885 up because¦104887 not a single life¦104888 will be lost—only the ship¦104896—
\v 23 because last night¦104903 one of the messengers¦104914 of the \nd God¦104907\nd* that I serve came and stood¦104897 beside me
\v 24 and told me not to be afraid because I would indeed get to stand¦104922 before Caesar and that \nd God¦104928\nd* has granted¦104925 your lives to me as well.
\v 25 So¦104934 cheer¦104935 up, fellows, because¦104938 I am certain that \nd God¦104940\nd* will carry out what was told to me
\v 26 even though we'll run¦104957 aground¦104957 onto an island¦104951 first.”
\rem /s1 The Shipwreck
\p
\v 27 So it happened that in the middle¦104970 of our fourteenth¦104960 night of being¦104964 blown across the Adriatic¦104968 Sea, the sailors¦104975 suspected¦104973 that we were nearing land.
\v 28 They dropped a weighted line and measured the ocean depth at around 40 metres and then a bit later it was down to 30 metres.
\v 29 Worrying that the ship might run¦105011 aground¦105011 on rough¦105008 \add rocks\add*, they threw out four¦105017 anchors¦105016 from the stern¦105014 as they hoped that daylight would come quickly.
\v 30 Then the sailors¦105024 lowered¦105032 the lifeboat¦105034 as if planning to pull out some anchors¦105044 from the bow, but really planning to desert the ship¦105030.
\v 31 However Paul¦105049 told the centurion¦105051 and¦105052 the soldiers¦105054 that if the sailors didn't remain¦105058 with the ship¦105061, everybody couldn't be sure to be saved¦105064,
\v 32 so the soldiers¦105070 cut the ropes¦105073 attaching the lifeboat¦105075 and¦105076 allowed¦105077 it to run¦105079 aground¦105079.
\p
\v 33 As they waited for the daylight, Paul¦105092 encouraged them all to eat something, saying¦105096, “Today¦105098 is our fourteenth¦105097 day and you've had nothing¦105103 to eat. As we're waiting¦105100,
\v 34 I urge you to eat something. This will help you to have strength because¦105117 none of you are going to drown.”
\v 35 Having said¦105134 that, he gave¦105140 thanks¦105140 to \nd God¦105143\nd* in front of everyone, and breaking some bread¦105139, started eating¦105149 it.
\v 36 They all cheered¦105150 up and also started eating.
\v 37 There were two¦105174 hundred¦105174 and seventy-six¦105175 of them on the ship¦105172,
\v 38 and when they'd all eaten what they wanted, they lightened¦105182 the ship¦105184 more by throwing¦105185 their wheat¦105187 into the sea¦105190.
\s1 The ship runs aground
\rem /s1 The Shipwreck
\p
\v 39 Once it became¦105194 light, they saw that they were close to shore¦105205 in a bay but didn't recognise¦105199 the place. After some discussion, they decided to try to save the ship¦105218
\v 40 so they cut away the anchors¦105221 that were holding them in the sea¦105227 and untied the rudder¦105233 \add handles\add*. Then raising the foresail¦105237, they let the wind¦105238 blow them into the shore¦105243.
\v 41 But they hit a bank with ocean on both sides of it and the ship ran aground¦105249. The bow of the ship was completely stuck¦105258 but the stern¦105264 was being¦105265 broken up by the force¦105269 of the ocean.
\p
\v 42 At this point the soldiers¦105274 decided that they¦105280 should kill¦105280 the prisoners¦105279 in case any of them decided to swim away and escape¦105284,
\v 43 but the centurion¦105288 wanted to keep Paul¦105293 safe so he vetoed that plan. He commanded¦105300 those who could swim to jump off and swim in to shore,
\v 44 and for the others¦105323 to grab \add floating\add* planks¦105321 or something off the ship¦105329 \add that would float\add*, and so everyone¦105319 got safely¦105334 onto the beach.

\rem /s1 Paul on the Island of Malta
\p
\v 1 Once everyone was safe, we¦105342 discovered that the island¦105347 is called¦105348 Malta.
\v 2 And the people there showed incredible kindness¦105358 to us as they¦105365 welcomed us and lit a fire¦105363, as it started raining again and was very cold¦105376.
\v 3 However when Paul¦105380 was helping to pick up sticks¦105381 and putting them on the fire¦105391, a viper¦105392 was driven out by the heat and clamped¦105399 its jaws down on his¦105403 hand¦105402.
\v 4 When the islanders saw¦105406 the snake hanging from his hand¦105415 they decided that he must be a murderer¦105422 who had survived the shipwreck but now fate had finally decided his time was up.
\v 5 However, Paul just shook the snake off into the fire¦105446 and wasn't harmed.
\v 6 The locals were waiting¦105466 for his arm to swell¦105457 up or for him to fall down dead¦105461, but after a while when nothing¦105469 happened they changed¦105474 their¦105474 minds¦105474 and decided that instead, he must be a god¦105482.
\p
\v 7 The area that we had beached in belonged to the leader¦105493 of the island¦105495 named Publius. He welcomed us and looked after us for three¦105501 days¦105502,
\v 8 but while we were there, his father¦105509 got sick with dysentery¦105514 and fever¦105512. Paul¦105521 went in and placing his hands¦105528 on him, prayed¦105524 for him and healed¦105530 him.
\v 9 As a result of that, anyone on the whole island¦105544 who was sick came and was cured
\v 10 and so the people brought us many gifts and when we left, they supplied us with provisions.

\v 11 After three¦105569 months¦105570 we¦105572 were able to leave on an Alexandrian¦105579 ship¦105574 that had wintered¦105575 at the island¦105578. It was decorated with carvings of the twin ‘gods’.
\v 12 We stayed three¦105589 days¦105587 when we¦105586 arrived at Syracuse
\v 13 and then we sailed on to Rhegium. The next day a south¦105602 wind came so we sailed on to Puteoli

\v 15 The believers¦105628 in Rome had heard¦105629 about us, so they came¦105633 to meet us at the Appius Market¦105643 and the Three¦105645 Taverns¦105646. Paul¦105650 was encouraged to see them and thanked¦105651 \nd God¦105653\nd*.

\p
\v 17 After three¦105689 days¦105688, he called together the leaders¦105698 of the Jews¦105697 \add in Rome\add*, and when they'd all gathered he spoke to them, “Men, brothers¦105708, I have done nothing¦105710 against my people¦105714 or against our ancestral¦105719 customs¦105717. I was taken prisoner¦105720 in Yerusalem¦105722 and handed over to the Romans
\v 18 who, after examining¦105730 me, wanted to release me because¦105736 I had done nothing worthy of execution.
\v 19 But in defending myself against the Jews there, I felt compelled¦105748 to appeal¦105749 to Caesar, although I myself had no complaint against the Jews.
\v 20 So¦105763 that was why I called for you and wanted to address¦105771 you, because¦105774 I am in chains¦105781 for the sake of Israel's hope—\add the messiah\add*.”
\p
\v 21 “We haven't received¦105797 any correspondence here about you,” they answered. “Nor have any of our brothers¦105805 \add from Yerusalem\add* arrived¦105802 here to report¦105806 any crimes of yours.
\v 22 But we would very much like to hear¦105818 from you about your thinking¦105820, because we've certainly heard about this new sect because everyone¦105832 is speaking out against¦105833 it.”
\rem /s1 Paul Preaches in Rome
\p
\v 23 Then they set a day¦105837 when they could visit him where he was staying and so that from morning¦105873 to evening¦105875 he could explain¦105848 about God's kingdom¦105854 and show them how Moses' law and the prophets' writings spoke about \nd Yeshua¦105863\nd*.
\v 24 Afterwards some were persuaded¦105880 while others¦105884 didn't find it believable.
\v 25 They argued back and forth, and as they¦105892 were about to leave, Paul¦105895 shared this final¦105897 message¦105896, “The holy \nd spirit¦105901\nd* spoke¦105904 rightly through Isayah¦105907 the prophet¦105909 to your¦105913 ancestors¦105912, saying:
\q1
\v 26 Go to these people¦105924 and tell them,
\q1 When you listen you will hear¦105929 but not understand¦105935,
\q1 and when you look you will see but not perceive¦105943 it.
\q1
\v 27 Because these people's¦105950 minds have become¦105945 dull
\q2 and they can barely hear with their ears
\q2 and they shut their eyes,
\q1 just in case their eyes might actually see,
\q2 and their ears might actually hear,

\q2 and then I would heal them.
