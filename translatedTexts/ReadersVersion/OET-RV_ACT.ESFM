\mt2 commonly called
\mt1 Acts
\is1 Introduction
\is2 Author
\ip This account commonly known as \bk The Acts of the Ambassadors of Jesus the Messiah\bk*, is the continuation of \bk The Good Message according to Luke\bk*, and unlike most other Bibles, the \em Open English Translation\em* places these two accounts one after the other.
\is2 This account
\ip The main purpose of this account is to tell about the actions of the first followers of Jesus the messiah. The spirit of the master helped them to proclaim good message about him “in Jerusalem and all across \add the provinces of\add* Judea and Samaria, and all the way to the furtherest parts of the planet” (1:8).
\ip This document has three divisions related to the expanding circles as the good message from Jesus the messiah spread wider and wider: (1) In \bd Jerusalem\bd* where the believers start to get organised after Jesus ascended up into the clouds; (2) the work and the message spreads wider out to all of the district of \bd Judea\bd*; and (3) spreading more widely again around the Mediterranean Ocean and all the way to \bd Rome\bd*.
\ip It's also documented here about how God's spirit came to the believers as they were together in a room in Jerusalem at the Feast of Pentecost (fifty days after The Passover). The spirit helps and gives wisdom and strength to the believers and teachers of believers.

\s1 Introduction
\p
\v 1 \x + \xo 1:1: \xt Luk 1:1-4.\x*Dear Theophilus, I wrote my first account about all the things that Jesus began to do and to teach
\v 2 until the day when he was taken up\x + \xo 1:1: \xt Luk 24:51.\x* \add into the sky\add* after, with the help of the pure spirit, having commanded the ambassadors that he had chosen.
\s1 Jesus, alive, tells them to wait
\p
\v 3 After the time of his suffering, Jesus presented himself to them in ways that were infallible proofs \add that he was alive again\add*—appearing to them and telling them about God's kingdom.
\v 4 \x + \xo 1:4: \xt Luk 24:49.\x*Once when they were together, he told them, “Don't leave Jerusalem, but wait there for what was promised by the father, as you all have \add already\add* heard me say.
\v 5 \x + \xo 1:5: \xt Mat 3:11; Mrk 1:8; Luk 3:16; Jn 1:33.\x*John immersed \add people\add* in water, but you all will be immersed in the pure spirit in just a few days.”
\s1 Jesus' ascension
\p
\v 6 So when they were \add next\add* gathered together, they asked him, “Master, is this now the time when you'll be restoring the kingdom to Israel?”\f + \fr 1:6 \ft At the time of asking, the Israelis were burdened under the rule and taxes of the Roman occupiers.\f*
\p
\v 7 But Jesus responded to them, “You don't need to know the times or seasons \add when future events will happen\add*—it's the father who decides all that.
\v 8 \x + \xo 1:8: \xt Mat 28:19; Mrk 16:15; Luk 24:47-48.\x*However, you all will be receiving power when the pure spirit lands on you. Then you'll tell \add people\add* about me in Jerusalem and all across \add the provinces of\add* Judea and Samaria, and all the way to the furtherest parts of the planet.
\v 9 \x + \xo 1:9: \xt Mrk 16:19; Luk 24:50-51.\x*After he'd said that and while they were still looking at him, he was lifted up \add into the sky\add* until they could no longer see him because of the cloud\add s\add*.
\p
\v 10 As they stood there staring into the sky after he'd gone, suddenly two men in white clothes were standing beside them
\v 11 and said, “You men from Galilee! Why are you still standing there looking up at the sky? This Jesus who has been taken up away from you into heaven will come back in the same way that you saw him go up into heaven.”
\s1 Matthias replaces Judas Iscariot
\p
\v 12 Then they walked down the Mount of Olives and returned to Jerusalem which was less than a kilometre away.
\v 13 \x + \xo 1:13: \xt Mat 10:2-4; Mrk 3:16-19; Luk 6:14-16.\x*They went into the upstairs room where they were staying—Peter and John, Jacob and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, Jacob (son of Alpheus), Simon (the Zealot member), and Judas (son of Jacob).
\v 14 They were united in their ongoing prayers, along with Miriam the mother of Jesus, and his brothers.
\p
\v 15 Then one day, Peter stood up in the meeting of the believers (about 120 of them) and said,
\v 16 “Brothers, it was necessary for the scripture to be fulfilled, where the pure spirit had spoken previously through David about Judas, the one who guided those that arrested Jesus
\v 17 because Judas was one of us and took his part in our work.
\p
\v 18 \x + \xo 1:18-19: \xt Mat 27:3-8.\x*(Judas had bought a field with the money he had received for his treachery, and when he had fallen down \add in that field\add*, his stomach had burst open and his intestines had slid out \add on the ground\add*.
\v 19 So everyone in Jerusalem started calling that place ‘The field of blood’.)
\p
\v 20 \x + \xo 1:20: a \xt Psa 69:25; \xo b \xt Psa 109:8.\x*Now it was written in the scroll of songs:
\q1 ‘Let his place become deserted with no one living there,’
\m and
\q1 ‘Let another person take his position.’
\p
\v 21 So now it's appropriate for one of the men that has been with us for the whole time that the master Jesus was interacting with us,
\v 22 \x + \xo 1:22: a \xt Mat 3:16; Mrk 1:9; Luk 3:21; \xo b \xt Mrk 16:19; Luk 24:51.\x*from Jesus' immersion by John until the day that he was lifted up from us \add into the clouds\add*—a witness of the resurrection—to fill this position.
\p
\v 23 So they selected two men: Joseph Barsabbas (nicknamed Justus) and Matthias.
\v 24 Then they requested, “Master, you know everyone's inner thoughts, so reveal to us which of these two that you have chosen
\v 25 to take this position of service and being an ambassador—the position that Judas deserted to go to his own place.”
\v 26 So they drew straws and Matthias was marked so he was chosen to join the eleven ambassadors.
\c 2
\s1 God's spirit arrives and many get saved
\p
\v 1 \x + \xo 2:1: \xt Lev 23:15-21; Deu 16:9-11.\x*When the Day of Pentecost actually arrived, the believers met together in the same room.
\v 2 Suddenly there was a noise in the sky that sounded like a strong wind, then it filled the entire house where they were sitting.
\v 3 They saw what looked like tongues of fire that kept dividing\f + \fr 3:1 \ft See https://www.billmounce.com/monday-with-mounce/what-%E2%80%9Cdivided-tongue%E2%80%9D-acts-2-3-0\f* and then settling down on each one of them.
\v 4 In this way they were all filled with the pure spirit and began speaking in other languages as the spirit enabled them.
\p
\v 5 At the time, there were godly Jews staying in Jerusalem that had come from other countries all around the world.
\v 6 When they heard this noise, lots of people came to investigate but they were confused because they heard the believers talking in their own languages \add from around the world\add*.
\v 7 They were astounded and marvelled, asking, “Wow, aren't these people talking all Galileans?
\v 8 So how come we're hearing them speak the languages of the countries where we were born?
\v 9 There's people here from Parthia, Media, Elam, Mesopotamia, Judea, Cappadocia, Pontus, Asia,
\v 10 Phrygia, Pamphylia, Egypt, Libya (near Cyrene), and visitors from Rome,
\v 11 Crete, and Arabia. Some are Jews and some are non-Jews who've converted \add to Judaism\add*. And we can hear them talking about God in our languages.”
\v 12 Everyone was amazed and totally puzzled, asking each other, “What's going on here?”
\v 13 But others scoffed and said, “Ha, they've just had too much to drink.”
\s1 Peter's sermon
\p
\v 14 So the twelve stood up and Peter told the crowd in a loud voice, “People of Judea and everyone staying in Jerusalem. Listen to me so that I can explain this to you.
\v 15 This group is not drunk like you're all thinking, because it's still mid-morning,
\v 16 but you're seeing what the prophet Joel wrote about:
\q1
\v 17 \x + \xo 2:17-21: \xt Joel 2:28-32 (LXX).\x*God said, ‘In the last days I will pour out my spirit on all humanity—your children will tell of future events, your young men will see visions, and your old men will have dreams \add from God\add*.
\v 18 I will pour my spirit out on my male and female slaves and they will tell of future events.
\v 19 I will do unusual things with the stars and planets, and also down on the earth below: blood, fire, and clouds of smoke.
\v 20 I'll make the sun go dark and the moon go blood red. This will happen before the great victorious day of the coming of the master.
\v 21 Then everyone who relies on the name and authority of the master will be saved.’
\p
\v 22 “Fellow Israelis, listen to this account: You yourselves know that God did miracles through Jesus from Nazareth, and he fulfilled signs \add from the scriptures\add*—in fact God did this right in front of you.
\v 23 \x + \xo 2:23: \xt Mat 27:35; Mrk 15:24; Luk 23:33; Jn 19:18.\x*Then as part of God's plan and foreknowledge, this Jesus was taken to the authorities by those who didn't follow their own laws, and you all killed him by having him executed on a pole.
\v 24 \x + \xo 2:24: \xt Mat 28:5-6; Mrk 16:6; Luk 24:5.\x*But God released him from the agonies of death and brought him back to life—death couldn't restrain him.
\v 25 \x + \xo 2:25-28: \xt Psa 16:8-11 (LXX).\x*As David wrote,
\q1 ‘I foresaw the master always being in front of me. I refuse to be afraid because he's there on my right.
\q1
\v 26 Because of that, I was happy and spoke out my praises. My whole body lives in anticipation
\v 27 because you will never abandon my soul in Hades, nor will you allow the godly one to decay.
\v 28 You showed me the roads to life. You fill me with gladness because of your presence.’
\p
\v 29 “Fellow Israelis, we can tell you all with confidence that our patriarch David both died and was buried, and his tomb is still here with us today.
\v 30 \x + \xo 2:30: \xt Psa 132:11; 2Sam 7:12-13.\x*So because he was a prophet, and knowing that God has promised him to seat one of his descendants on his throne,
\v 31 he was foretelling the resurrection of the messiah who was neither ‘abandoned in Hades nor did his body decay.’
\v 32 Then God raised this Jesus back to life and we're all witnesses of that.
\v 33 Now he's sitting at God's right hand, and having received the promise of the pure spirit from the father, he poured this out which you are all seeing and hearing \add today\add*.
\v 34 \x + \xo 2:34-35: \xt Psa 110:1.\x*You see, David never went up to the heavens, but he himself said,
\q1 ‘The master said to my master: Sit down at my right
\q1
\v 35 until I defeat your enemies.’
\p
\v 36 “So let all Israel know that this Jesus that you executed on a pole, God made him both the master and the messiah.”
\p
\v 37 When the people heard that, they were deeply troubled and asked Peter and the other ambassadors, “What should we do then, brothers?”
\p
\v 38 Peter responded, “Turn away \add from your sins\add* and each one of you needs to be immersed by the authority of Jesus the messiah. Then your sins will be forgiven and you all will receive the gift of the pure spirit,
\v 39 because that promise is to you all and your children and to their descendants—to anyone who will call out to the master, our God.”
\p
\v 40 Then Peter shared further teaching with them and encouraged them to save themselves out from this corrupt generation.
\v 41 Because of that, those who welcomed his teaching were immersed and about three thousand people were added to their numbers that day.
\v 42 They continued listening to the teaching of the ambassadors, and in building their relationships with each other, and in breaking bread and praying together.
\s1 The lifestyle of the early believers
\p
\v 43 They were serious in their learning about God, and the ambassadors did many miracles and signs of God's power in Jerusalem and all the people wanted to be right with God.
\v 44 \x + \xo 2:44: \xt Acts 4:32-35.\x*All those who did believe were united in purpose and had shared use of many things.
\v 45 Some sold their properties and possessions and divided them among the group so that everyone had everything they needed.
\v 46 Each day they \add worshipped\add* together at the temple and also went to various homes to break bread together. They talked about Jesus at their mealtimes without sophisication,
\v 47 praising God and being popular with the people, and every day the master was adding more that were being saved.

\s1 A lame man starts bouncing around
\p
\v 1 One afternoon at 3pm, Peter and John were going to the prayer meeting in the temple.
\v 2 Now there was a man who had been lame from birth and everyday, was placed beside a door of the temple. (It was entry named ‘Beautiful Door’.) From there he could beg from the people entering the temple.
\v 3 He saw Peter and John about to enter into the temple, so he asked them for a donation,
\v 4 but Peter and John, looking closely at him, said, “Look at us!”
\v 5 So the man grabbed onto them, expecting to receive something from them.
\v 6 But Peter said, “I don't have any silver or gold, but I'll give you what I do have. With the authority of Jesus the messiah from Nazareth, \add I command you\add* to walk.”
\v 7 Then Peter grabbed him by the right hand and pulled him upwards. Immediately the man's feet and ankles were strengthened
\v 8 and he jumped up and stood and started walking and went into the temple with them, walking and skipping and praising God.
\v 9 All the people \add there\add* saw him walking and praising \add \add* God
\v 10 and recognising that he was the man who usually sat \add outside\add* begging at the ‘Beautiful Door’ of the temple, they were astonished and astounded at what had happened to him.
\s1 Peter's sermon in the temple
\p
\v 11 As the man clung onto Peter and John, all the people ran to see them in Solomon's Porch and very very amazed.
\v 12 But when Peter saw \add the crowd\add*, he answered their thoughts, “Fellow Israelis, why are you all puzzled about this, and why are you staring at us as if this man's walking because of \em our\em* power or closeness to God.”
\v 13 \x + \xo 3:13: \xt Exo 3:15.\x*The god of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob—the god of our fathers—gave honour to his servant, Jesus, who you handed over \add to be killed\add* and rejected him when Pilate had judged him and wanted to release him.
\v 14 \x + \xo 3:14: \xt Mat 27:15-23; Mrk 15:6-14; Luk 23:13-23; Jn 19:12-15.\x*You disowned this man who was innocent and sinless, and instead you requested that a murderer be released to you,
\v 15 however in doing so, you killed the creator of life, who God then raised from the dead as we can attest.
\v 16 Now it's \add our\add* faith in the authority of Jesus that has strengthened \add the legs\add* of this man that you have seen and that you already knew—this authority and faith that comes from Jesus completely healed this main right in front of you all.
\p
\v 17 So now, friends, I know that you did that in ignorance, just like your leaders.
\v 18 But God was fulfilling what he had had written by the prophets, that the messiah should suffer.
\v 19 Because of that, \add you all need to\add* repent and turn back \add to God\add* so that your sins can be erased
\v 20 and then times of refreshing will come from the presence of the master, and so that he may send back Jesus the messiah who has been appointed \add to save\add* you.
\v 21 \add For now\add* it is appropriate for heaven to receive him, until the times of restoration of everything, which \add again\add* God has had written by the faithful prophets.
\v 22 \x + \xo 3:22: \xt Deu 18:15,18 (LXX).\x*Indeed Moses said, ‘The master, our God will raise up a prophet for you that's like one of your own brothers. You must listen to everything he says—whatever he tells you.
\v 23 \x + \xo 3:23: \xt Deu 18:19.\x*Everyone who doesn't listen to that prophet will end up totally destroyed and not part of \add God's\add* people.’
\v 24 Similarly, the prophets from Samuel onwards spoke in turn, and when they spoke they foretold these \add current\add* days.
\v 25 \x + \xo 3:25: \xt Gen 22:18.\x*And you are the descendants of those prophets, and part of the agreement between God and your ancestors, when he told Abraham, ‘All the families in the world will be blessed by one of your descendants.’
\v 26 God had raised up his servant and sent him to you \add Jews\add* first, to bless you by turning each of you away from your own wicked \add behaviour\add*.”
\c 4
\s1 Peter and John are threatened by the religious leaders
\p
\v 1 While Peter and John were still talking to the people, the chief priests and a temple officer and some from the Sadducee sect approached them
\v 2 because they were very upset about what they had been teaching the people, including preaching that Jesus could give life to the dead.
\v 3 So they arrested the two, and as it was already evening, they put them in jail overnight.
\v 4 Despite this, many people who had heard their message trusted \add in Jesus\add* and the number of men who were believers grew to around 5,000.
\p
\v 5 Then the next day, the religious leaders and the elders and the religious teachers gathered together in Jerusalem
\v 6 along with those descended from high priests, including Annas the current high priest and Caiaphas and John and Alexander.
\v 7 After \add having Peter and John brought in and\add* standing them in the middle, they began to ask, “Under what authority or name did you do this?”
\p
\v 8 Then Peter, having been filled with the pure spirit, said to them, “Rulers of the people and elders,
\v 9 if we're being questioned today about a good deed done to a man who couldn't walk and which resulted in his healing,
\v 10 then you all need to know, and the people of Israel should also know that it was done under the authority and name of Jesus the messiah. He was the man from Nazareth that you executed on a pole, but who God brought back to life. It was by his authority and name that this man can now stand before you without deformity.
\v 11 \x + \xo 4:11: \xt Psa 118:22.\x*This Jesus is
\q1 ‘the stone which was rejected by you builders,
\q1 has now become the \add vital\add* cornerstone.’
\m
\v 12 We can't be saved by anyone else, because there's no other name or authority that's been given in the entire world under which people can be saved.
\p
\v 13 The assembled leaders were amazed saw the boldness of Peter and John who they knew to be illiterate, working-class men, and then recognised that they had been with Jesus.
\v 14 But since the man who was no longer deformed was standing there with them, there was nothing that they could really accuse them of.
\v 15 So they had them removed from the room, and asked each other,
\v 16 “What should we do with these fellows? By now everyone in Jerusalem's heard about the miracle they did, and we have no way to rebuff it.”
\v 17 However, we have to stop it spreading even further, so maybe we should ban them from speaking about this name \add or authority\add* to anyone.
\v 18 So they called them back in and decreed that they weren't allowed to preach or teach under the name \add or authority\add* of Jesus anymore.
\p
\v 19 But Peter and John answered, “You judge \add for yourselves\add* whether it's right in God's eyes to listen to you rather than to him?
\v 20 As for us, we're not able to be silent about what we saw and heard.”
\v 21 So after making some further threats, the leaders sent them off. They hadn't been able to find anything to punish them for because the people were all praising God for what had happened
\v 22 because the man who had miraculously recovered was over forty years old.
\s1 The believers ask God for power
\p
\v 23 After Peter and John had been released, they went to their own \add group\add* and told them what the chief priests and elders had said.
\v 24 \x + \xo 4:24: \xt Exo 20:11; Neh 9:6; Psa 146:6.\x*When they heard this, they all began to pray out loud to God, saying, “Master, you created heaven and the earth and the sea and everything in them.
\v 25 \x + \xo 4:25-26: \xt Psa 2:1-2 (LXX).\x*You spoke \add long ago\add* by the pure spirit through our ancestor who was your servant, David, when you said,
\q1 ‘Why are the other nations angry and their peoples tried new \add ideas\add*?”
\q1
\v 26 The earthly kings and rulers stood a worked together against the master and against his messiah.’
\m
\v 27 \x + \xo 4:27: a \xt Luk 23:7-11; \xo b \xt Mat 27:1-2; Mrk 15:1; Luk 23:1; Jn 18:28-29.\x*And indeed Herod and Pontius Pilate met with the pagan \add Romans\add* and the peoples of Israel to conspire against your pure servant Jesus who you chose.
\v 28 Then they did exactly what your power and plan had already decided would happen.
\v 29 So now, master, see their threats and help us, your slaves, to be able to proclaim your message with boldness.
\v 30 Let us experience your power to heal and do miracles and things that confirm the scriptures by means of the name \add and authority\add* of your pure servant, Jesus.”
\p
\v 31 As they finished their requests, the place where they had met was shaken and all of them were filled with the pure spirit, and they \add went out and\add* proclaimed God's message with boldness.
\s1 The believers share their wealth and possessions
\p
\v 32 \x + \xo 4:32: \xt Acts 2:44-45.\x*And so the group of believers were united in their will and attitude. No one claimed anything to be their own, but they shared everything they had.
\v 33 The ambassadors of the master, Jesus, experienced great power and proclaimed the truth about how he came back to life, and \add God's\add* favour was with them.
\v 34 None of them were lacking anything, because any of them who owned properties or houses would sell them and bring the proceeds.
\v 35 They would lay them down in front of the ambassadors, and from there it was distributed around according to what needs each person had.
\p
\v 36 Joseph (a Levite born in Cyprus who was nicknamed ‘Barnabas’, meaning ‘Encourager’, by the ambassadors)
\v 37 owned a field which he sold, and brought the money and put it down in front of the ambassadors.
\c 5
\s1 The death of Ananias and Sapphira
\p
\v 1 But in contrast, a couple named Ananias and Sapphira sold a property
\v 2 but agreed together to hide some of the proceeds. So Ananias brought a smaller amount and put it down in front of the ambassadors.
\v 3 Then Peter said, “Ananias, why has Satan filled your mind such that you would lie to the pure spirit and keep aside some of the proceeds of the property?
\v 4 Wasn't it yours before it was sold? And even when it was sold, the money was still yours. Why did you decide to handle it like this? It wasn't people that you're lying to, but God.”
\v 5 When Ananias heard that, he fell down and stopped breathing. Everyone who heard about it felt very afraid,
\v 6 and the young men there stood up and covered his \add body\add*, carried it out, and buried him.
\p
\v 7 After about three hours, Ananias' wife came in, not knowing anything about what had happened.
\v 8 Peter checked, “Is it true that you guys sold the property for such-and-such an amount?”
\p “Yes, for that amount,” she replied.
\p
\v 9 But Peter said to her, “Why did the two of you agree to test the spirit of the master? The guys wh just buried your husband are just out the door, and they'll carry you out also.”
\v 10 Sapphira immediately fell down in front of him and stopped breathing. Then the young men came in and found her dead, so they took \add her body out\add* and buried her with her husband.
\v 11 So the entire assembly of believers became very afraid, along with every else who heard about these events.
\s1 Ongoing miracles and healings
\p
\v 12 The ambassadors went on to do many miracles and amazing things, and all the people who gathered in Solomon's Porch had a single visions,
\v 13 but no one else dared to join them. However, the people were talking positively about them
\v 14 and more were becoming believers in the master—big numbers of both men and women.
\v 15 Some would even bring those who were sick out to the side of the road, lying them on beds and mats waiting for Peter to come past so that his shadow might touch them.
\v 16 More crowds were coming from the towns around Jerusalem, bringing those who were sick and those tormented by demons, and they were all getting healed.
\s1 The preachers get arrested but released again
\p
\v 17 But the chief priest and his colleagues who were members of the sect of Sadducees were filled with jealously and took action
\v 18 by having the ambassadors arrested and thrown into the public jail.
\v 19 But one of the master's angels opened the prison doors during the night and led them out again, saying,
\v 20 “Now go and stand in the temple and keep telling the people all the teaching about \add new\add* life.”
\v 21 So at dawn, having taken notice of the angel, they went into the temple and started teaching \add the people there again\add*.
\p When the chief priest arrived with his companions, they called together the \add religious\add* council and also the \add political\add* council of Israel, then called for the ambassadors to be brought in from the prison.
\v 22 But when their attendants got to the jail, they weren't there, so they returned to the gathering and told them,
\v 23 “We found the prison all locked up with the guards in their positions at the doors, but when they opened it up, there was no one inside!”
\v 24 When they heard this, the officer of the temple and the chief priests were totally puzzled as to what could have happened.
\v 25 But then someone came in and told them, “Hey, the men that you put in prison are in the temple—standing there teaching the people.”
\v 26 So the temple officer took the attendants and went and got them, but didn't use force because they were afraid that the people might start throwing rocks at them.
\p
\v 27 So they brought them in and stood them in front of the council, where the chief priest addressed them,
\v 28 \x + \xo 5:28: \xt Mat 27:25.\x*“We officially commanded you all not to be teaching in this name and authority. But see here, now you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching, and then you're blaming us for the death of that man.”
\v 29 But Peter and the other ambassadors answered, “It's better to obey God than people.
\v 30 The god of our ancestors brought Jesus back to life after you all handed him over to be hung up on a pole.
\v 31 But God honoured this way-maker and saviour by placing him on his right, to \add encourage\add* Israel to repent and \add then\add* to forive their sins.
\v 32 We are witnesses of these messages, along with the pure spirit who God gave to the ones who obey him.”
\p
\v 33 When the gathered councils heard this, they were enraged and wanted to kill them.
\v 34 But a certain member of the Pharisee party named Gamaliel stood up in the council chamber. He was a law teacher respected by all the community, and he ordered the \add guards\add* to take them outside for a while,
\v 35 then he said, “Fellow Israelis, think carefully about what you're planning to do with these men.
\v 36 A while back, a man called Theudas became prominent, saying that he was someone important. Eventually about four hundred others joined him, but he was killed and those who had followed him were dispersed and it all came to nothing.
\v 37 A bit later a Galilean man named Judas became prominent at the time of the census and he attracted people to him. But he also died, and all those who'd been persuaded by him ended up being scattered.
\v 38 So here's my advice to you all: pull back from \add killing\add* these men and allow them, because if this teaching and goings on is man-made, it'll be overthrown,
\v 39 but if it's from God, you all won't be able to bring them down in the case that you find yourselves opposing God.”
\p So they were persuaded by Gamaliel,
\v 40 and after calling in the ambassadors and having them beaten, they commanded them not to speak under the name and authority of Jesus and then sent them out.
\v 41 So the ambassadors left the councils, very excited that they were considered worthy to be disgraced because of Jesus.
\v 42 After that, they never stopped teaching and preaching the good message about Jesus the messiah in the temple and in various homes.

\s1 Seven administrators appointed
\p
\v 1 However around that time when the number of Jesus-followers were growing, some of the Greek converts starting grumbling about the Jewish believers because the Greek widows were being overlooked in the daily sharing \add of food and money\add*.
\v 2 So the twelve \add ambassadors\add* assembled the believers together and told them, “We're not pleased about having to take time off \add sharing\add* the message of God to be serving here at the \add distribution\add* tables.
\v 3 So brothers, look around you for seven men who're well known to be full of \add God's\add* spirit and wisdom, so we can appoint them to be in charge of this part of the work.
\v 4 Then we \add ourselves\add* can continue to pray and share the message.”
\p
\v 5 This idea pleased the group, so they went ahead and chose Stephen (a man full of faith and of the pure spirit), Philip, Procorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolas (a non-Jew from Antioch who had previously converted to Judaism).
\v 6 They stood these seven up in front of the ambassadors, who prayed and then placed their hands on them.
\p
\v 7 God's message continued spreading and the number of followers in Jerusalem was rapidly increasing, and a large number of the priests became believers.
\s1 Stephen gets arrested after teaching and doing miracles
\p
\v 8 Now Stephen \add (one of the seven)\add* was full of grace and power and was doing miracles and amazing demonstrations of God's power among the people.
\v 9 But a group from the Freedmen Synagogue as well as \add Jews\add* from Cyrene, Alexandria, Cilicia, and Asia rose up and started arguing against Stephen,
\v 10 but they weren't able to refute the wisdom that he spoke \add with the help of\add* the pure spirit.
\v 11 So they got some men \add to falsely accuse Stephen\add* saying, “We heard him denigrating Moses and God.”
\v 12 So they stirred up the people and the elders and the law teachers and so they approached \add Stephen\add* and arrested him and brought him to the council \add chambers\add*.
\v 13 There they produced the false witnesses saying, “This man won't stop spreading messages against this holy \add temple\add* and against the law
\v 14 because we heard him saying that that Jesus from Nazareth will be tearing down this building and will be changing the traditions that Moses gave to us.”
\v 15 So then the council members looked across at Stephen and saw that his face \add was shining\add* like that of an angel.
\c 7
\s1 Stephen's history discourse and accusations
\p
\v 1 Then the chief priest asked \add Stephen\add*, “Is all this true?”
\p
\v 2 \x + \xo 7:2-3: \xt Gen 12:1.\x*And he replied, “My brothers and fathers, please listen. Our honoured God was seen by our ancestor Abraham in Mesopotamia before he moved to Haran
\v 3 and he told him, ‘Leave your land here and your relatives, and go to the place that I will show you.’
\v 4 \x + \xo 7:4: a \xt Gen 11:31; \xo b \xt Gen 12:4.\x*So he left Chaldea and moved to Haran, and then after his father died, he moved again to this land where we now live.
\v 5 \x + \xo 7:5: \xt Gen 12:7; 13:15; 15:18; 17:8.\x*Abraham hadn't received any land here as an inheritance, in fact he'd never been near this land and nor did he have any children, yet God promised to give the \add entire\add* country to him and his descendants.
\v 6 \x + \xo 7:6-7: \xt Gen 15:13-14.\x*And yet God \add also\add* told him that his descendants would end up staying in another country where they would be enslaved and mistreated for four hundred years.
\v 7 \x + \xo 7:7: \xt Exo 3:12.\x*However God promised to punish the nation that enslaved them and told him that in the end, they would leave that place and serve him here in this country.
\v 8 \x + \xo 7:8: a \xt Gen 17:10-14; \xo b \xt Gen 21:2-4; \xo c \xt Gen 25:26; \xo d \xt Gen 29:31–35:18.\x*And he contracted with Abraham about being circumcised, and so when he had Isaac, he circumcised him on the eighth day, and then Isaac went on to have Jacob, and Jacob to have the \add twelve\add* tribal leaders.
\p
\v 9 \x + \xo 7:9: a \xt Gen 37:11; \xo b \xt Gen 37:28; \xo c \xt Gen 39:2,21.\x*Those brothers went on to become jealous of Joseph and sent him back into Egypt \add as a slave\add*, but God was with him
\v 10 \x + \xo 7:10: \xt Gen 41:39-41.\x*and rescued him out of all his troubles there. Then God gave him wisdom and caused him to gain the favour of Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, who then appointed him as the ruler of all Egypt and over Pharaoh's own household.
\v 11 \x + \xo 7:11: \xt Gen 42:1-2.\x*Then a famine hit all Egypt and Canaan causing great distress and our ancestors were unable to find enough food.
\v 12 But Jacob heard that grain was available in Egypt, so first, he sent off our tribal leaders.
\v 13 \x + \xo 7:13: a \xt Gen 45:1; \xo b \xt Gen 45:16.\x*On their second visit, Joseph revealed himself to them, and so Pharaoh became aware of Joseph's heritage.
\v 14 \x + \xo 7:14: a \xt Gen 45:9-10,17-18; \xo b \xt Gen 46:27 (LXX).\x*Then Joseph sent for his father Jacob, and all the extended family—some seventy-five of them.
\v 15 \x + \xo 7:15: a \xt Gen 46:1-7; \xo b \xt Gen 49:33.\x*So Jacob went to Egypt, where he and the \add twelve\add* tribal leaders eventually died,
\v 16 \x + \xo 7:16: \xt Gen 23:3-16; 33:19; 50:7-13; Josh 24:32.\x*although their bodies were moved to Shechem where they were put into the tomb that Abraham had bought from the sons of Hamor.
\p
\v 17 \x + \xo 7:17-18: \xt Exo 1:7-8.\x*But as the time limit promised to Abraham by God was getting closer, \add our\add* people multiplied in Egypt
\v 18 until another Pharaoh ended up ruling there who had never known Joseph.
\v 19 \x + \xo 7:19: a \xt Exo 1:10-11; \xo b \xt Exo 1:22.\x*He took advantage of us Jews and mistreated our ancestors, even forcing them apart from their own babies so they wouldn't live.
\v 20 \x + \xo 7:20: \xt Exo 2:2.\x*Moses was born during that time and God considered him beautiful. He spent three months in his \add own\add* father's house
\v 21 \x + \xo 7:21: \xt Exo 2:3-10.\x*before being placed outside, from where Pharaoh's daughter took him and brought him up herself as her own son.
\v 22 So Moses was instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was a powerful speaker and project leader.
\p
\v 23 \x + \xo 7:23-29: \xt Exo 2:11-15.\x*But when he hit forty, it entered his mind to vist his relatives, the Israelis.
\v 24 When he noticed one of them being mistreated, he retaliated and while defending the oppressed man, he struck \add and killed\add* the Egyptian.
\v 25 He thought his relatives would understand that God was bringing salvation to them via him, but they didn't see it that way.
\v 26 So on the following day when he saw two of them quarrelling, he tried to resolve the situation by saying, ‘Men, you're alll brothers. Why are you injuring each other?’
\v 27 But the bullying one pushed him away and said, ‘Who made you the judge over us?
\v 28 Do you want to kill me like you killed that Egyptian yesterday?’
\v 29 \x + \xo 7:29: \xt Exo 18:3-4.\x*When he heard that, Moses fled \add Egypt\add* and became an exile in Midian where he \add eventually\add* had two sons.
\p
\v 30 \x + \xo 7:30-34: \xt Exo 3:1-10.\x*After another forty years, he was in the wilderness of Mount Sinai when he saw an angel in the flame of a burning thorn bush.
\v 31 Moses was amazed at the vision when he saw it so he approached \add the bush\add* to look more closely when he heard the voice of the master saying,
\v 32 ‘I am the god of your ancestors—the god of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob.’ At that point, Moses started trembling and was scared to go any closer to look,
\v 33 but the master said, ‘Take off your sandals, because the ground you're standing on is dedicated to God.
\v 34 I have noticed the mistreatment of my people in Egypt and heard their groaning and so I came down to rescue them, so now I'm going to send you \add back\add* to Egypt.’
\p
\v 35 \x + \xo 7:35: \xt Exo 2:14.\x*This was the same Moses that they had previously rejected and asked who had made him ruler and judge over them. Now God had indeed sent him as ruler and liberator by means of the angel that he saw in the thorn bush.
\v 36 \x + \xo 7:36: a \xt Exo 7:3; \xo b \xt Exo 14:21; \xo c \xt Num 14:33.\x*So eventually Moses led them out of Egypt after doing miracles and signs of God's power there, and then at the Red Sea and during the forty years in the wilderness.
\v 37 \x + \xo 7:37: \xt Deu 18:15,18.\x*This same Moses told the Israelis that in the future God would raise up from among them another prophet like him.
\v 38 \x + \xo 7:38: \xt Exo 19:1–20:17; Deu 5:1-33.\x*Now he was the person that \add led\add* the assembly \add of people\add* in the wilderness, was spoken to by an angel on Mt. Sinai, and one of our ancestors that received living messages to pass on to us.
\p
\v 39 “Yet our ancestors didn't want to obey that man, so they rejected him and started thinking about Egypt again,
\v 40 \x + \xo 7:40: \xt Exo 32:1.\x*saying to Aaron, ‘Make some gods for us to lead us, because we've got no idea what happened to that Moses who led us out of Egypt.’
\v 41 \x + \xo 7:41: \xt Exo 32:2-6.\x*So together they made a calf as an idol to bring sacrifices to, and they were pleased with what they'd achieved.
\v 42 \x + \xo 7:42-43: \xt Amos 5:25-27 (LXX).\x*But God turned and allowed them to serve the heavenly armies, just as the prophets wrote,
\q1 ‘It wasn't me that you Israelis sacrificed to for those forty years in the wilderness.
\q1
\v 43 You turned to Molech's tent and Rephan's star as your gods by making images of them to bow down to. So for that, I'll exile you all beyond Babylon.’
\p
\v 44 \x + \xo 7:44: \xt Exo 25:9,40.\x*The tent of evidence was with our ancestors in the wilderness—made to the pattern that God had shown Moses.
\v 45 \x + \xo 7:45: \xt Josh 3:14-17.\x*Our ancestors then carried that tent into the land having inherited it along with Joshua from the possession of the pagans which God drove out ahead of them. It remained there until the time of David
\v 46 \x + \xo 7:46: \xt 2Sam 7:1-16; 1Ch 17:1-14.\x*who found favour with God and requested to find a tent for the house of Jacob.
\v 47 \x + \xo 7:47: \xt 1Ki 6:1-38; 2Ch 3:1-17.\x*But it was Solomon who built the house for him.
\p
\v 48 But the highest one doesn't live in structures made by people, but as the prophet wrote,
\q1
\v 49 \x + \xo 7:49-50: \xt Isa 66:1-2.\x*‘Heaven is my throne,
\q1 and the earth is my footstool.
\q1 How could you possibly build a suitable house for me?
\q1
\v 50 Wasn't it me that created everything?’
\p
\v 51 \x + \xo 7:51: \xt Isa 63:10.\x*You stiff-necked people with uncircumcised hearts and ears! You're always opposing the pure spirit just like your ancestors were.
\v 52 Which one of the prophets wasn't persecuted by your ancestors? Even the ones that foretold the coming of the righteous one were killed off by them in just the same way that you yourselves became his betrayers and murderers!
\v 53 You had received the law under the direction of angels, and yet you didn't obey it.”
\s1 Stephen's lynching and death
\p
\v 54 When they heard that, they were raging inside and grating their teeth at him.
\v 55 But being full of the pure spirit, Stephen started up into the sky and was able to see God's splendor, as well as seing Jesus standing there on God's right.
\v 56 He said, “I can look through the sky that's opened up and can see mankind's child standing at God's right side.”
\p
\v 57 At this point, they blocked their ears and rushed together to grab Stephen, yelling loudly.
\v 58 They drove him out of the city and then started throwing rocks at him. His accusers left their cloaks in charge of a young man named Saul.
\v 59 As Stephen was being hit by the rocks, he called out, “Master Jesus, receive my spirit.”
\v 60 Then falling to his knees, just before he died he called out loudly, “Master, don't hold this sin against them.”
\c 8
\p
\v 1 (And Saul was agreeing that Stephen should be executed.)
\s1 Persecution of believers intensifies
\p That same day, intense persecution began against the assembly in Jerusalem, and so the believers fled throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except for the twelve who stayed.
\v 2 (Some godly men buried Stephen with loud wailing.)
\p
\v 3 \x + \xo 8:3: \xt Acts 22:4-5; 26:9-11.\x*As for Saul, he started on destroying the assembly by entering people's homes and dragging both men and women out and then off to prison.
\s1 Philip preaches in Samaria
\p
\v 4 However, now the people who had fled began the proclaim the good message to others in other places.
\v 5 Around the same time, Philip went to a city in Samaria and told them about the messiah.
\v 6 Crowds gathered and listened carefully to Philip and watched him do miracles—
\v 7 many demon-possessed people shouted loudly as the demons left them, and many who were paralysed or lame were healed
\v 8 so there were a lot of happy people there.
\s1 Simon the magician seeks power
\p
\v 9 One man in the city had been practicing magic and amazing the people and he claimed that he was someone great. His name was Simon
\v 10 and the people there from the least to the most important said, “This power is from the great god.”
\v 11 They gave him a lot of attention because he'd been amazing them with magic for quite a long time.
\v 12 However when Philip started preaching the good message about God's kingdom and the name and authority of Jesus the messiah, they believed the message, and many men and women asked to be immersed \add in water\add*.
\v 13 Simon himself also believed and was immersed, and then started accompanying Philip around—marvelling as he observed the miracles and signs of God's power.
\p
\v 14 When the ambassadors in Jerusalem heard that many people from Samaria had accepted God's message, they sent Peter and John out to them
\v 15 so then they prayed for them to receive the pure spirit.
\v 16 (The pure spirit hadn't fallen on any of them at that point, but they had only been immersed into the name and authority of the master Jesus.)
\v 17 So Peter and John placed their hands on the new believers and they received the pure spirit.
\p
\v 18 When Simon the magician saw that they received the spirit after having the hands of the ambassadors placed on them, he offered money to Peter and John, saying,
\v 19 “Give me this authority so that whoever I place \em my\em* hands on will receive the pure spirit.”
\p
\v 20 But Peter responded, “May your money join you in your destruction because you thought you could buy God's gift with it.
\v 21 There's no role for you here and no part for you in our work because your heart isn't right with God.
\v 22 You need to turn away from this evil \add desire\add* and beg the master that maybe he'll forgive you for your wrong intentions
\v 23 because I perceive that you have a bitter attitude and and ungodly habits.
\p
\v 24 Simon answered, “Oh, please ask the master on my behalf that none of what you mentioned will happen to me.”
\s1 Philip immerses the Ethiopian official
\p
\v 25 After that, Peter and John continued to testify and proclaim the good message about the master in many villages around Samaria before they returned to Jerusalem.
\p
\v 26 Then an angel from the master spoke to Philip, “Start walking and head south on the road that goes downhill from Jerusalem to Gaza through the wilderness.”
\v 27 So he headed off, and \add on the road\add* he came across an important official of the Ethiopia queen\f + \fr 8:27 \ft Some translations list the queen's name as ‘Candace’, but that was the name of the series of queens, cf., Pharaoh or Caesar which came to be used as a title for more than one person.\f* and was in charge of her treasury. This man had been in Jerusalem to worship God
\v 28 and was returning home in his chariot. As he rode, he was reading \add the scroll of\add* the prophet Isaiah,
\v 29 and the spirit told Philip to approach him and stay by the chariot.
\v 30 So Philip ran up to the chariot and heard the man reading from the prophet Isaiah and asked, “Do you know what it is that you're reading about?”
\p
\v 31 “How could I know when I don't have someone to guide me,” he answered, and so he invited Philip to climb up and sit with him.
\v 32 Now the particular passage that he was reading was this:\x + \xo 8:32-33: \xt Isa 53:7-8 (LXX).\x*
\q1 ‘He was led away like a sheep being led to the slaughterhouse,
\q1 and stayed as silent as a lamb being shorn
\q2 so he never opened his mouth.
\q1
\v 33 He was humiliated by a lack of justice.
\q1 Who can name his descendants,
\q2 because his life is being taken from the earth?’
\p
\v 34 “Now tell me,” said the official, “who was Isaiah talking about? Was he talking about himself or someone else?”
\v 35 So Philip started with that passage and explained the good message about Jesus to him.
\v 36 As they were going along the road, they came to some water, and the official asked, “Look, here's some water. What would stop me from being immersed here?”
\p
\v 37 ≈
\v 38 So he commanded \add the driver\add* to stop the chariot and they both climbed down, and Philip immersed the official in the water.
\v 39 But as they came out of the water, the master's spirit snatched Philip away and so the official never saw him again, but he continued on his journey very happy.
\v 40 As for Philip, he found himself at \add the town of\add* Azotus, and as he passed through \add the coastal towns\add* on the way to Caesarea, he proclaimed the good message in each town.
\c 9
\s1 Jesus talks to Saul
\r (Acts 22:6-16; 26:12-18)
\p
\v 1 Meanwhile Saul was still spouting off murderous threats towards the followers of the master. He went to the chief priest
\v 2 and obtained \add official\add* letters to enable him to enter the Jewish meeting halls in Damascus so that if he found either male or female followers of Jesus, he could arrest them and bring them to Jerusalem in chains.
\p
\v 3 On his journey as he approached Damascus, suddenly light from the sky flashed around him.
\v 4 He dropped to his knees and heard a voice calling, “Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?”
\p
\v 5 “Who are you, master?” he asked.
\p And the voice replied, “I'm Jesus, the one that you're persecuting.
\v 6 But stand up and go into the city, and you'll be told there what you need to do.”
\p
\v 7 Meanwhile his travelling companions had stood there speechless, because they had heard the voice but couldn't see anyone.
\v 8 They helped Saul up from the ground, but even when he opened his eyes, he couldn't see anything. So they had to lead him into Damascus by hand.
\v 9 Saul stayed there for three days, unable to see and not eating or drinking anything.
\s1 Ananias restores Saul's sight
\p
\v 10 Now there was a believer there in Damascus named Ananias, and the master spoke to him in a vision, calling, “Ananias.”
\p “I'm here, master,” he answered.
\p
\v 11 So the master told him, “Get up and go to Judas' house in Straight Street where you'll find a man named Saul from Tarsus. He's praying right now
\v 12 and in his vision, he saw a man named Ananias who comes in and places his hands on him so that he can receive his sight back.”
\p
\v 13 But Ananias resisted, “Master, I've heard a lot about that man, including all the evil things he's done to your dedicated people in Jerusalem,
\v 14 and the reason he's here in Damascus with the authority of the chief priests is to arrest everyone who trusts in you.”
\p
\v 15 But the master said, “Go now, because I have chosen that man to be a bearer of my name and authority both in other countries, even to their kings, and to the descendants of Israel,
\v 16 because I'll be showing him what he's going to have to suffer for bearing my name.”
\p
\v 17 So Ananias left and went into Judas' house where he placed his hands on Saul and said, “Brother Saul, the master has sent me here—Jesus the one you saw on the road when you were coming here—sio that you will be able to see again and also be filled with the pure spirit.”
\v 18 Immediately something like scales fell off his eyes and he was able to see again, and he got up and got immersed in water,
\v 19 before getting something to eat to renew his strength.
\s1 Saul starts preaching in Damascus
\p Then Saul stayed several days with the believers in Damascus.
\v 20 He went straight into the Jewish meeting halls and started proclaiming that Jesus is God's son.
\p
\v 21 The hearers were all amazed, saying, “Isn't this the guy that persecuted the ones following that Jesus in Jerusalem, and even came to Damascus to arrest them here and take them back to the chief priests?”
\p
\v 22 But Saul was growing stronger\f + \fr 9:22 \ft It's not clear here whether it means that Saul was growing physically stronger, or that his preaching and debating skills were improving.\f* and he was confounding the Jews living in Damascus as he taught them that Jesus is the \add promised\add* messiah.
\p
\v 23 \x + \xo 9:23-25: \xt 2Cor 11:32-33.\x*After several days, the religious Jews plotted together to kill him,
\v 24 but Saul found out about their plan. Those Jews were also watching the city exits so they could kill him if he tried leaving,
\v 25 but his supporters took him to the city wall at night time and lowered him down in a basket.
\s1 Saul goes to Jerusalem but has to leave
\p
\v 26 When he got back to Jerusalem, Saul attempted to join in with the believers there but they were all scared of him, not believing that he was a true follower of Jesus.
\v 27 However Barnabas took Saul and brought him to the twelve, and Saul told them how he had seen the master on the road, and been spoken to by him, and how he had spoken boldy in Damascus in the name and authority of Jesus.
\v 28 So Saul stayed connected with the believers, going in and out of Jerusalem and speaking boldly in the name and authority of the master.
\v 29 He also talked and debated with the Greek-speaking Jews, but they wanted to kill him,
\v 30 so when the brothers found out, they took Saul down to Caesarea \add on the coast\add*, and from there sent him \add on a ship\add* to Tarsus.
\p
\v 31 After that the assembly of believers throughout Judea and Galilee and Samaria had peace and grew in their respect and service of the master, also well as increasing in numbers through the encouragement of the pure spirit.
\s1 Peter heals Aeneas
\p
\v 32 Peter travelled around the country and then went to visit the dedicated believers in Lydda.
\v 33 He saw a paralysed man named Aeneas who'd spent eight years lying on his pallet,
\v 34 and said to him, “Aeneas, Jesus the messiah is healing you. Stand up and pack up your bed.” And straight away Aeneas stood up
\v 35 and all the people living in Lydda and Sharon who saw him turned to the master.
\s1 Peter brings Tabitha back to life
\p
\v 36 Then in Joppa there was a believer named Tabitha (or Dorcas if translated) and she did a lot of good things as well as being generous to the poor.
\v 37 Around that time she got sick and died. After washing her body, they placed it in an upper room,
\v 38 and since Joppa was near Lydda and the believers had heard that Peter was there, they quickly sent two men to request, “Please come as soon as possible.”
\v 39 So Peter went with them, and when they arrived in Joppa they took him up to the room. All the widows stood there, sobbing and showing him various clothes that Tabitha had made for them.
\v 40 But Peter had them all removed from the room, and then kneeling down he prayed before turning back to the body and said, “Tabitha, get up.” Then she opened her eyes, and seeing Peter there she sat up.
\v 41 Peter helped her to stand up, then he called the believers and the widows, and presented the live Tabitha to them.
\v 42 News of this spread throughout Joppa and many people there believed in the master.
\v 43 So Peter stayed on there for quite a few days, living with a tanner of hides named Simon.
\c 10
\s1 Peter and Cornelius each hear from God
\p
\v 1 Just up in Caesarea there was a Roman army commander named Cornelius (leader of the ‘Italian Regiment’)
\v 2 who, along with all his household, worshipped God and obeyed his laws. He gave to the poor and regularly asked God for help.
\v 3 One afternoon around 3pm he had a vision where he clearly saw an angel of God come into the house and spoke, “Cornelius.”
\p
\v 4 Cornelius was scared and looked intently and asked, “What is it, master?”
\p “Your prayers and your helping the poor rose up to God's notice and attention,” he said.
\v 5 “Now, send some messengers to Joppa to go and find a man there named Simon Peter.
\v 6 He's staying with Simon the tanner whose house is by the sea.”
\v 7 So as soon as the angel left, Cornelius called two of his house servants and a godly soldier from his bodyguard,
\v 8 and after explaining the task to them, he sent them off to Joppa.
\p
\v 9 The next day as they were approaching the town, Peter went up onto the flat roof of the house around midday to pray.
\v 10 But he felt hungry and wanted something to eat, but while it was still being prepared he fell into a trance
\v 11 and saw the sky open up. Something like a sheet was being lowered down to the earth by the four corners
\v 12 and it held all kinds of animals and reptiles, as well as birds.
\v 13 Then he heard a voice saying, “Get up Peter, and slaughter these and eat them.”
\p
\v 14 “I can't, master,” Peter responded, “because I've never eaten anything that's forbidden.”
\p
\v 15 But the voice spoke a second time, “Don't you be treating anything as unclean that God has made clean.”
\v 16 This vision happened three times and then the sheet thing was lifted back up into the sky.
\p
\v 17 Now Peter was still there wondering what the vision was all about when the men sent by Cornelius had tracked down the tanner's house and arrived outside.
\v 18 They called out to ask if Simon Peter was staying there.
\p
\v 19 Even as Peter still continued to ponder about the vision, the spirit said, “Hey, there's three men here looking for you.
\v 20 So get up and go downstairs to them. Believe everything they say because I sent them here.”
\v 21 So he went down and asked the men, “I'm the one you're looking for, so tell me what you came here for.”
\p
\v 22 They answered, “We were sent by Cornelius who's an army commander who worships God and obeys his laws and has a good reputation with you Jewish people. A holy angel told him to send for you to come to his house so they can listen to what you have to say.”
\v 23 So Peter invited them in to stay the night.
\p The next day, Peter and some of the believers from Joppa started out with them
\v 24 and they arrived in Caesarea the following day. Cornelius was expecting them and had also invited some relatives and close friends to join them.
\v 25 Peter entered the house and when they met, Cornelius knelt down and worshipped him.
\v 26 But Peter pulled him up and said, “Stand up. I'm just a man like you.”
\v 27 After greeting each other, Peter went into the main room and found that quite a few people had gathered there.
\v 28 Then he told them, “You all know that us Jews are forbidden by our laws to associate with or to enter the house of a non-Jew. However, God showed me that it's not right to treat other people as being lesser or undesirable.
\v 29 That's why I came without any reservations when you sent for me. But I'm still waiting to know what you all want from me?”
\p
\v 30 So Cornelius answered, “I was praying in my house three days ago in the middle of the afternoon when I suddenly saw a man in shining clothes standing in front of me
\v 31 and he said, ‘Your prayer has been heard, Cornelius, and God has noticed your gifts to the poor.
\v 32 Now he wants you to send messengers to get Simon, the one called Peter, from Joppa where he's living by the sea in Simon the tanner's house.’
\v 33 I did that straight away and you kindly came here, so now we're all here in God's \add sight\add* to find out everything that the master has commanded you to say.”
\s1 Peter's talk in Caesarea
\p
\v 34 So Peter spoke up and said, “Honestly, I'm still just realising that God doesn't favour only certain people\x + \xo 10:34: \xt Deu 10:17.\x*,
\v 35 but he accepts people from any nation as long as they honour and obey him.
\v 36 He sent us a message through the descendants of Israel—a good message that teaches that we can have peace through Jesus the messiah—everyone's master.
\v 37 And you all know the news that started in Galilee and spread through all Judea after the time of John's teaching and ministry of immersion—
\v 38 how God filled Jesus from Nazareth with the pure spirit and with power, and who then went around doing good and heaing all those oppressed by the devil, because God was with him.
\v 39 We are witnesses of all the things he did in the Jewish provinces and in Jerusalem, and then how he was executed by them on a stake.
\v 40 Then God brought him back to life on the third day and sent him where he could be seen,
\v 41 not by all the people, but to the witnesses that God had previously appointed—to us who ate with him and drank with him after he'd been raised from the dead.
\v 42 He commanded us to tell the people, and to testify that he is the one who God has designated to be the judge of the living and the dead.
\v 43 \add The writings of\add* all the prophets point towards him, and everyone who believes \add that he's God\add* can have their sins forgiven by his authority.”
\s1 God's spirit enters non-Jews
\p
\v 44 While Peter was still speaking, the pure spirit came down onto everyone who was listening.
\v 45 The Jewish believers who had come with Peter were astonished that the gift of the pure spirit had been poured out even on non-Jews
\v 46 as they heard them speaking in other languages and magnifying God. Then Peter said,
\v 47 “Surely no one could argue against them getting immersed in water now that they've received the pure spirit just like we did?”
\v 48 So with the authority of Jesus the messiah, he commanded for them to be immersed \add in water\add*.
\c 11
\s1 Peter explains everything to those in Jerusalem
\p
\v 1 Soon the ambassadors and other believers in Judea heard that non-Jews had also accepted God's message,
\v 2 but when Peter went to Jerusalem, the strict Jewish believers were upset with him,
\v 3 saying that he had gone into the home of uncircumcised pagans and \add even\add* eaten with them.
\p
\v 4 But Peter started explaining from the beginning,
\v 5 “I was staying in Joppa, and as I was praying I saw a vision of an object like a linen sheet coming down, as if it was being let down out of the sky by its four corners. As it came down to me
\v 6 I looked at it and saw animals, even wild animals, and reptiles and birds.
\v 7 I also heard a voice telling me, ‘Peter, get up and slaughter these and eat them.’
\v 8 But I said, ‘Master, I can't because I've never eaten anything that's forbidden.’
\v 9 But the voice from the sky spoke again, ‘Don't you be treating anything as unclean that God has made clean.’
\v 10 This happened three times, and then it was pulled up again into the sky.
\v 11 Next minute there were three men at the house where I was staying \add saying\add* that they had been sent from Caesarea to fetch me,
\v 12 and the spirit told me to go with them without questioning anything they said. These six other believers went with me, and we arrived at the house of the man.
\v 13 He told us how he'd seen an angel standing there in his house and who'd told him, ‘Send messengers to Joppa to fetch Simon, the one called Peter,
\v 14 and he will explain to you how you and all your household can be saved.’
\v 15 Then when I started speaking to them, the pure spirit came down on then just like it had happened to us previously.
\v 16 That reminded me of the words of the master when he told us, ‘John submerged people using water, but you all will be submerged by the pure spirit.
\v 17 Therefore if God gave the same gift to them that he'd given to us when we'd believed in the master Jesus the messiah, what authority did I have to contradict God?’ ”
\p
\v 18 When the group heard all this, they had no objections and they praised God, saying, “It seems that God has also allowed the pagans to repent and live.”
\s1 Many in Antioch become believers
\p
\v 19 Over time, due to the persecution that began with Stephen's killing, the ones who had moved away went as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch, but they only shared Jesus' teaching with other Jews.
\v 20 However, some of the believers were from Cyprus and Cyrene, and when they got to Antioch they proclaimed the good news from the master Jesus to the Greeks.
\v 21 And the master caused their efforts to prosper, so a large number of Greeks believed and decided to follow the master.
\p
\v 22 News about this reached the assembly in Jerusalem, so they sent Barnabas to Antioch.
\v 23 When he arrived and saw how God's grace \add was spreading\add*, he was elated and encouraged them all to earnestly continue to follow the master.
\v 24 Barnabas was good man and full of the pure spirit and full of faith \add in God\add*, and a large number of people decided to follow Jesus.
\p
\v 25 So Barnabas went to Tarsus to look for Saul,
\v 26 and when he found him, he brought him back to Antioch. Then for a whole year they met with the assembly and \add regularly\add* taught a large crowd. It was there in Antioch that the believers were first called Christians.
\p
\v 27 In those days, some prophets from Jerusalem went to Antioch,
\v 28 and one of them named Agabus when he was prompted by the spirit, stood up and predicted that the world would experience a severe famine (and this happened \add later\add* during the reign of Claudius).
\v 29 The believers decided to send assistance to their fellow believers who lived in Judea—each one according to his means—
\v 30 and so they did, sending their contributions with Barnabus and Saul to take to the elders.
\c 12
\s1 Persecution of believers restarts
\p
\v 1 Around that time, King Herod \add Agrippa\add* used his power to mistreat some of the believers from the assembly,
\v 2 and he had Jacob, the brother of John, executed using a sword.
\v 3 Then when he saw that it pleased the Jewish religious leaders, he went on to seize Peter during the Feast of Flat Bread.
\v 4 After being arrested, Peter was put in prison where he was guarded by four squads of four soldiers each. After the Passover Feast, Herod planned to display Peter to the people.
\v 5 But while he was being held in prison, those in the assembly were earnestly asking God to help him.
\s1 An angel leads Peter out of prison
\p
\v 6 Herod planned to send for Peter later that evening, but meanwhile Peter had fallen asleep chained with two chains between two soldiers. There were also prison guards at the door
\v 7 but an angel of the master \add suddenly appeared\add* standing by Peter and light radiated through the prison cell. The angel poked Peter in the side to wake him up, saying, “Quickly, get up!” The chains fell off his wrists
\v 8 and the angel said, “Get dressed and put on your sandals,” so he did. Then the angel said, “Now put on your coat and follow me.”
\v 9 So Peter followed the angel out of the cell, not really knowing if it was real or he was still dreaming.
\v 10 They went past the first guard and then the second, and then came to the iron gate which led out of the prison into the city. The gate opened by itself and they went out onto the street, then at the end of the street the angel suddenly left him.
\p
\v 11 By now Peter was fully awake and said to himself, “Now I know that the master really did send his angel to rescue me from Herod and from the plans of the Jewish leaders.”
\p
\v 12 Now that he realised this, he went to Mary's house (the mother of John Mark) where many believers had met to pray.
\v 13 He knocked at the door in the fence and a servant girl named Rhoda came out to see who it was.
\v 14 But when she recognised Peter's voice, she was so excited that she forgot about opening the door, but ran back inside to tell everyone that Peter was standing out there.
\v 15 They told her that she must be raving mad, but she insisted it was true, but they said that it must be his angel.
\p
\v 16 Meanwhile Peter continued knocking, and when they eventually opened the outer door they saw that it was him and they were amazed.
\v 17 But Peter signalled them with his hand to be quiet, and then he explained how the master had led him out of the prison, and instructed them, “Tell this to Jacob and the brothers.” Then he left and went off to another place.
\p
\v 18 Once daylight came, there was pandemonium among the soldiers \add in the prison as they tried to figure out\add* what had happened to Peter.
\v 19 Then when King Herod sent for Peter and he wasn't there, the prison guarded were interrogated and then taken away to be executed.
\p After that, Herod left Judea and went up to Caesarea to stay.
\s1 The death of Herod
\p
\v 20 Now King Herod was disputing with the people of Tyre and Sidon, and so they got together and persuaded Blastos, a close personal servant of the king, to be their spokesman in asking for peace because they were dependent on food from the king's provinces.
\p
\v 21 On the agreed day, Herod dressed in his royal garments and seated on his throne, started to address them.
\v 22 The crowd shouted out, “This is the voice of a god, not of a man.”
\v 23 Because he didn't attribute the honour to God, an angel of the master immediately struck him down and he stopped breathing as a result of a worm infestation.
\p
\v 24 Meanwhile God's message continued to spread and multiply.
\p
\v 25 By then Barnabas and Saul had completed their ministry and returned to\f + \fr 12:25 \ft TD:Some manuscripts have ‘from’ here because in the next few sentences it seems that they were returned to Antioch.\f* Jerusalem taking John Mark along with them.
\c 13
\s1 The spirit chooses Barnabas and Saul
\p
\v 1 In the assembly at Antioch there were some prophets and teachers: Barnabas, Simeon (called Niger), Lucius frp, Cyrene, Manaen (who grew up with Herod the tetrarch), and Saul.
\v 2 One day when they were ministering to the master and fasting, the pure spirit said, Appoint Barnabas and Saul to serve me and do the work that I have called them to.”
\v 3 So they fasted and prayed and place their hands on the two, and then sent them off.
\s1 The preaching of Birnabi and of Saulu there to Sipri
\p
\v 4 So Barnabas and Saul, having been sent by the pure spirit, went down to Seleucia \add at the coast\add* and then sailed for there on to \add the island of\add* Cyprus.
\v 5 When they arrived in \add the town of\add* Salamis, they proclaimed God's message in the Jewish meeting halls. They also had John as their assistant.
\s1 Sergius believes after Bar-Jesus is blinded
\p
\v 6 They travelled around the island and when they got to Paphos, they met a Jewish man named Bar-Jesus.\f + \fr 13:6 \ft The Greek form of his name was Elymas according to verse 8.\f* He was a sorcerer and false prophet
\v 7 who was with Sergius Paulus the proconsul, an intelligent man. Sergius sent for Barnabas and Saul because he wanted to hear God's message from them,
\v 8 but the sorcerer opposed them and tried to prevent Sergius from believing.
\v 9 So then Saul (the \add Roman\add* form of his name was Paul), filled with the pure spirit looked intently at Bar-Jesus
\v 10 and said, “You're full of all kinds of deceit and fraud you child of the devil. Will you never stop twisting the truth about following the master?
\v 11 Well, look here! The master will extend his power against you and blind you—you'll go a season without seeing the sun!”
\p And immediately he could only see fog and darkness, and needed someone to guide him around by the hand.
\v 12 The proconsul believed when he saw what had happened, and was amazed as he learnt about the master.
\s1 Paul and Barnabas in Pisidia
\p
\v 13 After that, Paul\f + \fr 13:13 \ft From this point on in the text, Paul is referred to by his Roman name as his ministry is largely outside of Israel. (In Israel he seemed to be better known as Saul, the Greek form of his Hebrew name Sha-ul).\f* and his companions sailed from Paphos to Perga in Pamphylia, but John Mark left them and returned to Jerusalem.
\v 14 Paul and his companions, went on from Perga to Pisidian Antioch, where they entered the Jewish meeting hall on the Rest Day and sat down \add with the congregation\add*.
\v 15 After the readings from the Law and from the Prophets,\f + \fr 13:15 \ft The Hebrew Scriptures are divided into the Law, the Prophets, and the Writings.\f* the leaders sent a messenger over to them to ask, “Men, brothers, if you bring any message of encouragement for the congregation, please share it.”
\p
\v 16 So Paul stood up and motioning with his hand started speaking, “Fellow Israelis and every who reveres God, listen to me.
\v 17 The God of the people of Israel chose our ancestors and helped the people to prosper when they were staying in Egypt. Then later he showed his power as he led them out
\v 18 and sustainedXXX them in the wilderness for around forty years.
\v 19 Then having overthrown seven nations in Caanan\x + \xo 13:19: a \xt Deu 7:1; \xo b \xt Josh 14:1.\x*, he passed on that land as an inheritance
\v 20 after around 450 years.
\p “Then he gave them judges through until the time of the prophet Samuel
\v 21 when they requested a king, and God gave them Saul, the son of Kish from the tribe of Benjamin to reign for forty years.
\v 22 After Saul was removed, God chose David to be their king—the man of whom he said, ‘I found David the son of Jesse, a man who wants to obey me and do everything I ask.’
\v 23 Then eventually a descendant of David arrived in Israel as promised—the saviour Jesus.
\v 24 Before he arrived John-the-immerser had publicly preached to all the people of Israel about being immersed \add as a sign\add* of repentance.
\v 25 as John's ministry was nearing an end, he asked, ‘Who do you suspect I am? I'm not the messiah, but he will come after me, and I'm not \add even\add* worthy to undo his sandals.’
\p
\v 26 “Men, brothers, descendants of Abraham and others here who revere God, the teaching about this salvation has been sent to us.
\v 27 The people of Jerusalem and their \add religious\add* leaders didn't recognise this \add Jesus\add* but by their judgement of him, they fulfilled the words of the prophets that are read every Rest Day.
\v 28 Despite not finding even one charge against him worthy of death, they requested Pilate to execute him.
\v 29 And when they had done all the things that \add the prophets\add* had written about him, they took his body down from the stake and placed it in a burial chamber.
\v 30 But God brought him back to life
\v 31 and his followers who had come to Jerusalem from Galilee saw him for several days and now testify about this to the people.
\v 32 So now we are preaching this good message to you that what God promised to our ancestors
\v 33 has now been fulfilled for our descendants now that God brought Jesus back to life just like it's written in the second psalm:
\q1 ‘You are my son;
\q1 today I have borne you.’
\m
\v 34 God brought him back to life, and he's never going to return \add to the grave\add* to decay. As God said,
\q1 ‘I will give David's faithful devout \add things???\add* to you all.’
\m
\v 35 So in another psalm God said,
\q1 ‘You won't allow your devout one to experience decay.’
\m
\v 36 This can't be David, because after he'd served his own generation as God led him, he indeed died and was buried with his ancestors and his body decayed.
\v 37 On the contrary, the one who God raised from the dead never experienced decay.
\v 38 So brothers, let it be known to you all that your sins can now be forgiven through this \add Jesus\add*—the law of Moses was never able to offer you that.
\v 39 Everyone who puts their trust in \add Jesus\add* is able to receive a clean record.
\v 40 But keep your eyes open in case something else the prophets wrote might come true:
\q1
\v 41 ‘Watch you scoffers, and be amazed and die because I'm doing something special during your time.
\q1 Even if someone described it clearly to you all, you still might not believe it.’ ”
\p
\v 42 As they left the meeting hall after the service, the people invited them to speak again the following Rest Day.
\v 43 But when they starting walking away, many people followed after Paul and Barnabas, who then addressed them and encouraged them to continue trusting in God's grace.
\p
\v 44 So on the following Rest Day, nearly everyone in the city had gathered there to hear the message from God.
\v 45 But the Jewish religious leaders became very jealous when they saw the crowds and claimed that Paul's words had slandered God.
\v 46 But Paul and Barnabas responded boldly, “It was necessary for God's message to first be explained in the meeting hall to all of \add the Jews\add*. But since you are rejecting that teaching, you are all judging yourselves to be unworthy of living forever, so instead, we will share it with the non-Jews.
\v 47 Because this is what the master commanded us:
\q1 ‘I have chosen you to be a light for the pagans;
\q2 You will take salvation to the end of the earth.’
\p
\v 48 When the non-Jews heard that, they were very happy and were praising the master's message, and as many as were appointed to \add receive\add* eternal life believed \add it\add*.
\p
\v 49 So from there, the master's message spread throughout the entire region.
\v 50 But the Jewish religious leaders incited some prominent women from the meeting halls and some from the local city government, and they then stirred up persecution against Paul and Barnabas and had them expelled out of their region.
\v 51 So Paul and Barnabas just wiped their hands of that place and continued on to Iconium.
\v 52 Meanwhile the believers \add back in Pisidian Antioch\add* were full of happiness and of the pure spirit.
\c 14
\s1 Paul and Barnabas in Iconium
\p
\v 1 A similar thing happened in Iconium. Paul and Barnabas went into the Jewish meeting hall and spoke in such as way that a lot of both Jews and Greeks believed.
\v 2 But those Jews who didn't believe got the non-Jews emotionally stirred up to oppose the believers.
\v 3 So Paul and Barnabas ended up staying there for quite a while, and as they spoke boldly for the master, he himself confirmed his grace by causing the two of them to be able to do miracles and amazing things.
\v 4 Nvertheless, the people of the city were divided—some agreeing with the \add strict\add* Jews, and others supporting the ambassadors.
\p
\v 5 At one point, both the non-Jews and the strict Jews and their leaders got worked up enough to come to attack them and throw rocks to kill them.
\v 6 However, Paul and Barnabas found out about it and escaped to the Lycaonian cities of Lystra and Derbe and the surrounding region
\v 7 and preached the good message there.
\s1 A miracle in Lystra following by a stoning
\p
\v 8 In Lystra there was a man sitting there who had been unable to use his legs since birth.
\v 9 He was listening to Paul speaking, when Paul looked straight at him and realised that the man had the faith to be healed.
\v 10 So in a loud voice, Paul said, “Stand upright onto your feet.” And the man sprang up and was walking around.
\v 11 The crowd of people who saw what Paul had done began to shout out in Lycaonian, “These two look like men, but they're gods that have come down to us!”
\v 12 They called Barnabas ‘Zeus’ and Paul ‘Hermas’ since he was the main speaker.
\v 13 And the priest of Zeus wanted to sacrifice with the crowds, so he brought bulls and garlands \add of flowers\add* to the city gates from \add the temple\add* on the path to the city.
\p
\v 14 But when the ambassadors Barnabas and Paul heard what was going on, they tore their clothes \add in dismay\add* as they rushed out into the crowd
\v 15 shouting, “Men. Why are you doing all these things? We are only humans just like you all. We were bringing you the good message about abandoning these useless \add sacrifices\add* and turning to the living God who made heaven and the earth and the sea and everything in them.\x + \xo 14:15: \xt Exo 20:11.\x*
\v 16 In previous generations he allowed all the nations to go their own different ways,
\v 17 but he never left himself without evidence of himself—sending good rains from heaven to give you all fruitful seasons with food to fill \add your stomachs\add* and happiness to fill your hearts.”
\v 18 By saying these things, they were eventually just able to restrain the people from sacrificing to them.
\p
\v 19 But some \add strict\add* Jews came over from \add Pisidian\add* Antioch and Iconium and were able to persuade the crowds. They threw rocks at Paul and dragged him outside the city \add gates\add* thinking that he was dead.
\v 20 But as the believers were standing around him, Paul got up and went back into the city, but he left again with Barnabas the next day and went to Derbe.
\s1 Paul and Barnabas return to the sending assembly in Antioch
\p
\v 21 They preached the good message in Derbe, and after giving further training to many of them they returned to Lystra and Iconium and Antioch.
\v 22 There they strengthened the faith of the believers, encouraging them to continue believing and to expect that it's normal to endure a lot of suffering on the path to God's kingdom.
\v 23 They appointed some elders for \add each\add* assembly, they fasted and prayed for the elders—asking the master that they believed in to look after them.
\p
\v 24 After passing through Pisidia, they arrived at Pamphylia
\v 25 and after teaching the master's message in Perga, they went down to \add the coastal city of\add* Attalia.
\v 26 From there, they sailed \add back\add* to \add Syrian\add* Antioch where the congregation had prayed for God's grace to be with them\x + \xo 14:26: \xt 13:3.\x* for the work they had just fulfilled.
\p
\v 27 So when they arrived, they gathered the assembly together and shared about what God had done with them and how he had opened up the door of faith to the non-Jews.
\v 28 Then they stayed with them there for quite a while.
\c 15
\s1 The decision from the Jerusalem elders
\p
\v 1 Then some \add people\add* came \add to Antioch\add* from Judea and were teaching the believers that according to Moses' teachings, you can't be saved unless you've been circumcised.
\v 2 This led to no end of arguement and debate between them and Paul and Barnabas until it was decided that the two of them and some other believers should go to Jerusalem to ask the ambassadors and the elders there about this issue.
\p
\v 3 So indeed the assembly sent the group on their way, and as they passed through Phoenicia and Samaria, they described how non-Jews had bcome believers and this news made the believers there very happy.
\p
\v 4 When they arrived in Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the assembly and the ambassadors and the elders, and they explained how God had used them.
\v 5 But some of the believers who were also members of the Pharisee party stood up and said, “It's quite proper for them to be circumcised and to be commanded to keep the Jewish religious laws.”
\p
\v 6 So the ambassadors and the elders met separately in order to consider the matter further.
\v 7 After a lot of debate, Peter stood up and said, “Men, brothers, all of you here know that some time back, God chose me to be a mouthpiece so that the non-Jews could hear the good message and believe.
\v 8 And God who knows even people's inner thoughts, gave them the same pure spirit as he gave us,
\v 9 and when he purified their minds by the faith, he didn't do anything different for them than he did for us.
\v 10 So why are you all provoking God by putting a load on the shoulders of these believers that neither we, nor our ancestors, were ever able to bear?
\v 11 But we ourselves have believed thanks to the grace of Jesus the master, and they can be saved in just the same way.”
\p
\v 12 The whole group sat in silence, and then they listened to Barnabas and Paul as they described everything that God had done among the non-Jews through them, including miracles and amazing things.
\v 13 Then while they were still silent, Jacob responded, “Men, brothers, listen to me.
\v 14 Simon Peter has told us how God first intervened in order to select a people for himself from among the non-Jews.
\v 15 And this actually agrees with the message that the prophets recorded,
\q1
\v 16 ‘After these things have happened I will return,
\q1 and I will rebuild worship tent from David's time that has collapsed,
\q1 Although it was overturned, I will rebuild and restore it,
\q1
\v 17 so that the remaining people will want to find the master,
\q1 and also the non-Jews who cried out to me.
\q1 The master who is doing these things is saying this,
\q1
\v 18 and planned it this way from eternity.’
\p
\v 19 Because of this, my ruling is not to be troubling the non-Jews who are turning back to God,
\v 20 but to write to them to keep away from anything polluted by idols, from sexual immorality, and from strangled animals and \add eating or drinking\add* blood.
\v 21 Moses' writings have been preached in every city and are read in \add our\add* meeting halls on every Rest Day.
\s1 The letter is carried to Antioch
\p
\v 22 So the ambassadors and elders with all the assembly decided to choose some men to accompany Paul and Barnabas to Antioch, so they chose Judas (nicknamed Barsabbas) and Silas who were leaders among the believers,
\v 23 This is what they wrote: This letter is from the ambassadors and elders, your brothers \add here in Jerusalem\add* to our non-Jewish fellow believers in Antioch and Syria and Ciclia.
\v 24 Since we heard that some people who weren't sent by us came from here and disturbed you all with their upsetting messages,
\v 25 we unanimously agreed to select some men to accompany our dear \add friends\add* Barnabas and Paul back.
\v 26 These are men who have dedicated their lives to our master, Jesus the messiah.
\v 27 So we've sent Judas and Silas and they'll confirm in person what we are writing.
\v 28 It seemed right to the pure spirit and to us to not burden you all with anything more than the following commands:
\v 29 you all must keep away from anything sacrificed to idols, from \add eating or drinking\add* blood or strangled animals, and from sexual immorality. You will do well if you avoid these things. Farewell.
\p
\v 30 So they were sent off and when they arrived at Antioch, they gathered the believers and handed across the letter,
\v 31 and when they read it, they were very happy with the encouraging contents.
\p
\v 32 Judas and Barnabas were both prophets, and said a lot to encourage them and strengthen \add their faith\add*.
\v 33 After they'd stayed there for a while, the believers sent them home carrying greetings from them to the assembly \add back in Jerusalem\add*.
\p
\v 34 ≈
\v 35 But Paul and Barnabas stayed on there in Antioch, teaching them and preaching the good message along with many others.
\s1 Paul and Barnabas go separate ways
\p
\v 36 After a few days, Paul suggested to Barnabas, “Let's go back and visit the believers in each city where we proclaimed the master's message, and see how they're doing.”
\v 37 Barnabas agreed and wanted to take John Mark along with them as well,
\v 38 but Paul didn't want to take him because he had left them in Pamphylia instead of continuing with them in their work.
\v 39 And so it turned into such a disagreement that the two of them each went their different ways. Barnabas took John Mark with him and sailed to Cyprus
\v 40 while Paul chose Silas and they left after being entrusted to the master's grace by the believers.
\v 41 They went through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the assemblies there.
\c 16
\s1 Paul and Silas also take Timothy with them
\p
\v 1 Then Paul went to Derbe and then on to Lystra where a believer named Timothy lived. His mother was a Jewish believer, but his father was Greek.
\v 2 The believers in Lystra and Iconium spoke well of Timothy
\v 3 and Paul wanted him to accompany them on his trip so he circumcised him \add in advance\add* because of the Jews in that region—everyone knew that his father was a Greek.
\v 4 As they passed through various towns, they explained the decision of the ambassadors and elders in Jerusalem about which commands they must adhere to.
\v 5 So the assemblies were strengthened in this way and their numbers were increasing each day.
\s1 Paul's vision in Troas
\p
\v 6 From there, they travelled through Phrygia and the Galatia region, after the pure spirit prevented them from proclaiming the message in Asia.
\v 7 When they got to Mysia, they planned to go on into Bithynia, but Jesus' spirit didn't let them,
\v 8 so after leaving Mysia they went to Troas.
\v 9 During the night, Paul had a vision of a Macedonian man standing there and imploring him, “Come on to Macedonia and help us here.”
\v 10 So as a result of the vision, we decided to go straight to Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to share the good message with them.
\s1 Lydia's enthusiasm at Philippi
\p
\v 11 From Troas we sailed directly to Samothrace, and then on to Neapolis the following day.
\v 12 From there we continued on to Philippi which is a \add Roman\add* colony and the capital city of the Macedonia district where we stayed for several days.
\v 13 On the Rest Days, we went \add down\add* to the river outside the \add city\add* gate where we thought people might be praying, and we spoke to the women who had met there.
\v 14 One of them was Lydia from Thyatira who was a seller of purple goods\f + \fr 16:14 \ft It's possible that Lydia dyed fabric and sold it, or that she actually made and sold the purple dye itself.\f* and although she already worshipped God, the master opened her mind and she readily accepted what Paul was saying.
\v 15 So then Lydia and her household were all \add ceremonially\add* immersed, and then she requested, “If you all consider me to be faithful to the master, come and stay at my place.” So she persuaded us.
\s1 Paul and Silas get thrown into prison
\p
\v 16 One time as we were walking to the prayer meeting, we met a female slave who was possessed by a spirit that enabled her to tell fortunes, and thanks to that, to earn a lot of money for her masters.
\v 17 She walked along behind us and shouted out, “These men are slaves of the highest god and they will be telling you all how to be saved.”
\v 18 After she'd done this for several days, Paul was so frustrated that he turned around and spoke to the spirit \add in her\add*, “I command you by the authority of Jesus the messiah to leave her.”
\p
\v 19 But when her masters realised that their profitable business was about to come to an end, they grabbed Paul and Silas and dragged them to the authorities at the marketplace.
\v 20 They brought them forward to face the magistrates and said, “These Jews are disturbing \add the peace\add* in our city
\v 21 and teaching behaviour that we as Romans can neither accept nor practice.”
\v 22 An \add angry\add* crowd gathered around and the magistrates ordered for Paul and Silas to have their robes torn off and then to be beaten with rods.
\v 23 They were severely beaten and then thrown into prison where the officer was commanded to keep them secure.
\v 24 Because of that, he threw them into the inner cell and locked their feet in stocks.
\p
\v 25 Around midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing praises to God, and the other prisoners were listening to them.
\v 26 Suddenly there was a strong earthquake that shook even the foundations of the prison, and immediately all the prison doors opened up and the chains of all the prisoners came loose.
\v 27 The prison officer woke up, and when he saw that all the prison doors were open, he drew his sword to take his own life as he figured that all the prisoners must have escaped.
\v 28 But Paul shouted out, “Don't harm yourself! We're all still here!”
\p
\v 29 The officer called for torches, then rushed in and knelt down trembling in front of Paul and Silas.
\v 30 Then he escorted them out and asked, “Masters, what do I need to do to be saved?”
\p
\v 31 “Believe in the master Jesus,” they replied, “then you and your household can all be saved.”
\v 32 Then they explained the message about the master to him and all those in his household.
\v 33 Even though it was still the middle of the night, he sponged their wounds, and then him and his household were all immersed straight away.
\v 34 He took Paul and Silas up into his house and gave them a meal, and his whole household were happy because they now believed in God.
\p
\v 35 The next day the magistrates sent officials to tell the jailer to release Paul and Silas.
\p
\v 36 So the officer told Paul, “The magistrates \add sent these officials\add* to order that you two to be released.”
\p
\v 37 But Paul responded, “You mean that after publicly beating us Roman men without a trial, they threw us into prison and now they want to just quietly release us.”
\p
\v 38 So the officials reported this back to the magistrates, and they were quite afraid when they heard that Paul and Silas were Roman \add citizens\add*.
\v 39 So now they came to the prison in person, and appealed to them, and escorting them out of prison themselves, asked them to please leave the city.
\v 40 So after Paul and Silas left the prison, they went to see Lydia and after encouraging the believers there, they left.
\c 17
\s1 Jason gets in trouble in Thessalonica
\p
\v 1 After travelling through Amphipolis and Apollonia, Paul and Silas went to Thessalonica where there was a Jewish meeting hall.
\v 2 Paul's custom was to attend at the local meeting hall on the Rest Day, so he did that, and for three weekends in a row he discussed the scriptures with them,
\v 3 showing them how that it \add had been written\add* that the messiah would suffer and be killed and come back to life, and then explaining, “This Jesus that I've been telling you about is the messiah.”
\v 4 Some of them were persuaded and joined with Paul and Silas, along with a big group of godly Greeks and quite a few prominent women.
\p
\v 5 But some of the other Jews were envious \add of them\add*, and enlisted some of the trouble-makers from the marketplaces to form a mob. They stirred up all the people, and looking for Paul and Silas so they could bring them out, arrived at the house of a man named Jason.
\v 6 But when they realised that Paul and Silas weren't there, they dragged Jason and some other believers off to the city leaders, shouting, “Those two men who gone around upsetting the whole world have now come here as well,
\v 7 and Jason has welcomed them \add into his house\add*. They rebel against Caesar's decrees and claim that Jesus is a rival king.
\v 8 So they stirred up the crowd and the city leaders with these accusations,
\v 9 so the leaders took a heavy fine from Jason and the others, and then released them.
\s1 Many new believers in Berea
\p
\v 10 So the believers immediately sent Paul and Silas off during the night to go to Berea. In Berea they also attended at the Jewish meeting hall
\v 11 and this group were more upper-class than the congregation in Thessalonica. They eagerly accepted the message and examined the scriptures every day to check if what was being taught matched what was written there.
\v 12 Because it did, many of the people believed including quite a few of the prominent Greeks.
\v 13 But when the Jews from Thessalonica found out that God's message was also being proclaimed by Paul there in Berea, they soon turned up to agitate and stir the crowds.
\v 14 So the believers immediately sent Paul off to the coast, but Silas and Timothy both stayed.
\v 15 The ones guiding Paul took him to Athens before they headed back with his instructions for Silas and Timothy to come and join Paul again as soon as possible.
\s1 People of Athens like new ideas
\p
\v 16 While Paul stayed in Athens waiting for them, he was upset in his spirit as he observed how idolatrous the people were.
\v 17 So while he stayed busy having discussions with the Jews and other worshippers from the meeting hall, he also spent time every day with whoever just happened to be around in the marketplace.
\v 18 Some of the Epicurean and Stoic enjoyed discussing things with him, but others just mocked him, “What does this babbler want to talk about now?”
\p But others said, “Seems that he's talking about strange demons,” because he was preaching the good message about Jesus and coming back to life.
\v 19 So they grabbed him and brought him to the Aries Hill \add where the council sat\add* and asked, “Are we allowed to know what this new teaching that you're bringing is about?
\v 20 It seems that you have some surprising ideas for our ears, so we want to hear what it's all about.”
\v 21 (Everyone in Athens and even visitors often took the opportunity either to explain or to listen to any new things.)
\p
\v 22 So Paul stood up in the middle of the gathering on the hill and spoke, “Men of Athens, I've noticed how you all are very religious,
\v 23 because as I was looking around and observing your objects of worship, I even discovered an altar that was inscribed, ‘To the unknown god.’ So without knowing it, you already worship this God that I'm going to tell you about.
\v 24 This God who created the earth and everything in it is the master of heaven and earth. He doesn't live in man-made temples
\v 25 nor can he be repaired by any human hands and he doesn't need to be fed. \add On the contrary\add*, he's the one who gives life and breath and who gives us everything that we need.
\v 26 From one man he made every nationality that lives across all the earth and designated their boundaries and their futures.
\v 27 He made them so that they would try to discover God, and if they did search for him they might find him as he's not far from any one of us
\v 28 because
\q1 ‘We live in him and are moved by him and exist through him.’
\m Even some of your own poets wrote,
\q1 ‘We are all descended from just one.’
\m
\v 29 So since we are God's offspring, we shouldn't be putting gold or silver or stone craftmanship in the same class as the divine.
\v 30 In fact God overlooked times of such ignorance in the past, but now he's informing everyone and requiring them to repent
\v 31 because he's set a date for when he's going to be fairly judging the world. He's already appointed the judge who everyone can have faith in because he brought him back to life from the dead.
\p
\v 32 When they heard about a dead person coming back to life, some started mocking but others said, “We'd like to hear more about this from you another time.”
\v 33 So Paul left at that stage
\v 34 but some people joined with him and believed, including Dionysius who was a council member, a woman named Damaris, and others as well.
\c 18
\s1 Paul resides in Corinth for some time
\p
\v 1 After this, Paul left Athens and travelled to Corinth.
\v 2 There he came across a Jew named Aquila who had been born in Pontus but who had recently moved from Italy along with his wife Priscilla because \add Emperor\add* Claudius had ordered all Jews to leave Rome. So Paul approached them,
\v 3 and since they worked in the same trade, he ended up staying with them and they worked together in their craft of tent-making.
\v 4 On every Rest Day, Paul debated in the Jewish meeting hall, and was persuading both Jews and Greeks.
\p
\v 5 However when Silas and Timothy arrived from Macedonia, Paul was able to devote his full time to the message—demonstrating to the Jews that Jesus is the \add promised\add* messiah.
\v 6 But when they opposed \add the message\add* and made false accusations, he \add publicly\add* brushed \add the dust\add* off his clothes\f + \fr 18:6 \ft In the culture, this was a demonstration that you're not responsible for their decision(s).\f* and said, “Your future deaths are your own problem. I'm innocent \add of your guilt.\add* From now on, I'll going to the non-Jews.”
\v 7 So Paul left there, and went to stay at the house of a man named Titus Justus who worshipped God and whose house was next-door to the meeting hall.
\v 8 Krispo the meeting hall leader and all his household decided to follow the master, and many of the Corinthians believed after they heard \add the message\add* and were immersed.
\p
\v 9 Then the master spoke to Paul one night in a vision, “Don't be afraid and stay silent, but keep speaking out
\v 10 because I am with you and no one can mistreat you here because there are many of my people in this city.”
\v 11 So Paul stayed on for eighteen months, teaching God's message to the people there.
\p
\v 12 Then at the time when Gallio was the proconsul of Achaia, the Jews united against Paul and brought a case to the tribunal against him
\v 13 saying, “This man is going against the law by persuading people to be worshipping \add his\add* God.”
\p
\v 14 But as Paul opening his mouth to speak, Gallio said to the Jews, “I would have accepted this charge if it was a serious wrong or evil crime and would have listened to you Jews.
\v 15 However, since it's a question about a message and names and your own law, you all can see to it yourselves because I don't want to get involved in judging things like that.”
\v 16 So he sent them away from the tribunal,
\v 17 but they grabbed Sosthenes, the leader from the meeting hall, and beat him up right there in front of the tribunal. But Gallio took action to stop them.
\s1 Paul returns to Syrian Antioch
\p
\v 18 Paul stayed on for quite a few days after that, then he farewelled the believers and went to Cenchrea where he had his hair cut as was the custom for someone making a vow. Then taking Priscilla and Aquila with him, he sailed towards Syria.
\v 19 When they arrived at Ephesus, he left the other two there while he went into the Jewish meeting hall and had a discussion with the Jews there.
\v 20 They asked him to remain longer, but he turned them down
\v 21 although as he gave his farewells, he said, “I'll come back here again if God wills it,” then he sailed on from Ephesus.
\p
\v 22 When he landed at Caesarea, he went \add to Jerusalem\add* and greeted the assembly there before continuing on to Antioch.
\v 23 He stayed there for some time before travelling through the regions of Galatia and Phrygia strengthening \add the faith of\add* the believers \add through his teaching\add*.
\s1 Apollos teaches in Ephesus and Corinth
\p
\v 24 Meanwhile a Jewish man named Apollos (who had been born in \add the city of\add* Alexandria) arrived in Ephesus. He knew the \add Hebrew\add* scriptures well
\v 25 and had been taught about the master's way. Being a very enthusiastic person, he started teaching about Jesus, even though he didn't know about being filled with the spirit.\x + \xo 18:25: \xt 2:1-4.\x*
\v 26 So Apollos started speaking out boldly in the Jewish meeting hall. Priscilla and Aquila listened to him, then asked to speak with him privately and explained God's way more accurately.
\v 27 Now Apollos wanted to go to Achaia, so the believers encouraged him and sent a letter ahead of him to tell the believers there to welcome him, so when he arrived there, he was able to contribute a lot to those who through God's grace had also become believers.
\v 28 Apollos was \add also\add* able to thoroughly refute the arguments of the Jews and used the scriptures to show that Jesus is the messiah.
