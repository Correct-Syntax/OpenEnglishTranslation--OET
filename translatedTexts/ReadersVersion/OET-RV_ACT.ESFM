\mt2 The second account by
\mt1 Luke
\mt2 commonly called
\mt1 Acts
\is1 Introduction
\is2 Author
\ip This account commonly known as \bk The Acts of the missionaries of Yeshua the Messiah\bk*, is the continuation of \bk The Good Message according to Luke\bk*, and unlike most other Bibles, the \em Open English Translation\em* places these two accounts one after the other.
\is2 This account
\ip The main purpose of this account is to tell about the actions of the first followers of Yeshua the messiah. The spirit of the master helped them to proclaim good message about him “in Jerusalem and all across \add the provinces of\add* Judea and Samaria, and all the way to the furtherest parts of the planet” (1:8).
\ip This document has three divisions related to the expanding circles as the good message from Yeshua the messiah spread wider and wider: (1) In \bd Jerusalem\bd* where the believers start to get organised after Yeshua ascended up into the clouds; (2) the work and the message spreads wider out to all of the district of \bd Judea\bd*; and (3) spreading more widely again around the Mediterranean Ocean and all the way to \bd Rome\bd*.
\ip It's also documented here about how God's spirit came to the believers as they were together in a room in Jerusalem at the Feast of Pentecost (fifty days after The Passover). The spirit helps and gives wisdom and strength to the believers and teachers of believers.

\s1 Introduction
\p
\v 1 \x + \xo 1:1: \xt Luk 1:1-4.\x*Dear Theophilus¦82412, I wrote my first¦82406 account¦82407 about all the things¦82410 that Yeshua¦82416 began¦82414 to do and¦82419 to teach¦82420
\v 2 until¦82421 the day¦82423 when he was taken¦82433 up\x + \xo 1:1: \xt Luk 24:51.\x* \add into the sky\add* after, with the help of the pure¦82430 spirit¦82429, having¦82425 commanded¦82425 the missionaries¦82427 that he had chosen¦82432.
\s1 Yeshua, alive, tells them to wait
\p
\v 3 After the time¦82447 of his suffering¦82448, Yeshua presented¦82443 himself¦82444 to them in ways that were infallible proofs¦82452 \add that he was alive again\add*—appearing¦82457 to them and telling them about God's kingdom¦82466.
\v 4 \x + \xo 1:4: \xt Luk 24:49.\x*Once when they were together¦82470, he told them, “Don't leave Jerusalem¦82478, but wait there for what was promised¦82484 by the father¦82486, as you all have \add already\add* heard¦82488 me say.
\v 5 \x + \xo 1:5: \xt Mat 3:11; Mrk 1:8; Luk 3:16; Jn 1:33.\x*John¦82496 immersed \add people\add* in water¦82499, but you all will be immersed in the pure¦82506 spirit¦82504 in just a few days¦82516.”
\s1 Yeshua's ascension
\p
\v 6 So when they were \add next\add* gathered together¦82524, they asked him¦82528, “Master¦82530, is this now the time when you'll be restoring¦82536 the kingdom¦82539 to Israel?”\f + \fr 1:6 \ft At the time of asking, Israelis were burdened under the rule and taxes of the Roman occupiers.\f*
\p
\v 7 But Yeshua responded to them, “You don't¦82551 need to know¦82554 the times¦82555 or seasons¦82557 \add when future events will happen\add*—it's the father¦82560 who decides all that.
\v 8 \x + \xo 1:8: \xt Mat 28:19; Mrk 16:15; Luk 24:47-48.\x*However, you all will be receiving¦82567 power¦82568 when the pure¦82571 spirit¦82572 lands on you. Then you'll tell \add people\add* about me in Jerusalem¦82582 and all across \add the provinces of\add* Judea¦82587 and Samaria¦82589, and all the way to the furtherest parts of the planet.
\v 9 \x + \xo 1:9: \xt Mrk 16:19; Luk 24:50-51.\x*After he'd said¦82598 that and while they were still looking at him, he was lifted¦82605 up \add into the sky\add* until they could no longer see him because of the cloud\add s\add*.
\p
\v 10 As they¦82620 stood¦82630 there staring into the sky¦82623 after he'd gone, suddenly two¦82629 men¦82628 in white¦82637 clothes¦82634 were standing beside them
\v 11 and said, “You men from Galilee¦82643! Why are you still standing there looking¦82646 up at the sky? This Yeshua¦82653 who has been taken¦82655 up away from you into heaven will come back in the same way that you saw him go up into heaven.”
\s1 Matthias replaces Judas Iscariot
\p
\v 12 Then¦82674 they¦82672 walked down the Mount¦82676 of Olives¦82679 and returned¦82672 to Jerusalem¦82683 which¦82680 was less than a kilometre away.
\v 13 \x + \xo 1:13: \xt Mat 10:2-4; Mrk 3:16-19; Luk 6:14-16.\x*They went¦82697 into the upstairs¦82696 room where¦82698 they were staying¦82700—Peter and John¦82706, Jacob and Andrew¦82711, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew¦82715 and Matthew¦82717, Jacob (son of Alpheus), Simon¦82723 (the Zealot member¦82725), and Judas (son of Jacob).
\v 14 They were united in their ongoing prayers¦82736, along with Maria¦82746 the mother¦82749 of Yeshua¦82751, and his¦82756 brothers¦82755.
\p
\v 15 Then one day, Peter stood¦82763 up in the meeting of the believers¦82769 (about¦82782 120¦82784 of them) and¦82773 said¦82771,
\v 16 “Brothers¦82787, it was necessary¦82788 for the scripture¦82792 to be fulfilled¦82790, where the pure¦82799 spirit¦82797 had spoken¦82795 previously¦82795 through David¦82802 about Judas¦82804, the one who guided¦82807 those that arrested¦82809 Yeshua¦82811
\v 17 because Judas was one of us and¦82818 took his part in our work¦82824.
\p
\v 18 \x + \xo 1:18-19: \xt Mat 27:3-8.\x*(Judas had bought a field with the money¦82833 he had received for his treachery, and when he had fallen down \add in that field\add*, his stomach had burst¦82840 open and his intestines¦82846 had slid out \add on the ground\add*.
\v 19 So¦82866 everyone in Jerusalem¦82856 started calling¦82858 that place ‘The field of blood¦82871’.)
\p
\v 20 \x + \xo 1:20: a \xt Psa 69:25; \xo b \xt Psa 109:8.\x*Now it was written¦82872 in the scroll¦82875 of songs¦82876:
\q1 ‘Let his place become¦82877 deserted¦82881 with no one living¦82887 there,’
\m and
\q1 ‘Let another¦82896 person take¦82895 his position.’
\p
\v 21 So now it's appropriate¦82897 for one of the men¦82902 that has been with us for the whole time¦82906 that the master¦82916 Yeshua¦82917 was interacting with us,
\v 22 \x + \xo 1:22: a \xt Mat 3:16; Mrk 1:9; Luk 3:21; \xo b \xt Mrk 16:19; Luk 24:51.\x*from Yeshua's immersion¦82922 by John¦82923 until¦82925 the day¦82927 that he was lifted up from us \add into the clouds\add*—a witness¦82932 of the resurrection¦82934—to fill this position.
\p
\v 23 So they¦82943 selected two¦82945 men: Joseph¦82946 Barsabbas¦82950 (nicknamed Justus¦82953) and¦82954 Matthias¦82955.
\v 24 Then they requested¦82958, “Master¦82963, you know everyone's inner thoughts, so reveal¦82966 to us which¦82967 of these¦82970 two¦82972 that you have chosen¦82968
\v 25 to take this position of service¦82984 and being an missionary—the position that Judas¦82992 deserted to go to his own place.”
\v 26 So they drew straws and Matthias¦83011 was marked so he was chosen¦83015 to join the eleven¦83019 missionaries¦83020.
\c 2
\s1 God's spirit arrives and many get saved
\p
\v 1 \x + \xo 2:1: \xt Lev 23:15-21; Deu 16:9-11.\x*When the Day of Pentecost actually arrived, the believers met together¦83041 in the same¦83045 room¦83045.
\v 2 Suddenly there was a noise in the sky that sounded¦83053 like a strong¦83057 wind¦83056, then it¦83060 filled¦83060 the entire¦83062 house¦83064 where¦83065 they¦83066 were sitting¦83068.
\v 3 They saw what looked like tongues¦83073 of fire¦83075 that kept dividing¦83072\f + \fr 3:1 \ft See https://www.billmounce.com/monday-with-mounce/what-%E2%80%9Cdivided-tongue%E2%80%9D-acts-2-3-0\f* and¦83076 then settling down on each one of them.
\v 4 In this way they were all filled¦83086 with the pure¦83090 spirit and began¦83092 speaking in other¦83095 languages¦83096 as the spirit enabled them.
\p
\v 5 At the time, there were godly¦83116 Jews¦83114 staying¦83112 in Jerusalem¦83109 that had come from other countries¦83120 all around the world.
\v 6 When they heard this noise, lots of people¦83132 came¦83130 to investigate but they were confused¦83134 because¦83136 they heard the believers talking¦83145 in their¦83149 own languages¦83144 \add from around the world\add*.
\v 7 They were astounded¦83150 and¦83154 marvelled¦83155, asking, “Wow, aren't these¦83164 people talking¦83167 all Galileans¦83169?
\v 8 So how come we're hearing¦83173 them speak the languages¦83178 of the countries where we were born?
\v 9 There's people here from Parthia¦83185, Media¦83187, Elam, Mesopotamia¦83194, Judea¦83195, Cappadocia¦83198, Pontus¦83199, Asia,
\v 10 Phrygia, Pamphylia, Egypt¦83207, Libya (near Cyrene), and visitors¦83219 from Rome,
\v 11 Crete, and Arabia¦83228. Some are Jews and some are non-Jews who've converted¦83224 \add to Judaism\add*. And we¦83230 can hear¦83230 them talking¦83231 about God¦83239 in our¦83234 languages¦83235.”
\v 12 Everyone was amazed¦83240 and¦83243 totally puzzled, asking each other, “What's¦83254 going on here?”
\v 13 But others¦83261 scoffed¦83263 and said, “Ha, they've just had too much to drink.”
\s1 Peter's sermon
\p
\v 14 So the twelve stood¦83274 up and Peter told the crowd in a loud voice¦83286, “People of Judea¦83294 and everyone staying¦83298 in Jerusalem¦83299. Listen to me so that I can explain this to you.
\v 15 This group is not drunk¦83319 like you're all thinking¦83317, because¦83323 it's still mid-morning,
\v 16 but¦83330 you're seeing what the prophet¦83337 Joel¦83338 wrote about:
\q1
\v 17 \x + \xo 2:17-21: \xt Joel 2:28-32 (LXX).\x*God said, ‘In the last days¦83346 I will pour out my¦83355 spirit¦83354 on all humanity—your children will tell of future events, your young¦83374 men will see visions¦83376, and your old men will have dreams¦83384 \add from God\add*.
\v 18 I will pour my spirit¦83409 out on my male and female slaves¦83392 and they¦83413 will tell of future events.
\v 19 I will do unusual things with the stars and planets, and also down on the earth¦83425 below¦83426: blood¦83427, fire¦83429, and clouds of smoke¦83432.
\v 20 I'll make the sun¦83434 go dark and the moon¦83442 go blood¦83444 red. This will happen before¦83445 the great¦83452 victorious day¦83449 of the coming of the master¦83450.
\v 21 Then everyone¦83457 who relies on the name¦83463 and authority of the master¦83465 will be saved¦83466.’
\p
\v 22 “Fellow Israelis, listen to this account: You yourselves¦83504 know that God did miracles¦83487 through Yeshua¦83474 from Nazareth¦83476, and he fulfilled signs¦83491 \add from the scriptures\add*—in fact God did this right in front of you.
\v 23 \x + \xo 2:23: \xt Mat 27:35; Mrk 15:24; Luk 23:33; Jn 19:18.\x*Then as part of God's plan and foreknowledge¦83511, this Yeshua was taken to the authorities by those who didn't follow their own laws, and you¦83521 all killed¦83521 him by having him executed¦83520 on a pole.
\v 24 \x + \xo 2:24: \xt Mat 28:5-6; Mrk 16:6; Luk 24:5.\x*But God¦83525 released him from the agonies¦83529 of death and brought him back to life—death couldn't restrain¦83537 him.
\v 25 \x + \xo 2:25-28: \xt Psa 16:8-11 (LXX).\x*As David¦83541 wrote,
\q1 ‘I foresaw¦83548 the master¦83550 always being in front of me. I refuse to be afraid because¦83556 he's there on my¦83559 right¦83558.
\q1
\v 26 Because¦83564 of that, I was happy and spoke out my¦83568 praises. My¦83568 whole body lives in anticipation
\v 27 because¦83586 you will never abandon¦83588 my¦83591 soul¦83590 in Hades¦83594, nor will you allow the godly¦83598 one to decay¦83601.
\v 28 You showed me the roads to life¦83606. You fill me with gladness¦83609 because of your¦83614 presence¦83613.’
\p
\v 29 “Fellow Israelis, we can tell you¦83622 all with confidence¦83620 that our patriarch¦83625 David¦83626 both died¦83629 and was buried¦83631, and his¦83636 tomb¦83635 is still here with us today.
\v 30 \x + \xo 2:30: \xt Psa 132:11; 2Sam 7:12-13.\x*So because he was a prophet¦83645, and knowing¦83650 that God¦83656 has promised him to seat one of his descendants on his throne¦83675,
\v 31 he was foretelling the resurrection¦83682 of the messiah¦83684 who was neither¦83686 ‘abandoned¦83688 in Hades¦83695 nor did his¦83700 body decay¦83703.’
\v 32 Then God¦83710 raised¦83708 this Yeshua¦83707 back to life and we're all witnesses¦83716 of that.
\v 33 Now he's sitting at God's right¦83719 hand¦83719, and having received¦83733 the promise¦83727 of the pure¦83731 spirit¦83729 from the father¦83736, he poured¦83737 this out which¦83739 you are all seeing¦83745 and hearing¦83747 \add today\add*.
\v 34 \x + \xo 2:34-35: \xt Psa 110:1.\x*You see, David¦83750 never went up to the heavens¦83754, but he himself¦83759 said,
\q1 ‘The master said to my master: Sit down at my right¦83769
\q1
\v 35 until¦83771 I defeat your¦83777 enemies¦83776.’
\p
\v 36 “So let all Israel know that this Yeshua¦83806 that you¦83808 executed¦83809 on a pole, God¦83801 made him¦83794 both the master¦83792 and¦83795 the messiah¦83796.”
\p
\v 37 When the people heard¦83815 that, they were deeply troubled and asked Peter and the other¦83835 missionaries¦83836, “What should we¦83839 do then, brothers¦83842?”
\p
\v 38 Peter responded, “Turn away \add from your sins\add* and each one of you needs to be immersed¦83854 by the authority of Yeshua¦83863 the messiah¦83864. Then your sins will be forgiven¦83866 and you all will receive¦83872 the gift¦83874 of the pure¦83876 spirit¦83877,
\v 39 because that promise¦83883 is to you all and your¦83888 children¦83886 and to their descendants—to anyone who will call out to the master¦83900, our¦83903 God¦83902.”
\p
\v 40 Then Peter shared further teaching with them and¦83911 encouraged them to save themselves out from this corrupt generation¦83918.
\v 41 Because of that, those who welcomed¦83927 his¦83931 teaching were immersed¦83932 and about¦83942 three¦83943 thousand¦83943 people were added¦83934 to their numbers that day¦83938.
\v 42 They continued listening to the teaching¦83950 of the missionaries¦83952, and in building their relationships with each other, and in breaking¦83960 bread¦83962 and praying together.
\s1 The lifestyle of the early believers
\p
\v 43 They were serious in their learning about God, and the missionaries¦83981 did many miracles and signs¦83977 of God's power in Jerusalem and all the people wanted to be right with God.
\v 44 \x + \xo 2:44: \xt Acts 4:32-35.\x*All those who did believe¦83997 were united in purpose¦84001 and¦84002 had shared use of many things¦84006.
\v 45 Some sold their properties¦84010 and possessions¦84015 and divided¦84019 them among the group so that everyone had everything they needed.
\v 46 Each day¦84033 they¦84052 \add worshipped\add* together at the temple¦84040 and also went to various homes to break¦84047 bread¦84051 together. They talked about Yeshua at their mealtimes without sophisication,
\v 47 praising¦84060 God¦84062 and being popular with the people¦84070, and every¦84077 day¦84078 the master¦84073 was adding¦84074 more that were being saved¦84076.
\c 3
\s1 A lame man starts bouncing around
\p
\v 1 One afternoon around 3pm, Peter and John¦84097 were going¦84098 to the prayer¦84110 meeting in the temple¦84101.
\v 2 Now there was a man¦84117 who had been lame from birth, and every¦84128 day¦84129 he was placed beside a door¦84132 into the temple—an entry named ‘Beautiful¦84137 Door’. From there he could beg from the people entering¦84144 the temple.
\v 3 He saw Peter and¦84158 John¦84159 about to enter¦84162 into the temple¦84165, so he¦84164 asked them for a donation,
\v 4 but Peter and John¦84181, looking closely at him¦84178 said¦84184, “Look at us!”
\v 5 So the man grabbed onto them, expecting¦84194 to get¦84200 given¦84200 something¦84195 by them.
\v 6 But Peter said¦84201, “I don't¦84210 have any silver or gold¦84209, but I'll give you what I do have. With the authority of Yeshua¦84222 the messiah¦84223 from Nazareth¦84225, \add I command you\add* to walk¦84229.”
\v 7 Then Peter grabbed¦84231 the man by the right¦84234 hand¦84235 and pulled him upwards. Immediately the man's feet¦84246 and ankles¦84251 were strengthened¦84243
\v 8 and he jumped up and stood¦84255 and started walking and went into the temple¦84265 with them, walking and skipping and praising¦84270 God¦84272.
\v 9 All the people¦84278 \add there\add* saw¦84274 him¦84279 walking¦84280 and¦84281 praising¦84282 \add \add* God¦84285,
\v 10 and recognising¦84286 that he was the man who usually sat \add outside\add* begging at the ‘Beautiful¦84304 Door’ of the temple¦84309, they were astonished and astounded at what had happened¦84319 to him.
\s1 Peter's sermon in the temple
\p
\v 11 As the man clung onto Peter and John¦84335, all the people¦84344 ran¦84337 to see them in Solomon's¦84358 Porch and were very amazed¦84361.
\v 12 But when Peter saw \add the crowd\add*, he¦84371 answered¦84368 their thoughts¦84385, “Fellow Israelis, why are you all puzzled about this, and why are you staring at us as if this man is¦84398 walking¦84398 because of \em our\em* power¦84389 or closeness to God.”
\v 13 \x + \xo 3:13: \xt Exo 3:15.\x*The god of Abraham¦84402, Isaac¦84406, and Jacob¦84410—the god of our¦84416 fathers¦84415—gave honour to his¦84421 servant¦84420, Yeshua¦84422, who you handed over \add to be killed\add* and then you rejected him when Pilate¦84437 had judged¦84439 him and wanted to release him.
\v 14 \x + \xo 3:14: \xt Mat 27:15-23; Mrk 15:6-14; Luk 23:13-23; Jn 19:12-15.\x*You disowned¦84452 this man¦84456 who was innocent and sinless, and instead you requested¦84454 that a murderer¦84457 be released to you.
\v 15 However in doing so, you¦84465 killed¦84465 the creator of life¦84464, who God¦84468 then raised¦84469 from the dead¦84471 as we¦84474 can attest.
\v 16 Now it's \add our\add* faith in the authority of Yeshua that has strengthened¦84490 \add the legs\add* of this man that you have seen and that you already knew—this authority and faith that comes from Yeshua completely¦84503 healed this man right in front¦84505 of you all.
\p
\v 17 So now, friends, I know that you did \add all\add* that in ignorance¦84518, just like your¦84525 leaders,
\v 18 but \add actually\add* God¦84528 was fulfilling¦84542 what he had had written by the prophets¦84536, that the messiah¦84540 should suffer¦84538.
\v 19 Because of that, \add you¦84553 all need to\add* repent¦84544 and¦84546 turn¦84548 back \add to God\add* so that your¦84553 sins¦84555 can be erased,
\v 20 and then times¦84561 of refreshing¦84562 will come¦84560 from the presence¦84564 of the master¦84566, and so that he may send¦84568 Yeshua¦84574 the messiah¦84573 who has been appointed¦84570, back \add to save\add* you.
\v 21 \add For now\add* it¦84578 is appropriate¦84578 for heaven¦84579 to receive¦84581 him¦84601, until¦84582 the times¦84583 of restoration¦84585 of everything, which¦84587 \add again\add* God¦84590 has had written by the faithful prophets¦84602.
\v 22 \x + \xo 3:22: \xt Deu 18:15,18 (LXX).\x*Indeed¦84604 Moses said¦84606, ‘The master¦84617, our¦84620 God¦84619 will raise up a prophet¦84613 for you that's like one of your¦84626 own brothers¦84624. You must listen to everything he says—whatever he tells you.
\v 23 \x + \xo 3:23: \xt Deu 18:19.\x*Everyone who doesn't listen to that prophet¦84651 will end up totally destroyed¦84653 and not part of \add God's\add* people¦84657.’
\v 24 Similarly, the prophets¦84662 from Samuel onwards spoke in turn, and when they spoke they foretold these¦84678 \add current\add* days¦84677.
\v 25 \x + \xo 3:25: \xt Gen 22:18.\x*And you are the descendants of those prophets¦84684, and part of the agreement between God¦84692 and your ancestors¦84696, when he told Abraham¦84701, ‘All the families¦84712 in the world will be blessed¦84709 by one of your descendants.’
\v 26 God¦84719 had raised¦84717 up his¦84723 servant¦84722 and sent¦84725 him to you \add Jews\add* first¦84716, to bless¦84728 you by turning¦84733 each of you away from your¦84742 own wicked¦84740 \add behaviour\add*.”

\s1 Peter and John are threatened by the religious leaders
\p
\v 1 While Peter and John were still talking¦84743 to the people¦84748, the chief¦84755 priests¦84755 and a temple¦84761 officer¦84759 and some from the Sadducee sect approached¦84752 them
\v 2 because¦84770 they were very upset about what they had been teaching¦84772 the people¦84775, including preaching¦84778 that Yeshua¦84782 could give life to the dead¦84792.
\v 3 So they arrested¦84794 the two, and as it¦84808 was already¦84811 evening¦84810, they put them in jail¦84803 overnight.
\v 4 Despite this, many people who had heard¦84815 their message¦84817 trusted \add in Yeshua\add* and¦84819 the number¦84822 of men¦84826 who were believers¦84818 grew to around 5,000.
\p
\v 5 Then the next day¦84834, the religious leaders and the elders¦84847 and the religious teachers¦84851 gathered¦84837 together¦84837 in Jerusalem¦84854
\v 6 along with those descended¦84877 from high priests, including Annas¦84857 the current high priest¦84861 and Caiaphas¦84864 and John¦84869 and Alexander¦84872.
\v 7 After \add having¦84880 Peter and John brought in and\add* standing them in the middle, they¦84885 began to ask, “Under what authority or name¦84892 did you¦84897 do this?”
\p
\v 8 Then Peter, having¦84900 been filled¦84900 with the pure¦84902 spirit¦84901, said¦84903 to them, “Rulers¦84906 of the people¦84908 and¦84909 elders¦84910,
\v 9 if we're being¦84916 questioned today¦84915 about a good¦84920 deed done to a man¦84921 who couldn't walk and which resulted in his healing,
\v 10 then you all need to know, and the people¦84937 of Israel should also know that it was done under the authority and name of Yeshua¦84944 the messiah¦84945. He was the man from Nazareth¦84947 that you executed¦84950 on a pole, but who God¦84953 brought back to life. It was by his authority and name that this man can now stand before¦84961 you without deformity.
\v 11 \x + \xo 4:11: \xt Psa 118:22.\x*This Yeshua is
\q1 ‘the stone¦84967 which¦84977 was rejected by you¦84972 builders¦84975,
\q1 has now become¦84978 the \add vital\add* cornerstone¦84981.’
\m
\v 12 We can't be saved by anyone else, because¦84993 there's¦84997 no other¦84986 name¦84995 or authority that's been given¦85005 in the entire world under¦85000 which¦85009 people¦85007 can be saved.
\p
\v 13 The assembled leaders were amazed¦85030 saw the boldness¦85019 of Peter and John¦85021 who they knew to be illiterate¦85026, working-class men¦85025, and then recognised¦85031 that they had been with Yeshua¦85038.
\v 14 But since the man¦85043 who was no longer deformed was standing there with them, there was nothing¦85051 that they¦85052 could really accuse them of.
\v 15 So they¦85065 had them removed from the room, and asked each other,
\v 16 “What should we do with these¦85075 fellows? By now everyone in Jerusalem's heard about the miracle they did, and we have no way to rebuff it¦85096.”
\v 17 However, we have to stop it spreading¦85106 even further, so maybe we should ban them from speaking¦85120 about this name¦85123 \add or authority\add* to anyone.
\v 18 So they called¦85134 them back in and decreed that they weren't allowed to preach or teach¦85145 under the name¦85148 \add or authority\add* of Yeshua¦85150 anymore.
\p
\v 19 But Peter and¦85155 John¦85157 answered¦85158, “You judge \add for yourselves\add* whether¦85164 it's right¦85165 in God's eyes to listen to you¦85170 rather¦85172 than to him?
\v 20 As for us, we're not able to be silent about what we saw¦85183 and heard¦85186.”
\v 21 So after making some further¦85191 threats¦85191, the leaders sent¦85192 them off. They hadn't been able to find anything to punish¦85200 them for because¦85212 the people¦85206 were all praising God¦85211 for what had happened
\v 22 because the man¦85222 who had miraculously recovered was over forty¦85219 years¦85215 old.
\s1 The believers ask God for power
\p
\v 23 After Peter and John had been released, they went to their¦85236 own \add group\add* and told them what the chief¦85245 priests¦85245 and elders¦85248 had said¦85249.
\v 24 \x + \xo 4:24: \xt Exo 20:11; Neh 9:6; Psa 146:6.\x*When they heard¦85253 this, they all began to pray out loud to God¦85265, saying, “Master¦85269, you¦85270 created heaven¦85276 and the earth¦85279 and the sea¦85282 and everything in them.
\v 25 \x + \xo 4:25-26: \xt Psa 2:1-2 (LXX).\x*You spoke \add long ago\add* by the pure¦85295 spirit¦85294 through our¦85292 ancestor who was your¦85303 servant¦85302, David¦85300, when you¦85303 said¦85304,
\q1 ‘Why are the other nations angry and¦85309 their peoples¦85310 tried new \add ideas\add*?”
\q1
\v 26 The earthly¦85318 kings¦85316 and rulers¦85321 stood a worked together¦85322 against the master¦85328 and against his¦85333 messiah¦85332.’
\m
\v 27 \x + \xo 4:27: a \xt Luk 23:7-11; \xo b \xt Mat 27:1-2; Mrk 15:1; Luk 23:1; Jn 18:28-29.\x*And indeed Herod¦85352 and Pontius¦85355 Pilate¦85356 met with the pagan¦85358 \add Romans\add* and the peoples¦85360 of Israel to conspire against¦85343 your¦85347 pure¦85345 servant¦85346 Yeshua¦85349 who you chose.
\v 28 Then they did exactly what your¦85366 power and plan had already decided would happen.
\v 29 So now, master¦85376, see their¦85382 threats¦85380 and¦85383 help us, your slaves¦85386, to be able to proclaim your message¦85394 with boldness¦85390.
\v 30 Let us experience your power to heal and do miracles and things that confirm the scriptures by means of the name¦85415 \add and authority\add* of your pure¦85417 servant¦85418, Yeshua¦85420.”
\p
\v 31 As they finished their¦85423 requests, the place¦85426 where they had met was shaken¦85424 and all of them were filled¦85432 with the pure¦85438 spirit¦85439, and they \add went out and\add* proclaimed God's message¦85443 with boldness¦85447.
\s1 The believers share their wealth and possessions
\p
\v 32 \x + \xo 4:32: \xt Acts 2:44-45.\x*And so the group of believers¦85456 were united in their will and attitude. No one claimed anything¦85475 to be their own, but they shared everything they had.
\v 33 The missionaries¦85500 of the master¦85508, Yeshua¦85509, experienced great power¦85494 and proclaimed the truth about how he came back to life, and \add God's\add* favour was with them.
\v 34 None of them were lacking anything, because¦85530 any of them who owned properties¦85533 or houses¦85536 would sell them and bring¦85541 the proceeds.
\v 35 They would lay them down in front of the missionaries¦85553, and from there it¦85554 was distributed¦85554 around according to what needs each person had.
\p
\v 36 Joseph¦85565 (a Levite born in Cyprus who was nicknamed ‘Barnabas¦85570’, meaning ‘Encourager’, by the missionaries¦85574)
\v 37 owned a field¦85589 which he sold, and brought¦85591 the money¦85593 and put it down in front of the missionaries¦85601.
\c 5
\s1 The death of Ananias and Sapphira
\p
\v 1 But in contrast, a couple named Ananias¦85605 and Sapphira¦85609 sold a property¦85615
\v 2 but agreed together to hide some of the proceeds. So Ananias brought¦85629 a smaller amount and put it¦85637 down in front of the missionaries¦85636.
\v 3 Then Peter said¦85639, “Ananias¦85645, why has Satan¦85653 filled¦85649 your¦85656 mind¦85655 such that you would lie to the pure¦85662 spirit¦85660 and keep aside some of the proceeds of the property¦85671?
\v 4 Wasn't it yours before it was sold? And even when it was sold, the money was still yours. Why did you decide¦85688 to handle it like this? It wasn't people¦85700 that you're lying¦85699 to, but God¦85703.”
\v 5 When Ananias¦85708 heard that, he fell down and stopped¦85714 breathing¦85714. Everyone who heard about it felt very afraid,
\v 6 and the young¦85727 men¦85727 there stood up and covered¦85728 his \add body\add*, carried it out, and buried¦85732 him.
\p
\v 7 After about three¦85738 hours¦85737, Ananias' wife¦85742 came in, not knowing¦85745 anything about what had happened.
\v 8 Peter checked, “Is it true that you¦85767 guys sold the property¦85765 for such-and-such an amount?”
\p “Yes, for that amount,” she¦85768 replied.
\p
\v 9 But Peter said¦85776 to her, “Why did the two of you agree¦85783 to test the spirit¦85788 of the master¦85790? The guys who just buried¦85795 your¦85798 husband¦85797 are just out the door¦85802, and they'll carry you out as well.”
\v 10 Sapphira immediately¦85810 fell down in front of him¦85815 and stopped¦85817 breathing¦85817. Then the young¦85821 men¦85821 came in and found¦85822 her dead¦85825, so they took \add her body out\add* and buried¦85831 her with her husband¦85834.
\v 11 So the entire¦85841 assembly¦85843 of believers became¦85837 very afraid, along with every else who heard about these¦85850 events.
\s1 Ongoing miracles and healings
\p
\v 12 The missionaries¦85857 went on to do many miracles and amazing things, and all the people¦85867 who gathered in Solomon's¦85881 Porch had a united vision,
\v 13 but¦85893 no one else dared to join them. However, the people¦85897 were talking positively about them
\v 14 and more were becoming believers¦85902 in the master¦85904—big numbers of both men and women¦85909.
\v 15 Some would even bring¦85916 those who were sick¦85918 out to the side of the road, lying them on beds and mats waiting for Peter to come past so that \add even\add* his shadow¦85933 might touch them.
\v 16 More crowds were coming¦85948 from the towns around Jerusalem¦85959, bringing¦85960 those who were sick¦85961 and those tormented¦85963 by demons¦85967, and they were all getting healed¦85970.
\s1 The preachers get arrested but released again
\p
\v 17 But the chief¦85977 priest¦85977 and his colleagues who were members of the sect of Sadducees¦85987 were filled¦85988 with jealousy¦85989 and took action
\v 18 by having the missionaries¦85999 arrested¦85992 and thrown into the public¦86005 jail¦86004.
\v 19 But one of the master's¦86016 angels¦86013 opened¦86022 the prison¦86028 doors¦86026 during the night¦86019 and¦86031 led them out again, saying,
\v 20 “Now go and stand in the temple¦86040 and keep telling the people¦86042 all the teaching about \add new\add* life¦86047.”
\v 21 So at dawn, having taken notice of the angel, they went into the temple¦86057 and started teaching¦86059 \add the people there again\add*.
\p When the chief¦86064 priest¦86064 arrived¦86060 with his companions, they called together¦86073 the \add religious\add* council and also the \add political\add* council of Israel, then called for the missionaries to be brought¦86089 in from the prison¦86088.
\v 22 But when their attendants¦86099 got to the jail, they weren't there, so they returned¦86107 to the gathering and told them,
\v 23 “We found the prison¦86116 all locked up with the guards¦86125 in their positions at the doors¦86131, but¦86133 when they opened¦86132 it up, there was no one inside¦86134!”
\v 24 When they¦86139 heard¦86139 this, the officer¦86148 of the temple¦86150 and¦86151 the chief¦86153 priests¦86153 were totally puzzled as to what could have happened.
\v 25 Just then someone¦86165 came in and¦86183 told them, “Hey, the men¦86172 that you¦86174 put in prison¦86177 are in the temple¦86181—standing there teaching¦86184 the people¦86186.”
\v 26 So the temple officer¦86190 took the attendants¦86193 and went and got them, but didn't use force¦86200 because¦86203 they were afraid that the people¦86205 might start throwing rocks at them.
\p
\v 27 So they¦86213 brought¦86210 them in and stood them in front of the council¦86216, where the chief¦86222 priest¦86222 addressed them,
\v 28 \x + \xo 5:28: \xt Mat 27:25.\x*“We officially commanded¦86226 you all not to be teaching in this name¦86233 and authority. But see¦86236 here, now you have filled¦86237 Jerusalem¦86240 with your¦86243 teaching, and what's more, you're blaming us for the death of that man¦86252.”
\v 29 But Peter and¦86259 the other missionaries¦86261 answered¦86255, “It's better to obey God¦86267 than people¦86270.
\v 30 The god¦86279 of our¦86282 ancestors¦86281 brought Yeshua¦86284 back to life after you¦86286 all handed¦86287 him¦86288 over to be hung up on a pole.
\v 31 But God¦86293 honoured this way-maker and saviour¦86296 by placing him¦86301 in the place of honour, to \add encourage\add* Israel to repent¦86304 and \add then\add* to forgive¦86308 their sins¦86309.
\v 32 We are witnesses¦86318 of these¦86323 messages¦86322, along with the pure¦86329 spirit¦86326 who God¦86334 gave¦86332 to the ones who obey him¦86337.”
\p
\v 33 When the gathered councils heard¦86340 this, they were enraged and wanted to kill¦86346 them,
\v 34 but a certain¦86350 member¦86357 of the Pharisee¦86357 party¦86357 named Gamaliel¦86359 stood up in the council¦86355 chamber. He was a law teacher¦86360 respected by all the community, and he ordered the \add guards\add* to take them outside¦86368 for a while,
\v 35 then he¦86376 said¦86376, “Fellow Israelis, think carefully about what you're planning to do with these¦86396 men¦86395.
\v 36 A while back, a man called Theudas¦86407 became¦86440 prominent, saying¦86408 that he was someone¦86410 important. Eventually about¦86423 four¦86425 hundred¦86425 others joined¦86417 him, but he was killed¦86428 and those who had followed him were dispersed¦86438 and it all came¦86440 to nothing¦86442.
\v 37 A bit later on, a Galilean¦86448 man named Judas became prominent at the time of the census and he attracted people¦86456 to him. But he also died, and all those who'd been persuaded¦86469 by him ended up being¦86469 scattered¦86471.
\v 38 So here's my advice to you¦86478 all: pull back from \add killing\add* these¦86483 men¦86482 and allow¦86485 them \add to continue\add*, because¦86492 if this teaching and goings on is man-made, it'll be overthrown,
\v 39 but if it's from God, you all won't be able to bring them down in case you find yourselves opposing God.”
\p So they were persuaded¦86534 by Gamaliel,
\v 40 and after calling¦86538 in the missionaries¦86540 and having them beaten, they commanded¦86542 them not to speak¦86546 using the name¦86550 and authority of Yeshua¦86552 and then sent¦86554 them out.
\v 41 So the missionaries left the councils¦86565, very excited that they were considered¦86567 worthy¦86567 to be disgraced because¦86568 of Yeshua.
\v 42 After that, they¦86587 never stopped teaching¦86588 and preaching¦86590 the good¦86590 message¦86590 about Yeshua¦86595 the messiah¦86594 in the temple¦86582 and in various homes.
\c 6
\s1 Seven administrators appointed
\p
\v 1 However around that time when the number of Yeshua-followers were growing, some of the Greek converts starting grumbling¦86607 about the Jewish believers because¦86613 the Greek widows¦86622 were being¦86614 overlooked¦86614 in the daily¦86620 sharing \add of food and money\add*.
\v 2 So the twelve¦86632 \add missionaries\add* assembled the believers together and told them, “We're not pleased¦86642 about having to take time off \add sharing\add* the message¦86649 of God¦86651 to be serving¦86652 here at the \add distribution\add* tables¦86653.
\v 3 So brothers¦86661, look around you¦86665 for seven¦86669 men¦86663 who're well known to be full of \add God's\add* spirit¦86671 and¦86673 wisdom¦86674, so we¦86676 can appoint¦86676 them to be in charge of this part of the work.
\v 4 Then we¦86683 \add ourselves\add* can continue to pray and¦86688 share the message¦86692.”
\p
\v 5 This idea pleased¦86696 the group, so they¦86708 went ahead and chose¦86708 Stephen (a man¦86712 full of faith¦86715 and of the pure¦86720 spirit¦86718), Philip, Procorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas¦86730, and Nicolas (a non-Jew from Antioch¦86735 who had previously converted¦86734 to Judaism).
\v 6 They stood¦86739 these seven up in front of the missionaries¦86744, who prayed¦86747 and¦86745 then placed their¦86750 hands¦86751 on them.
\p
\v 7 God's message¦86754 continued spreading and the number of followers¦86764 in Jerusalem¦86766 was rapidly increasing, and a large number of the priests¦86772 became believers.
\s1 Stephen gets arrested after teaching and doing miracles
\p
\v 8 Now Stephen \add (one of the seven)\add* was full of grace¦86783 and power and was doing¦86787 miracles and amazing demonstrations of God's power among¦86792 the people¦86794.
\v 9 But a group from the Freedmen¦86812 Synagogue as well as \add Jews\add* from Cyrene, Alexandria¦86816, Cilicia, and Asia rose up and started arguing against Stephen,
\v 10 but they weren't able to refute the wisdom¦86832 that he spoke \add with the help of\add* the pure spirit¦86839.
\v 11 So they¦86860 got some men¦86861 \add to falsely accuse Stephen\add* saying¦86862, “We heard¦86865 him¦86866 denigrating Moses and¦86874 God¦86876.”
\v 12 So they stirred¦86877 up the people¦86880 and the elders¦86883 and the law teachers¦86886 and so they approached¦86888 \add Stephen\add* and arrested him and brought¦86893 him to the council¦86897 \add chambers\add*.
\v 13 There they¦86899 produced the false¦86902 witnesses¦86901 saying¦86905, “This man¦86909 won't stop spreading messages¦86916 against this holy \add temple\add* and against the law
\v 14 because¦86928 we¦86927 heard¦86927 him¦86929 saying¦86930 that that Yeshua¦86932 from Nazareth¦86934 will be tearing¦86936 down this building and¦86940 will be changing¦86941 the traditions that Moses¦86948 gave¦86946 to us.”
\v 15 So then the council¦86963 members looked¦86950 across at Stephen and saw that his¦86969 face \add was shining\add* like that of an angel¦86972.
\c 7
\s1 Stephen's history discourse and accusations
\p
\v 1 Then the chief¦86980 priest¦86980 asked \add Stephen\add*, “Is all this true?”
\p
\v 2 \x + \xo 7:2-3: \xt Gen 12:1.\x*And he replied, “My brothers¦86994 and fathers¦86996, please listen. Our¦87005 honoured God¦86999 was seen¦87002 by our¦87005 ancestor Abraham¦87006 in Mesopotamia¦87010 before¦87011 he moved to Haran
\v 3 and he told him, ‘Leave your land and your relatives¦87030, and go to the place that I will show you.’

\v 7 \x + \xo 7:7: \xt Exo 3:12.\x*However God¦87152 promised to punish the nation¦87142 that enslaved them, and told him that in the end they would leave that place¦87164 and serve¦87146 him here in this country.

\v 9 \x + \xo 7:9: a \xt Gen 37:11; \xo b \xt Gen 37:28; \xo c \xt Gen 39:2,21.\x*Those brothers went on to become jealous¦87198 of Joseph¦87200 and sent him back into Egypt¦87203 \add as a slave\add*, but God¦87207 was with him
\v 10 \x + \xo 7:10: \xt Gen 41:39-41.\x*and rescued¦87211 him out of all his¦87218 troubles there. Then God gave¦87220 him wisdom¦87225 and caused him to gain the favour¦87222 of Pharaoh, the king¦87229 of Egypt, who then appointed¦87232 him as the ruler of all Egypt and over Pharaoh's own household¦87241.
\v 11 \x + \xo 7:11: \xt Gen 42:1-2.\x*Then a famine¦87246 hit all Egypt¦87254 and Canaan causing great¦87259 distress and our¦87267 ancestors¦87266 were unable to find enough food.
\v 12 But Jacob¦87271 heard¦87268 that grain¦87273 was available in Egypt¦87277, so first¦87286, he¦87281 sent¦87279 off our¦87285 tribal leaders.

\v 14 \x + \xo 7:14: a \xt Gen 45:9-10,17-18; \xo b \xt Gen 46:27 (LXX).\x*Then Joseph¦87311 sent¦87309 for his¦87316 father¦87315 Jacob¦87313 and¦87318 all the extended family—some seventy-five¦87325 of them.
\v 15 \x + \xo 7:15: a \xt Gen 46:1-7; \xo b \xt Gen 49:33.\x*So Jacob¦87332 went to Egypt¦87334, where he and the \add twelve\add* tribal leaders eventually died¦87336,

\p
\v 17 \x + \xo 7:17-18: \xt Exo 1:7-8.\x*But as the time¦87374 limit promised¦87379 to Abraham¦87384 by God¦87382 was getting closer, \add our\add* people¦87387 multiplied¦87389 in Egypt¦87391
\v 18 until¦87392 another¦87396 Pharaoh¦87398 ended up ruling there who had never known¦87402 Joseph¦87405.
\v 19 \x + \xo 7:19: a \xt Exo 1:10-11; \xo b \xt Exo 1:22.\x*He took advantage¦87409 of us Jews and mistreated¦87413 our¦87412 ancestors¦87415, even forcing them apart from their¦87423 own babies¦87421 so they wouldn't live¦87427.
\v 20 \x + \xo 7:20: \xt Exo 2:2.\x*Moses was born during that time¦87430 and¦87434 God¦87438 considered him beautiful¦87436. He spent three¦87442 months¦87441 in his \add own\add* father's¦87447 house¦87445
\v 21 \x + \xo 7:21: \xt Exo 2:3-10.\x*before being placed outside, from where Pharaoh's¦87463 daughter¦87462 took¦87458 him and brought¦87465 him up herself¦87468 as her own son.
\v 22 So Moses was instructed¦87472 in all the wisdom¦87478 of the Egyptians, and was a powerful¦87484 speaker and project leader.
\p
\v 23 \x + \xo 7:23-29: \xt Exo 2:11-15.\x*But when he hit forty¦87497, it entered his mind¦87502 to vist his relatives, the Israelis.
\v 24 When he noticed one of them being mistreated, he retaliated¦87519 and while defending the oppressed man, he struck¦87526 \add and killed\add* the Egyptian.
\v 25 He thought his¦87547 relatives would understand¦87538 that God¦87544 was bringing salvation¦87550 to them via him¦87547, but¦87554 they¦87552 didn't see it that way.
\v 26 So on the following¦87560 day¦87561 when he saw two of them quarrelling¦87564, he tried to resolve the situation by saying, ‘Men, you're all brothers¦87581. Why are you injuring¦87586 each other?’
\v 27 But the bullying one pushed¦87594 him¦87595 away and¦87602 said¦87596, ‘Who made you¦87599 the judge¦87603 over us?
\v 28 Do you want to kill¦87608 me like you killed¦87614 that Egyptian yesterday¦87615?’
\v 29 \x + \xo 7:29: \xt Exo 18:3-4.\x*When he heard that, Moses fled \add Egypt\add* and became¦87631 an exile in Midian where¦87636 he \add eventually\add* had two¦87639 sons¦87638.
\p
\v 30 \x + \xo 7:30-34: \xt Exo 3:1-10.\x*After another forty¦87648 years¦87646, he was in the wilderness¦87653 around Mount¦87655 Sinai when he saw an angel¦87658 in the flame¦87661 of a burning thorn¦87665 bush.
\v 31 Moses was amazed at the vision¦87673 when he saw it, so he approached¦87675 \add the bush\add* to look more closely when he heard the voice¦87681 of the master¦87683 saying,
\v 32 ‘I am the god of your¦87695 ancestors¦87694—the god of Abraham¦87698 and of Isaac¦87702 and of Jacob¦87706.’ At that point, Moses started trembling¦87707 and was scared to go any closer to look,
\v 33 but the master¦87726 said¦87718, ‘Take off your¦87735 sandals¦87730, because¦87737 the ground¦87746 you're standing on is dedicated to God.
\v 34 I have noticed the mistreatment¦87754 of my¦87757 people¦87756 in Egypt and heard¦87766 their¦87764 groaning¦87763 and so I came¦87769 down to rescue¦87770 them, so now I'm going to send¦87775 you¦87777 \add back\add* to Egypt.’
\p
\v 35 \x + \xo 7:35: \xt Exo 2:14.\x*This was the same Moses that they had previously rejected and asked who had made him ruler and judge¦87791 over them. Now God¦87796 had indeed sent him as ruler and liberator by means of the angel¦87808 that he saw in the thorn¦87814 bush.
\v 36 \x + \xo 7:36: a \xt Exo 7:3; \xo b \xt Exo 14:21; \xo c \xt Num 14:33.\x*So eventually Moses led them out of Egypt¦87826 after doing miracles and signs¦87822 of God's power there, and then also at the Red Sea and during the forty¦87837 years¦87836 in the wilderness¦87835.
\v 37 \x + \xo 7:37: \xt Deu 18:15,18.\x*This same Moses told Israelis that in the future God¦87853 would raise up another prophet¦87848 like him from among them.
\v 38 \x + \xo 7:38: \xt Exo 19:1–20:17; Deu 5:1-33.\x*Now Moses was the person that \add led\add* the assembly¦87872 \add of people\add* in the wilderness¦87875, was spoken to by an angel¦87878 on Mt.

\p
\v 39 “Yet our¦87908 ancestors¦87907 didn't want to obey that man, so they rejected him¦87910 and started thinking about Egypt¦87924 again,
\v 40 \x + \xo 7:40: \xt Exo 32:1.\x*saying to Aaron, ‘Make some gods¦87931 for us to lead us because¦87930 we've got no idea what happened to that Moses who led us out of Egypt¦87946.’
\v 41 \x + \xo 7:41: \xt Exo 32:2-6.\x*So together they made a calf as an idol¦87964 to bring sacrifices¦87962 to, and they were pleased with what they'd achieved.
\v 42 \x + \xo 7:42-43: \xt Amos 5:25-27 (LXX).\x*But God¦87977 turned¦87973 and allowed them to serve the heavenly¦87985 armies, just as the prophets¦87991 wrote,
\q1 ‘It wasn't me that you Israelis sacrificed¦87995 to for those forty¦87999 years¦87998 in the wilderness¦88002.
\q1
\v 43 You turned to Molech's tent and Rephan's star¦88017 as your¦88020 gods by making images¦88024 of them to bow down to. So for that, I'll send you all away into exile beyond¦88036 Babylon¦88037.’
\p
\v 44 \x + \xo 7:44: \xt Exo 25:9,40.\x*The tent of evidence was with our¦88047 ancestors¦88045 in the wilderness¦88050—made to the pattern¦88064 that God had shown Moses.
\v 45 \x + \xo 7:45: \xt Josh 3:14-17.\x*Our¦88074 ancestors¦88073 then carried that tent into the land, having¦88071 inherited¦88071 it along with Joshua from the possession¦88080 of the pagans which¦88068 God¦88087 drove¦88084 out ahead of them. The tent remained there until¦88094 the time of David¦88097
\v 46 \x + \xo 7:46: \xt 2Sam 7:1-16; 1Ch 17:1-14.\x*who found¦88099 favour¦88100 with God¦88103 and¦88104 requested¦88105 to find a tent for the house¦88110 of Jacob¦88112,
\v 47 \x + \xo 7:47: \xt 1Ki 6:1-38; 2Ch 3:1-17.\x*but it was Solomon¦88113 who built¦88117 the house¦88120 for God¦88119 \add to reside in\add*.
\p
\v 48 However the highest¦88125 one doesn't actually live in structures made by people, but as the prophet¦88135 wrote,

\v 50 Wasn't it me that created everything?’
\p
\v 51 \x + \xo 7:51: \xt Isa 63:10.\x*You stiff-necked people with uncircumcised¦88175 hearts¦88180 and ears¦88184! You're always¦88186 opposing¦88191 the pure¦88190 spirit¦88188 just like your¦88196 ancestors¦88195 were.
\v 52 Which¦88200 one of the prophets¦88202 wasn't persecuted¦88204 by your¦88208 ancestors¦88207? Even the ones that foretold¦88213 the coming of the righteous¦88219 one were killed¦88210 off by them in just the same way that you yourselves became¦88227 his betrayers¦88223 and murderers¦88225!
\v 53 You had received¦88229 the law under the direction of angels¦88234, and¦88235 yet you didn't obey it¦88237.”
\s1 Stephen's lynching and death
\p
\v 54 When they heard that, they were raging inside and grating¦88249 their¦88251 teeth¦88252 at him¦88254.
\v 55 But being¦88255 full of the pure¦88261 spirit¦88260, Stephen stared up into the sky and was able to see God's splendor, as well as seing Yeshua¦88270 standing there on God's right¦88275.
\v 56 He said¦88281, “I can look through the sky that's opened¦88286 up and can see humankind's child standing at God's right¦88295 side.”
\p
\v 57 At this point, they blocked their¦88306 ears¦88305 and rushed¦88308 together to grab Stephen, yelling loudly¦88302.
\v 58 They drove him out of the city¦88317 and then started throwing¦88313 rocks at him. His accusers left their¦88327 cloaks in charge of a young¦88332 man¦88332 named¦88334 Saul.
\v 59 As Stephen was being hit by the rocks, he¦88349 called out, “Master¦88344 Yeshua¦88346, receive¦88348 my¦88351 spirit¦88350.”
\v 60 Then falling to his knees¦88355, just before he died he called out loudly¦88359, “Master¦88362, don't¦88363 hold this sin¦88370 against them.”
\c 8
\p
\v 1 (And Saul¦88377 was agreeing that Stephen should be executed.)
\s1 Persecution of believers intensifies
\p That same day¦88389, intense persecution¦88390 began against¦88395 the assembly¦88397 in Jerusalem¦88400, and so the believers fled throughout¦88405 the regions¦88407 of Judea¦88409 and Samaria¦88411, except¦88412 for the twelve who stayed.
\v 2 (Some godly¦88425 men¦88424 buried¦88419 Stephen with loud wailing.)
\p
\v 3 \x + \xo 8:3: \xt Acts 22:4-5; 26:9-11.\x*As for Saul¦88434, he started on destroying the assembly¦88439 by entering¦88443 people's homes and dragging¦88444 both men and women¦88449 out and then off to prison¦88453.
\s1 Philip preaches in Samaria
\p
\v 4 However, now the people who had fled began to proclaim the good message to others in other places.
\v 5 Around the same time, Philip went to a city¦88468 in Samaria¦88471 and¦88464 told them about the messiah¦88475.
\v 6 Crowds gathered and listened carefully to Philip and watched him do miracles—
\v 7 many demon-possessed¦88512 people shouted¦88513 loudly¦88516 as the demons¦88512 left them, and many who were paralysed¦88521 or lame were healed¦88524
\v 8 so there were a lot of happy people there.
\s1 Simon the magician seeks power
\p
\v 9 One man¦88538 in the city¦88547 had been practicing¦88548 magic¦88548 and amazing¦88550 the people¦88554, and he claimed that he was someone¦88559 great¦88561. His name¦88541 was Simon¦88542
\v 10 and the people there from the least to the most important said, “This power is from the great god¦88576.”
\v 11 They gave him¦88582 a lot of attention because¦88583 he'd been amazing them with magic¦88588 for quite a long time¦88586.
\v 12 However when Philip started preaching¦88598 the good message about God's kingdom¦88603 and the name and authority of Yeshua¦88611 the messiah¦88612, they believed¦88593 the message, and many men and women¦88617 asked to be immersed¦88613 \add in water\add*.
\v 13 Simon¦88620 himself¦88622 also believed¦88623 and was immersed¦88625, and then started accompanying Philip around—marvelling¦88642 as he¦88642 observed¦88631 the miracles¦88637 and signs¦88635 of God's power.
\p
\v 14 When the missionaries¦88650 in Jerusalem¦88648 heard¦88644 that many people from Samaria¦88654 had accepted God's message¦88656, they¦88660 sent¦88660 Peter and¦88665 John¦88666 out to them
\v 15 so then they prayed¦88669 for them to receive¦88673 the pure¦88675 spirit¦88674.
\v 16 (The pure spirit hadn't fallen¦88684 on any of them at that point, but¦88686 they¦88688 had only been immersed¦88687 into the name¦88691 and authority of the master¦88694 Yeshua¦88695.)
\v 17 So Peter and John placed their¦88701 hands¦88702 on the new believers and they received¦88706 the pure¦88708 spirit¦88707.
\p
\v 18 When Simon¦88713 the magician saw that they received the spirit¦88724 after having¦88709 the hands¦88719 of the missionaries¦88721 placed on them, he offered¦88727 money¦88730 to Peter and John, saying,
\v 19 “Give me this authority¦88737 so that whoever I place \em my\em* hands¦88746 on will receive¦88747 the pure¦88749 spirit¦88748.”
\p
\v 20 But Peter responded, “May your money¦88773 join you in your destruction¦88764 because¦88765 you thought¦88770 you could buy God's gift¦88767 with it¦88762.
\v 21 There's no role for you here and no part for you in our work because your¦88789 heart¦88788 isn't right¦88792 with God¦88797.
\v 22 You need to turn away from this evil¦88802 \add desire\add* and beg the master¦88809 that maybe he'll forgive¦88813 you for your¦88804 wrong intentions¦88817
\v 23 because I perceive that you¦88833 have a bitter¦88825 attitude and and ungodly habits.
\p
\v 24 Simon¦88838 answered¦88835, “Oh, please ask the master¦88852 on my behalf that none of what you¦88866 mentioned will happen to me.”
\s1 Philip immerses the Ethiopian official
\p
\v 25 After that, Peter and John continued to testify¦88876 and proclaim the good message¦88881 about the master¦88884 in many villages¦88893 around Samaria¦88895 before they returned¦88886 to Jerusalem¦88889.
\p
\v 26 Then an angel¦88898 from the master¦88900 spoke¦88901 to Philip, “Start walking and head south¦88911 on the road that goes downhill from Jerusalem¦88919 to Gaza through the wilderness¦88924.”
\v 27 So he headed off, and \add on the road\add* he came across an important official¦88933 of the Ethiopian queen\f + \fr 8:27 \ft Some translations list the queen's name as ‘Candace’, but that was the name of the series of queens, cf., Pharaoh or Caesar which came to be used as a title for more than one person.\f* who was in charge of her¦88945 treasury¦88944. This man¦88930 had been in Jerusalem¦88951 to worship God
\v 28 and was returning¦88956 home in his¦88962 chariot¦88961. As he rode, he was reading¦88964 \add the scroll of\add* the prophet¦88970 Isaiah,
\v 29 and the spirit¦88975 told Philip to approach him and stay by the chariot¦88982.
\v 30 So Philip ran up to the chariot and heard¦88989 the man reading from the prophet¦88994 Isaiah and asked, “Do you know what it is that you're¦89002 reading about?”
\p
\v 31 “How could I know when I don't¦89014 have someone¦89015 to guide me,” he answered, and so he invited Philip to climb up and sit¦89025 with him.
\v 32 Now the particular passage¦89030 that he was reading¦89034 was this:\x + \xo 8:32-33: \xt Isa 53:7-8 (LXX).\x*
\q1 ‘He was led away like a sheep¦89039 being led to the slaughterhouse¦89041,
\q1 and stayed as silent¦89053 as a lamb being shorn
\q2 so he never opened his¦89059 mouth¦89058.
\q1
\v 33 He was humiliated¦89062 by a lack of justice¦89065.
\q1 Who can name his descendants,
\q2 because his life¦89080 is being¦89075 taken from the earth¦89078?’
\p
\v 34 “Now tell me,” said¦89088 the official, “who was Isaiah talking about? Was he talking about himself¦89098 or someone¦89102 else?”
\v 35 So Philip started with that passage and explained the good¦89117 message¦89117 about Yeshua¦89120 to him.
\v 36 As they were going¦89123 along¦89124 the road¦89126, they came to some water, and the official asked, “Look, here's some water. What would stop me from being immersed¦89140 here?”
\p
\v 37 ≈
\v 38 So he commanded¦89165 \add the driver\add* to stop the chariot¦89168 and they both climbed down, and Philip immersed¦89182 the official in the water¦89174.
\v 39 But as they came out of the water¦89189, the master's¦89198 spirit¦89190 snatched¦89199 Philip away and so the official never saw¦89204 him again, but he continued on his¦89214 journey very happy.
\v 40 As for Philip, he found¦89218 himself at \add the town of\add* Azotus, and as he passed through¦89222 \add the coastal towns\add* on the way to Caesarea¦89234, he proclaimed the good¦89223 message¦89223 in each town.

\s1 Yeshua talks to Saul
\r (Acts 22:6-16; 26:12-18)
\p
\v 1 Meanwhile Saul was still¦89239 spouting off murderous¦89243 threats¦89241 towards¦89244 the followers¦89246 of the master¦89248. He went to the chief¦89251 priest¦89251
\v 2 and obtained \add official\add* letters¦89256 to enable him to enter the Jewish¦89262 meeting¦89262 halls¦89262 in Damascus¦89258 so that if he found either male or female followers of Yeshua, he could arrest them and bring¦89277 them to Jerusalem¦89279 in chains.
\p
\v 3 On his journey as he approached Damascus¦89288, suddenly¦89290 light¦89295 from the sky¦89300 flashed¦89294 around¦89294 him.
\v 4 He dropped to his knees\f + \fr 9:4 \ft It seems most likely that Paul and company were walking to Damascus (and not on horseback despite paintings by Caravaggio and others). The journey of somewhere around 300km would have taken around two weeks.\f* and heard¦89306 a voice¦89307 calling, “Saul, Saul, why are you¦89314 persecuting¦89314 me?”
\p
\v 5 “Who are you, master¦89320?” he¦89315 asked.
\p And the voice replied, “I'm Yeshua¦89327, the one that you're¦89331 persecuting¦89332.
\v 6 Now, stand up and go into the city¦89360, and you'll be told there what you need to do.”
\p
\v 7 Meanwhile his travelling¦89373 companions had stood¦89375 there speechless¦89376, because they had heard the voice¦89380 but couldn't see anyone.
\v 8 They helped Saul¦89388 up from the ground¦89391, but even when he opened¦89392 his¦89399 eyes¦89398, he couldn't see anything. So they had to lead him into Damascus¦89408 by hand¦89403.
\v 9 Saul stayed there for three¦89412 days¦89411, unable to see and¦89415 not eating or drinking anything.
\s1 Ananias restores Saul's sight
\p
\v 10 Now there was a believer there in Damascus¦89427 named Ananias, and the master spoke to him in a vision¦89437, calling, “Ananias.”
\p “I'm here, master,” he answered.
\p
\v 11 So the master¦89449 told him¦89451, “Get up and¦89461 go to Judas' house¦89464 in Straight¦89460 Street where you'll find a man named Saul from Tarsus¦89468. He's praying¦89471 right now
\v 12 and in his vision¦89476, he saw¦89473 a man¦89474 named Ananias¦89479 who comes in and places his hands¦89487 on him so that he can receive¦89489 his sight¦89489 back.”
\p
\v 13 But Ananias¦89493 resisted, “Master¦89494, I've heard¦89496 a lot about that man¦89501, including all the evil¦89504 things he's done to your¦89508 dedicated people in Jerusalem¦89511,
\v 14 and¦89513 the reason he's here in Damascus with the authority¦89516 of the chief¦89519 priests¦89519 is to arrest everyone who trusts in you¦89526.”
\p
\v 15 But the master¦89532 said¦89527, “Go now, because¦89534 I have chosen that man¦89540 to be a bearer of my¦89545 name¦89544 and authority both in other countries, even to their kings¦89551, and to the descendants of Israel,
\v 16 because¦89556 I'll be showing¦89557 him what he's going to have to suffer¦89566 for bearing my¦89565 name¦89564.”
\p
\v 17 So Ananias¦89570 left and went¦89567 into Judas' house¦89575 where he placed his hands¦89581 on Saul and said¦89584, “Brother Saul, the master¦89588 has sent¦89589 me here—Yeshua¦89591 the one you saw on the road¦89597 when you were coming¦89599 here—so that you will be able to see again and also be filled¦89604 with the pure¦89606 spirit¦89605.”
\v 18 Immediately something¦89609 like scales¦89618 fell off Saul's¦89611 eyes¦89614 and he was able to see again, and he got up¦89625 and got immersed¦89627 in water,
\v 19 before getting something to eat to renew his strength¦89632.
\s1 Saul starts preaching in Damascus¦89640
\p Then Saul stayed several days¦89642 with the believers in Damascus.
\v 20 He went straight into the Jewish¦89649 meeting¦89649 halls¦89649 and started proclaiming¦89650 that Yeshua¦89652 is God's son.
\p
\v 21 The hearers were all amazed¦89661, saying¦89669, “Isn't this the guy that persecuted¦89674 the ones following that Yeshua in Jerusalem¦89677, and even came to Damascus to arrest them here and take them back to the chief¦89697 priests¦89697?”
\p
\v 22 But Saul was growing stronger\f + \fr 9:22 \ft It's not clear here whether it means that Saul was growing physically stronger, or that his preaching and debating skills were improving.\f* and he was confounding¦89705 the Jews¦89708 living¦89710 in Damascus¦89712 as he taught¦89713 them that Yeshua is the \add promised\add* messiah¦89718.
\p
\v 23 \x + \xo 9:23-25: \xt 2Cor 11:32-33.\x*After several days¦89722, the religious Jews¦89726 plotted¦89724 together¦89724 to kill¦89727 him¦89728,
\v 24 but Saul¦89732 found out about their¦89736 plan. Those Jews were also watching¦89738 the city exits so they could kill¦89753 him if he tried leaving,
\v 25 but his¦89759 supporters took him to the city wall at night¦89760 time and lowered¦89768 him down in a basket¦89770.
\s1 Saul goes to Jerusalem but has to leave
\p
\v 26 When he got back to Jerusalem¦89778, Saul attempted¦89780 to join in with the believers there but they were all scared of him, not believing¦89790 that he was a true follower¦89793 of Yeshua.
\v 27 However Barnabas¦89794 took Saul and brought¦89798 him to the twelve, and Saul told them how he had seen the master¦89811 on the road¦89808, and been spoken to by him, and how he had spoken boldy in Damascus¦89819 in the name¦89823 and authority of Yeshua¦89825.
\v 28 So Saul stayed connected with the believers, going¦89833 in and out of Jerusalem¦89836 and speaking¦89839 boldly¦89839 in the name¦89842 and authority of the master¦89844.
\v 29 He also talked and¦89848 debated¦89849 with the Greek-speaking Jews, but¦89856 they¦89855 wanted to kill¦89859 him¦89860,
\v 30 so when the brothers¦89865 found out, they took Saul down to Caesarea¦89870 \add on the coast\add*, and from there sent¦89872 him \add on a ship\add* to Tarsus¦89876.
\p
\v 31 After that the assembly¦89882 of believers throughout Judea¦89886 and Galilee¦89888 and Samaria¦89890 had peace¦89893 and grew in their respect and service of the master¦89903, also well as increasing in numbers through the encouragement of the pure¦89908 spirit¦89909.
\s1 Peter heals Aeneas
\p
\v 32 Peter¦89914 travelled around the country and then went to visit the dedicated believers in Lydda¦89926.
\v 33 He saw a paralysed¦89945 man¦89931 named Aeneas who'd spent eight¦89938 years¦89937 lying¦89939 on his pallet¦89942,
\v 34 and said¦89947 to him¦89948, “Aeneas, Yeshua¦89956 the messiah¦89958 is healing¦89952 you¦89953. Stand up and pack up your bed.” And straight away Aeneas stood up
\v 35 and all the people living¦89973 in Lydda¦89974 and Sharon¦89978 who saw¦89967 him¦89970 became¦89982 followers¦89982 of the master¦89985.
\s1 Peter brings Tabitha back to life
\p
\v 36 Then in Joppa¦89987 there was a believer named Tabitha¦89993 (or Dorcas if translated) and¦90004 she¦90007 did a lot of good¦90003 things as well as being generous to the poor.
\v 37 Around that time she¦90015 got sick and died. After washing her¦90019 body, they¦90020 placed it¦90008 in an upper¦90024 room,
\v 38 and since Joppa¦90032 was near Lydda¦90028 and the believers had heard¦90035 that Peter was there, they¦90041 quickly sent¦90041 two¦90042 men¦90043 to request, “Please come as soon as possible.”
\v 39 So Peter went with them, and when they arrived¦90061 in Joppa they took him up to the room. All the widows¦90073 stood¦90069 there, sobbing and showing¦90076 him various clothes¦90079 that Tabitha had made for them.
\v 40 But Peter had them all removed from the room, and then kneeling down he prayed¦90106 before turning back to the body¦90111 and said¦90112, “Tabitha¦90113, get up.” Then she opened¦90117 her¦90120 eyes¦90119, and seeing Peter there she sat¦90125 up.
\v 41 Peter helped her to stand up, then he called¦90134 the believers and the widows¦90140, and presented¦90144 the live Tabitha to them.
\v 42 News of this spread throughout¦90150 Joppa¦90153 and¦90154 many people there believed¦90156 in the master¦90160.
\v 43 So Peter stayed on there for quite a few days¦90164, living with a tanner¦90174 of hides named Simon¦90173.
\c 10
\s1 Peter and Cornelius each hear from God
\p
\v 1 Just up in Caesarea¦90180 there was a Roman army commander named Cornelius (leader of the ‘Italian¦90190 Regiment’)
\v 2 who, along with all his household¦90199, worshipped God and obeyed his laws. He gave to the poor and regularly asked God for help.
\v 3 One afternoon around 3pm he had a vision¦90215 where he clearly¦90216 saw¦90213 an angel¦90224 of God¦90226 come¦90227 into the house and spoke, “Cornelius.”
\p
\v 4 Cornelius was scared and looked¦90236 intently¦90236 and asked, “What is it, master¦90244?”
\p “Your¦90250 prayers¦90249 and your¦90250 helping the poor rose up to God's notice and attention,” he said.
\v 5 “Now, send some messengers to Joppa¦90267 to go and find a man there named Simon¦90271 Peter.
\v 6 He's staying with Simon¦90283 the tanner¦90285 whose¦90286 house¦90289 is by the sea¦90291.”
\v 7 So as soon as the angel¦90303 left, Cornelius called¦90309 two¦90310 of his house¦90312 servants¦90312 and¦90314 a godly¦90316 soldier¦90315 from his bodyguard,
\v 8 and¦90320 after explaining¦90321 the task to them, he¦90327 sent¦90327 them off to Joppa¦90331.
\p
\v 9 The next day¦90332 as they were approaching the town, Peter went¦90342 up onto the flat roof of the house¦90346 around midday to pray.
\v 10 But he felt hungry¦90355 and wanted something to eat, but while it was still being prepared¦90359 he fell into a trance¦90369
\v 11 and saw the sky open up. Something like a sheet¦90382 was being¦90390 lowered down to the earth¦90393 by the four¦90384 corners¦90385
\v 12 and it held all kinds of animals and reptiles¦90407, as well as birds¦90412.
\v 13 Then he heard a voice¦90417 saying, “Get up Peter, and slaughter these and eat¦90424 them.”
\p
\v 14 “I can't, master¦90430,” Peter responded, “because¦90431 I've never¦90432 eaten anything that's forbidden.”
\p
\v 15 But the voice¦90440 spoke a second¦90445 time¦90445, “Don't you¦90452 be treating anything as unclean that God¦90450 has made clean¦90451.”
\v 16 This vision happened three¦90460 times¦90460 and¦90461 then the sheet thing was lifted back up into the sky.
\p
\v 17 Now Peter was still there wondering what the vision¦90485 was all about when the men¦90491 sent¦90493 by Cornelius had tracked down the tanner's house¦90501 and arrived outside.
\v 18 They called out to ask if Simon¦90513 Peter was staying there.
\p
\v 19 Even as Peter still continued to ponder¦90523 about¦90524 the vision¦90526, the spirit¦90531 said¦90527, “Hey, there's three¦90536 men¦90534 here looking¦90537 for¦90537 you¦90539.
\v 20 So get up and¦90544 go downstairs to them. Believe everything they say because¦90552 I sent¦90555 them here.”
\v 21 So he went down and asked the men¦90565, “I'm the one you're looking¦90578 for, so tell me what you came here for.”
\p
\v 22 They answered, “We were sent by Cornelius who's an army commander who worships God¦90602 and obeys his laws and has a good reputation with you Jewish people. A holy angel¦90614 told him¦90621 to send¦90616 for you to come to his house¦90620 so they can listen to what you have to say.”
\v 23 So Peter invited them in to stay the night.
\p The next day¦90636, Peter and¦90645 some of the believers¦90648 from Joppa¦90652 started out with them
\v 24 and they arrived in Caesarea¦90666 the following day¦90658. Cornelius was expecting¦90672 them and had also invited some relatives¦90677 and close¦90682 friends¦90683 to join them.
\v 25 Peter entered the house and when they met, Cornelius knelt down and worshipped him
\v 26 but Peter pulled him¦90727 up and said, “Stand up. I'm just a man¦90737 like you.”
\v 27 After greeting each other, Peter went into the main room and¦90749 found that quite a few people had gathered there.
\v 28 Then he¦90754 told them, “You all know that us Jews¦90766 are forbidden by our laws to associate with or to enter the house of a non-Jew. However, God¦90779 showed¦90781 me that it's not right to treat other¦90772 people as being¦90768 lesser or undesirable.
\v 29 That's why I came¦90791 without any reservations when you sent for me. But I'm still waiting to know what you all want from me?”
\p
\v 30 So Cornelius answered, “I was praying¦90826 in my¦90830 house¦90829 three days ago in the middle of the afternoon when I suddenly saw a man¦90833 in shining¦90840 clothes¦90839 standing in front of me
\v 31 and he said, ‘Your¦90846 prayer¦90849 has been heard, Cornelius¦90843, and God¦90860 has noticed your¦90846 gifts to the poor.
\v 32 Now he wants you to send¦90861 messengers to get Simon, the one called¦90869 Peter, from Joppa¦90864 where he's living by the sea¦90883 in Simon the tanner's¦90879 house¦90875.’
\v 33 I did that straight away and you kindly came here, so now we're all here in God's \add sight\add* to find out everything that the master¦90929 has commanded¦90923 you to say.”
\s1 Peter's talk in Caesarea
\p
\v 34 So Peter spoke up and said¦90938, “Honestly, I'm still just realising that God¦90948 doesn't favour¦90946 only certain people\x + \xo 10:34: \xt Deu 10:17.\x*,
\v 35 but he¦90953 accepts¦90959 people from any nation¦90952 as long as they honour and obey him.
\v 36 He sent us a message through the descendants of Israel—a good message that teaches that we can have peace¦90973 through Yeshua¦90975 the messiah¦90976—everyone's master¦90980.
\v 37 And you all know the news that started in Galilee¦90996 and spread through¦90987 all Judea¦90990 after¦90997 the time of John's teaching and ministry of immersion¦90999—
\v 38 how God filled Yeshua¦91003 from Nazareth¦91006 with the pure¦91014 spirit¦91013 and with power¦91017, and who then went around doing¦91023 good¦91023 and heaing all those oppressed¦91028 by the devil¦91032, because¦91033 God was with him.
\v 39 We are witnesses¦91044 of all the things¦91046 he did in the Jewish provinces and in Jerusalem¦91057, and then how he was executed by them on a stake¦91064.
\v 40 Then God¦91067 brought him back to life on the third¦91073 day¦91075 and sent him where he¦91071 could be seen,
\v 41 not by all the people¦91086, but to the witnesses¦91088 that God¦91094 had previously¦91090 appointed¦91090—to us who ate¦91097 with him and drank¦91100 with him after¦91104 he'd been raised from the dead¦91109.
\v 42 He commanded¦91114 us to tell the people¦91118, and to testify¦91120 that he is the one who God¦91129 has designated¦91126 to be the judge¦91130 of the living¦91131 and the dead¦91133.
\v 43 \add The writings of\add* all the prophets¦91137 point towards him, and everyone¦91146 who believes¦91148 \add that he's God\add* can have their sins¦91140 forgiven¦91139 by his¦91145 authority.”
\s1 God's spirit enters non-Jews
\p
\v 44 While Peter was still¦91151 speaking¦91152, the pure¦91163 spirit¦91161 came down onto everyone who was listening.
\v 45 The Jewish believers¦91175 who had come with Peter were astonished that the gift¦91188 of the pure¦91190 spirit¦91191 had been poured¦91194 out even on non-Jews¦91186
\v 46 as they¦91195 heard them speaking¦91198 in other languages¦91199 and¦91200 magnifying¦91201 God¦91203. Then Peter said,
\v 47 “Surely¦91210 no one could argue against them getting immersed¦91220 in water¦91212 now that they've received¦91228 the pure¦91227 spirit¦91225 just like we¦91233 did?”
\v 48 So with the authority of Yeshua¦91246 the messiah¦91247, he¦91242 commanded¦91235 for them to be immersed¦91248 \add in water\add*. Then they¦91251 asked¦91251 him¦91252 to stay with them for a few more days¦91257.
\c 11
\s1 Peter explains everything to those in Jerusalem
\p
\v 1 Soon the missionaries¦91265 and¦91267 other believers¦91270 in Judea¦91278 heard¦91260 that non-Jews¦91283 had also accepted God's message¦91287,
\v 2 but when Peter went¦91296 to Jerusalem¦91304, the strict Jewish believers were upset with him¦91339,
\v 3 saying¦91343 that he had gone into the home of uncircumcised¦91349 pagans and¦91352 \add even\add* eaten with them.
\p
\v 4 But Peter started explaining¦91361 from the beginning,
\v 5 “I was staying in Joppa¦91370, and as I was praying¦91372 I saw¦91374 a vision¦91377 of an object¦91380 like a linen¦91383 sheet¦91383 coming¦91378 down, as if it was being¦91388 let down out of the sky by its four¦91385 corners¦91387. As it came¦91394 down to me
\v 6 I looked¦91400 at it and saw¦91403 animals, even wild animals, and reptiles¦91413 and birds¦91416.
\v 7 I also heard¦91420 a voice¦91423 telling me, ‘Peter, get up and slaughter these and eat¦91433 them.’
\v 8 But I said¦91434, ‘Master¦91438, I can't because¦91439 I've never¦91445 eaten anything that's forbidden.’
\v 9 But the voice¦91455 from the sky spoke again, ‘Don't you¦91468 be treating anything as unclean that God¦91466 has made clean¦91467.’
\v 10 This happened three¦91475 times¦91475, and¦91476 then it was pulled¦91478 up again¦91479 into the sky.
\v 11 Next minute there were three¦91487 men¦91488 at the house¦91493 where I was staying \add saying\add* that they had been sent¦91498 from Caesarea¦91500 to fetch me,
\v 12 and the spirit¦91508 told me to go with them without questioning anything they said. These six¦91522 other believers¦91523 went with me, and we¦91526 arrived at the house¦91529 of the man¦91531.
\v 13 He told us how he'd seen an angel¦91539 standing there in his¦91543 house¦91542 and who'd told him¦91543, ‘Send messengers to Joppa¦91551 to fetch Simon¦91555, the one called¦91557 Peter,
\v 14 and he¦91571 will explain to you how you and all your¦91573 household¦91572 can be saved¦91567.’
\v 15 Then when I started speaking¦91579 to them, the pure¦91586 spirit¦91584 came down on then just like it¦91584 had happened to us previously.
\v 16 That reminded¦91597 me of the words of the master¦91603 when he told us, ‘John¦91606 submerged people using water¦91609, but you all will be submerged by the pure¦91616 spirit¦91614.
\v 17 Therefore¦91618 if God gave¦91622 the same¦91620 gift¦91621 to them that he'd given to us when we'd believed¦91630 in the master¦91633 Yeshua¦91634 the messiah¦91635, what authority did I have to contradict God?’ ”
\p
\v 18 When the group heard¦91653 all this, they had no objections and they praised God, saying¦91663, “It seems that God has also allowed the pagans¦91668 to repent¦91672 and live.”
\s1 Many in Antioch become believers
\p
\v 19 Over time, due to the persecution that began with Stephen's killing, the ones who had moved away went as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch¦91697, but they only shared Yeshua's teaching with other Jews¦91707.
\v 20 However, some of the believers were from Cyprus and Cyrene, and when they got to Antioch¦91722 they proclaimed the good¦91730 news from the master¦91732 Yeshua¦91733 to the Greeks.
\v 21 And the master caused their efforts to prosper, so a large number¦91744 of Greeks believed¦91746 and decided to follow the master.
\p
\v 22 News about this reached the assembly¦91759 in Jerusalem¦91763, so they¦91768 sent¦91768 Barnabas¦91769 to Antioch¦91773.
\v 23 When he arrived¦91776 and saw how God's grace¦91780 \add was spreading\add*, he was elated¦91784 and encouraged them all to earnestly continue to follow the master¦91795.
\v 24 Barnabas was good¦91800 man¦91798 and full of the pure¦91804 spirit¦91803 and full of faith¦91806 \add in God\add*, and a large¦91810 number of people decided to follow Yeshua.
\p
\v 25 So Barnabas went to Tarsus¦91820 to look for Saul,
\v 26 and when he found¦91832 him, he brought¦91835 him back to Antioch. Then for a whole¦91849 year¦91848 they met with the assembly¦91854 and \add regularly\add* taught a large¦91859 crowd¦91858. It was there in Antioch that the believers were first¦91864 called Christians.
\p
\v 27 In those days¦91884, some prophets¦91888 from Jerusalem¦91887 went to Antioch¦91890,
\v 28 and one of them named Agabus when he was prompted by the spirit¦91911, stood¦91899 up and predicted that the world¦91921 would experience a severe famine¦91912 (and this happened \add later\add* during¦91926 the reign of Claudius).
\v 29 The believers decided to send¦91945 assistance to their¦91942 fellow¦91951 believers who lived in Judea¦91950—each one according to his means—
\v 30 and so they¦91956 did, sending their contributions with Barnabus¦91963 and Saul¦91965 to take to the elders¦91960.
\c 12
\s1 Persecution of believers restarts
\p
\v 1 Around that time¦91971, King Herod¦91975 \add Agrippa\add* used his power to mistreat¦91981 some of the believers from the assembly¦91986,
\v 2 and he had Jacob¦91993, the brother¦91995 of John¦91996, executed using a sword¦91998.
\v 3 Then when he saw that it pleased¦92003 the Jewish religious leaders, he went on to seize Peter during the Feast of Flat Bread.
\v 4 After being arrested¦92026, Peter was put in prison¦92030 where he was guarded¦92037 by four squads¦92035 of four soldiers¦92036 each. After the Passover Feast, Herod planned to display Peter to the people¦92047.
\v 5 But¦92051 while he was being¦92052 held in prison¦92055, those in the assembly¦92071 were earnestly¦92063 asking God¦92074 to help him.
\s1 An angel leads Peter out of prison
\p
\v 6 Herod¦92089 planned to send for Peter later that evening, but meanwhile Peter had fallen¦92096 asleep¦92096 chained with two chains between¦92097 two soldiers¦92099. There were also prison¦92114 guards¦92103 at the door¦92110
\v 7 but an angel of the master¦92118 \add suddenly appeared\add* standing by Peter and light¦92123 radiated through the prison¦92128 cell. The angel poked Peter in the side to wake him up, saying¦92138, “Quickly, get up!” The chains¦92147 fell off his¦92145 wrists
\v 8 and the angel said, “Get dressed and put on your sandals¦92165,” so he did. Then the angel said, “Now put on your coat and follow¦92178 me.”
\v 9 So Peter followed¦92182 the angel¦92195 out of the cell, not really knowing¦92186 if it was real or he was still dreaming.
\v 10 They went past the first¦92203 guard¦92204 and then the second¦92206, and then came to the iron gate which¦92220 led out of the prison into the city¦92219. The gate opened¦92222 by itself and they went out onto the street, then at the end of the street the angel¦92241 suddenly left him.
\p
\v 11 By now Peter was fully awake and said¦92252 to himself¦92250, “Now I know that the master¦92260 really did send his¦92263 angel¦92262 to rescue¦92265 me from Herod¦92270 and from the plans of the Jewish leaders.”
\p
\v 12 Now that he realised this, he went to Maria's¦92288 house¦92286 (the mother¦92290 of John¦92291 Mark) where¦92296 many believers had met to pray.
\v 13 He knocked¦92302 at the door¦92309 in the fence and a servant¦92314 girl¦92314 named Rhoda came out to see who it was.
\v 14 But when she recognised¦92321 Peter's voice¦92323, she was so excited that she forgot about opening the door, but ran back inside to tell everyone that Peter was standing out there.
\v 15 They told her that she must be raving¦92353 mad, but she insisted¦92356 it was true, but they said¦92351 that it must be his¦92370 angel¦92367.
\p
\v 16 Meanwhile Peter continued¦92374 knocking¦92375, and when they eventually opened¦92377 the outer door they saw¦92380 that it¦92377 was him¦92383 and they were amazed.
\v 17 But Peter signalled them with his hand¦92392 to be quiet, and then he explained how the master¦92404 had led him out of the prison¦92409, and instructed them, “Tell this to Jacob¦92414 and the brothers¦92417.” Then he left and went off to another¦92423 place¦92424.
\p
\v 18 Once daylight came¦92439, there¦92428 was pandemonium among¦92432 the soldiers¦92434 \add in the prison as they tried to figure out\add* what had happened to Peter.
\v 19 Then when King Herod sent for Peter and he wasn't there, the prison guarded¦92450 were interrogated and then taken away to be executed.
\p After that, Herod left Judea¦92458 and went up to Caesarea¦92461 to stay.
\s1 The death of Herod
\p
\v 20 Now King Herod was disputing with the people of Tyre¦92470 and Sidon, and so they got together and persuaded¦92488 Blastos¦92489, a close personal servant of the king, to be their¦92503 spokesman in asking for peace¦92499 because¦92500 they were dependent on food from the king's provinces.
\p
\v 21 On the agreed day¦92515, Herod¦92517 dressed¦92518 in his royal¦92520 garments and seated on his throne, started to address¦92526 them.
\v 22 The crowd shouted out, “This is the voice¦92539 of a god¦92538, not of a man¦92544.”
\v 23 Because he didn't attribute the honour to God¦92560, an angel¦92551 of the master¦92552 immediately¦92546 struck¦92549 him down and he stopped¦92572 breathing¦92572 as a result of a worm infestation.
\p
\v 24 Meanwhile God's message¦92575 continued to spread and¦92581 multiply¦92582.
\p
\v 25 By then Barnabas¦92583 and Saul had completed their ministry and returned to\f + \fr 12:25 \ft TD:Some manuscripts have ‘from’ here because in the next few sentences it seems that they were returned to Antioch.\f* Jerusalem¦92592 taking John¦92599 Mark along¦92596 with them.
\c 13
\s1 The spirit chooses Barnabas and Saul
\p
\v 1 In the assembly¦92612 at Antioch¦92608 there¦92604 were some prophets¦92613 and teachers¦92615: Barnabas¦92620, Simeon (called¦92625 Niger¦92626), Lucius from Cyrene, Manaen (who grew up with Herod¦92633 the tetrarch), and Saul¦92639.
\v 2 One day when they were ministering¦92640 to the master¦92644 and fasting¦92646, the pure¦92651 spirit¦92649 said¦92647, Appoint Barnabas¦92657 and Saul¦92660 to serve me and do the work that I have called¦92665 them to.”
\v 3 So they¦92677 fasted¦92668 and prayed¦92670 and placed their¦92674 hands¦92675 on the two, and then sent¦92677 them off.
\s1 Barnabas and Saul go to Cyprus to preach
\p
\v 4 So Barnabas and Saul, having¦92683 been sent¦92683 by the pure¦92688 spirit¦92689, went down to Seleucia¦92696 \add at the coast\add* and from there¦92697 sailed¦92700 on to \add the island of\add* Cyprus.
\v 5 When they arrived in \add the town of\add* Salamis¦92710, they proclaimed¦92713 God's message¦92716 in the Jewish¦92722 meeting¦92722 halls¦92722. They also had John¦92728 as their assistant.
\s1 Sergius believes after Bar-Jesus is blinded
\p
\v 6 They travelled around the island¦92739 and when they got to Paphos, they met a Jewish man¦92745 named Bar-Jesus.\f + \fr 13:6 \ft The Greek form of his name was Elymas according to verse 8.\f* He was a sorcerer and false¦92749 prophet¦92749
\v 7 who was with Sergius Paulus the proconsul¦92763, an intelligent¦92767 man¦92766. Sergius sent for Barnabas¦92771 and Saul¦92773 because he wanted to hear¦92778 God's message¦92780 from them,
\v 8 but the sorcerer opposed them and tried to prevent Sergius¦92786 from believing.
\v 9 So then Saul (the \add Roman\add* form of his name was Paul¦92810), filled¦92811 with the pure¦92813 spirit¦92812 looked¦92815 intently¦92815 at Bar-Jesus
\v 10 and said¦92818, “You're full of all kinds of deceit¦92822 and fraud¦92826 you child of the devil¦92829. Will you never stop twisting the truth about following the master¦92839?
\v 11 Well, look here! The master¦92849 will extend his power against you and blind¦92854 you—you'll go a season¦92861 without seeing¦92856 the sun!”
\p And immediately¦92862 he could only see fog and darkness¦92874, and needed someone to guide him around¦92876 by the hand.
\v 12 The proconsul¦92883 believed¦92888 when he saw what had happened, and was amazed¦92891 as he learnt about the master¦92898.
\s1 Paul and Barnabas in Pisidia
\p
\v 13 After that, Paul\f + \fr 13:13 \ft From this point on in the text, Paul is referred to by his Roman name as his ministry is largely outside of Israel. (In Israel he seemed to be better known as Saul, the Greek form of his Hebrew name Sha-ul.)\f* and his companions sailed from Paphos to Perga¦92911 in Pamphylia, but John¦92914 Mark left them and returned¦92919 to Jerusalem¦92922.
\v 14 Paul and his companions, went on from Perga¦92929 to Pisidian¦92937 Antioch¦92933, where they entered the Jewish¦92943 meeting¦92943 hall¦92943 on the Rest Day and sat¦92952 down \add with the congregation\add*.
\v 15 After the readings¦92956 from the Law and from the Prophets,\f + \fr 13:15 \ft The Hebrew Scriptures are divided into the Law, the Prophets, and the Writings.\f* the leaders¦92964 sent¦92962 a messenger over to them to ask, “Men, brothers¦92969, if you¦92977 bring any message¦92978 of encouragement for the congregation, please share it¦92983.”
\p
\v 16 So Paul¦92987 stood¦92984 up and motioning with his hand¦92991 started speaking, “Fellow Israelis and every who reveres¦92998 God¦93000, listen to me.
\v 17 The God¦93003 of the people of Israel chose¦93009 our¦93012 ancestors¦93011 and helped the people to prosper when they were staying in Egypt¦93025. Then later he showed his power as he led them out
\v 18 and¦93034 sustainedXXX them in the wilderness¦93045 for around forty¦93038 years.
\v 19 Then having¦93047 overthrown seven¦93049 nations¦93048 in Caanan\x + \xo 13:19: a \xt Deu 7:1; \xo b \xt Josh 14:1.\x*, he passed¦93053 on that land as an inheritance
\v 20 after¦93071 around 450 years¦93066.
\p “Then he gave¦93073 them judges¦93074 through until¦93075 the time of the prophet¦93078 Samuel
\v 21 when they¦93080 requested¦93080 a king¦93081, and¦93082 God¦93086 gave¦93083 them Saul, the son of Kish from the tribe¦93093 of Benjamin to reign for forty¦93096 years¦93095.
\v 22 After Saul was removed¦93098, God chose David to be their king¦93106—the man of whom he said, ‘I found¦93111 David the son of Jesse¦93116, a man who wants to obey me and do everything I ask.’
\v 23 Then eventually a descendant of David arrived in Israel as promised¦93137—the saviour¦93143 Yeshua¦93145.
\v 24 Before he arrived John-the-immerser had publicly¦93146 preached to all the people¦93157 of Israel about being immersed¦93153 \add as a sign\add* of repentance¦93154.
\v 25 As John's ministry was nearing an end, he asked, ‘Who do you suspect¦93172 I am? I'm not the messiah, but he will come after¦93180 me, and I'm not \add even\add* worthy¦93186 to undo his sandals¦93189.’
\p
\v 26 “Men, brothers¦93194, descendants¦93196 of Abraham¦93197 and¦93198 others here who revere¦93203 God¦93205, the teaching about this salvation¦93212 has been sent¦93214 to us.
\v 27 The people of Jerusalem¦93220 and their \add religious\add* leaders didn't recognise this \add Yeshua\add*, but by their judgement¦93242 of him¦93242 they¦93243 fulfilled¦93243 the words of the prophets¦93234 that are read every¦93237 Rest Day.
\v 28 Despite not finding even one charge against him worthy of death¦93247, they requested¦93254 Pilate¦93257 to execute him
\v 29 and when they had done all the things¦93270 that \add the prophets\add* had written¦93274 about him, they took his body down from the stake¦93289 and placed it in a burial chamber.
\v 30 But God¦93297 brought him¦93299 back to life
\v 31 and his¦93326 followers who had come¦93309 to Jerusalem¦93316 from Galilee¦93314 saw him for several days¦93306 and now testify about this to the people¦93329.
\v 32 So now we're¦93331 preaching¦93333 this good¦93333 message¦93333 to you¦93332 that what God promised¦93339 to our ancestors¦93337
\v 33 has now been fulfilled¦93346 for our¦93351 descendants, now that God¦93345 brought Yeshua¦93357 back to life just like it's written¦93371 in the second¦93373 psalm¦93369:
\q1 ‘You are my¦93376 son;
\q1 today¦93380 I have borne you.’
\m
\v 34 God brought him¦93405 back to life, and he's never going¦93409 to return¦93410 \add to the grave\add* to decay¦93412. As God said¦93414,
\q1 ‘I will give David's faithful¦93422 devout¦93419 \add things???\add* to you¦93417 all.’
\m
\v 35 So in another¦93427 psalm¦93427 God said,
\q1 ‘You won't allow your¦93434 devout¦93433 one to experience decay¦93436.’
\m
\v 36 This can't be David¦93437, because after he'd served his own generation¦93441 as God¦93445 led him, he indeed died and was buried with his ancestors¦93452 and his body decayed¦93456.
\v 37 On the contrary, the one who God¦93461 raised¦93462 from the dead never experienced decay¦93465.
\v 38 So brothers¦93472, let it¦93468 be known¦93466 to you all that your sins¦93480 can now be forgiven¦93478 through¦93474 this \add Yeshua\add*—the law of Moses was never able to offer you that.
\v 39 Everyone who puts their trust in \add Yeshua\add* is able to receive a clean record.
\v 40 But keep your eyes open in case something else the prophets¦93516 wrote might come¦93509 true:
\q1
\v 41 ‘Watch¦93517 you scoffers¦93519, and be amazed and die because¦93527 I'm doing¦93531 something special during your¦93536 time.
\q1 Even if someone¦93544 described¦93545 it clearly to you all, you still might not believe¦93542 it.’ ”
\p
\v 42 As they¦93558 left the meeting hall after¦93565 the service, the people invited them to speak again the following Rest Day.
\v 43 But when they starting walking away, many people followed¦93579 after¦93588 Paul¦93588 and Barnabas¦93591, who then addressed¦93593 them and encouraged them to continue trusting in God's grace¦93602.
\p
\v 44 So on the following Rest Day, nearly everyone in the city¦93626 had gathered¦93627 there to hear¦93628 the message¦93634 from God¦93639.
\v 45 But the Jewish religious leaders became very jealous¦93650 when they saw the crowds¦93647 and claimed that Paul's words had slandered¦93662 God.
\v 46 But Paul¦93668 and Barnabas¦93671 responded boldly¦93663, “It was necessary¦93678 for God's message¦93683 to be explained in the meeting hall to all of \add the Jews\add* first¦93679. But since you are rejecting that teaching, you are all judging¦93694 yourselves¦93697 to be unworthy of living forever, so instead, we will \add now\add* share it with the non-Jews¦93707.
\v 47 Because¦93709 this is what the master¦93714 commanded¦93710 us:
\q1 ‘I have chosen you to be a light¦93720 for the pagans¦93722;
\q2 You will take salvation¦93728 to the end of the earth¦93732.’
\p
\v 48 When the non-Jews¦93737 heard that, they¦93738 were very happy and were praising the master's¦93747 message¦93744, and as many as were appointed¦93752 to \add receive\add* eternal¦93755 life¦93754 believed¦93749 \add it¦93734\add*.
\p
\v 49 So from there, the master's¦93763 message¦93761 spread throughout the entire¦93766 region¦93768.
\v 50 But the Jewish religious leaders¦93783 incited¦93772 some prominent¦93779 women¦93776 from the meeting halls and some from the local city¦93785 government, and they then stirred¦93787 up persecution¦93791 against¦93792 Paul¦93794 and Barnabas¦93797 and had them expelled out of their¦93804 region¦93803.
\v 51 So Paul and Barnabas just left that place to face their own consequences, and continued on to Iconium.
\v 52 Meanwhile the believers \add back in Pisidian Antioch\add* were full of happiness and¦93826 of the pure¦93828 spirit¦93827.
\c 14
\s1 Paul and Barnabas in Iconium
\p
\v 1 A similar thing happened in Iconium. Paul and Barnabas went into the Jewish¦93841 meeting¦93841 hall¦93841 and spoke in such as way that a lot of both Jews¦93843 and Greeks believed¦93850.
\v 2 But those Jews who didn't believe got the non-Jews¦93883 emotionally stirred¦93872 up to oppose the believers¦93886.
\v 3 So Paul and Barnabas ended up staying there for quite a while, and as they spoke boldly¦93900 for the master¦93904, he himself confirmed his¦93912 grace¦93911 by eanbling the two of them to be able to do miracles and amazing things.
\v 4 Nevertheless, the people¦93930 of the city¦93932 were divided¦93925—some agreeing with the \add strict\add* Jews¦93939, and others supporting the missionaries¦93945.
\p
\v 5 At one point, both the non-Jews¦93957 and the strict Jews and their¦93965 leaders got worked up enough to come in order to attack them and throw¦93968 rocks to kill them.
\v 6 However, Paul and Barnabas found out about it and escaped to the Lycaonian cities¦93975 of Lystra and Derbe and the surrounding¦93984 region¦93984
\v 7 and¦93986 preached¦93988 the good¦93988 message¦93988 there¦93986.
\s1 A miracle in Lystra following by a stoning
\p
\v 8 In Lystra there was a man¦94008 sitting¦94016 there who had been unable to use his¦94022 legs since birth.
\v 9 He was listening to Paul speaking¦94035, when Paul looked¦94040 straight at him¦94042 and¦94045 realised that the man¦94028 had the faith¦94050 to be healed¦94052.
\v 10 So in a loud¦94054 voice¦94056, Paul said¦94053, “Stand¦94066 upright on your¦94070 feet¦94069.” And the man sprang¦94080 up and was walking¦94083 around.
\v 11 The crowd¦94087 of people who saw what Paul¦94093 had done began to shout out in Lycaonian, “These two look like men¦94104, but they're really gods¦94101 who have come down to us!”
\v 12 They called Barnabas¦94114 ‘Zeus’ and called Paul¦94119 ‘Hermas¦94120’ since¦94122 he was the main speaker.
\v 13 And the priest¦94134 of Zeus wanted to sacrifice¦94161 with the crowds¦94157, so he brought¦94153 bulls¦94146 and garlands¦94149 \add of flowers\add* to the city gates¦94152 from \add the temple\add* on the path to the city.
\p
\v 14 But when the missionaries¦94166 Barnabas¦94167 and Paul¦94169 heard¦94162 what was going on, they tore their clothes \add in dismay\add* as they rushed¦94176 out into the crowd¦94181
\v 15 shouting, “Men, why are you doing¦94190 all these things? We are only humans¦94197 just like all of you. We were bringing you the good message about abandoning these useless¦94208 \add sacrifices\add* and turning¦94210 to the living¦94216 God¦94214 who made heaven¦94222 and the earth¦94225 and the sea¦94228 and everything in them.\x + \xo 14:15: \xt Exo 20:11.\x*
\v 16 In previous generations¦94239 he allowed¦94240 all the nations¦94244 to go their¦94248 own different ways¦94247,
\v 17 but he¦94274 never left himself without¦94254 evidence of himself—sending good¦94260 rains¦94264 from heaven¦94261 to give you all fruitful¦94269 seasons¦94268 with food to fill \add your stomachs\add* and happiness to fill your hearts¦94275.”
\v 18 By saying¦94280 these¦94279 things¦94279, they¦94283 were eventually just able to restrain¦94283 the people from sacrificing¦94289 to them.
\p
\v 19 But some \add strict\add* Jews¦94315 came over from \add Pisidian\add* Antioch¦94307 and Iconium and were able to persuade¦94320 the crowds¦94324. They threw rocks at Paul¦94341 \add to kill him\add* and dragged¦94343 his body outside¦94345 the city¦94347 \add gates\add* thinking¦94348 that he was dead.
\v 20 But as the believers were standing around him, Paul got up and went back into the city¦94367, but he left¦94372 again with Barnabas¦94375 the next day¦94369 and went to Derbe.
\s1 Paul and Barnabas return to the sending assembly in Antioch
\p
\v 21 They preached¦94378 the good¦94378 message¦94378 in Derbe, and after giving further training¦94390 to many of them, they¦94394 returned¦94394 to Lystra and Iconium and Antioch¦94404.
\v 22 There they strengthened¦94405 the faith¦94416 of the believers—encouraging them to continue believing and¦94417 to expect that it's normal to endure a lot of suffering on the path to God's kingdom¦94429.
\v 23 They appointed some elders for \add each\add* assembly¦94437, then they fasted and prayed¦94439 for the elders—asking the master¦94446 that they believed¦94449 in to look after them.
\p
\v 24 After passing through¦94452 Pisidia¦94456, they¦94457 arrived at Pamphylia
\v 25 and¦94462 after teaching the master's message¦94470 in Perga¦94467, they¦94473 went down to \add the coastal city of\add* Attalia¦94475.
\v 26 From there¦94478, they sailed¦94479 \add back\add* to \add Syrian\add* Antioch¦94481 where the congregation had prayed for God's grace¦94486 to be with them\x + \xo 14:26: \xt 13:3.\x* for the work they had just fulfilled¦94493.
\p
\v 27 So when they arrived¦94494, they gathered¦94497 the assembly¦94500 together¦94497 there and shared about what God¦94506 had done with them and how he had opened¦94515 up the door¦94518 of faith¦94519 to the non-Jews¦94517.
\v 28 Then they¦94520 stayed on with them there for quite a while.
\c 15
\s1 The decision from the Jerusalem elders
\p
\v 1 Then some \add people\add* came \add to Antioch\add* from Judea¦94534 and were teaching the believers¦94537 that according to Moses' teachings, you can't be saved¦94554 unless you've been circumcised¦94543.
\v 2 This led to no end of argument and debate¦94562 between them and Paul¦94566 and Barnabas until it was decided that the two of them and some other¦94601 believers should go to Jerusalem¦94614 to ask the missionaries¦94609 and the elders¦94612 there about¦94619 this issue.
\p
\v 3 So indeed¦94624 the assembly¦94629 sent¦94626 the group on their way, and as they passed through¦94630 Phoenicia and Samaria¦94636, they described¦94638 how non-Jews¦94642 had bcome believers and this news made the believers there¦94625 very happy.
\p
\v 4 When they arrived¦94650 in Jerusalem¦94653, they were welcomed by the assembly¦94662 and the missionaries¦94665 and the elders¦94668, and they explained how God¦94675 had used them.
\v 5 But some of the believers¦94699 who were also members of the Pharisee¦94698 party¦94698 stood up and said, “It's quite proper for them to be circumcised¦94703 and to be commanded¦94705 to keep the Jewish religious laws.”
\p
\v 6 So the missionaries¦94716 and¦94717 the elders¦94719 met separately in order to consider the matter¦94723 further.
\v 7 After a lot of debate¦94728, Peter stood¦94755 up and said, “Men, brothers¦94765, all of you here know that some time back, God¦94777 chose¦94775 me to be a mouthpiece¦94783 so that the non-Jews¦94787 could hear the good message and believe¦94793.
\v 8 And God¦94799 who knows even people's inner thoughts, gave them the same pure¦94811 spirit¦94809 that he gave us,
\v 9 and when he purified¦94825 their¦94828 minds by the faith¦94824, he didn't do anything different for them than he did for us.
\v 10 So why are you¦94832 all provoking God¦94834 by putting a load on the shoulders of these believers that neither¦94843 we¦94848, nor our¦94846 ancestors¦94845, were ever able to bear?
\v 11 But we¦94859 ourselves have believed¦94859 thanks to the grace¦94854 of Yeshua¦94857 the master¦94856, and they can be saved¦94861 in just the same way.”
\p
\v 12 The whole group sat in silence¦94875, and then they listened to Barnabas¦94883 and Paul¦94886 as they described everything that God¦94893 had done among¦94897 the non-Jews¦94899 through them, including miracles and amazing things.
\v 13 Then while they were still silent¦94905, Jacob¦94909 responded, “Men, brothers¦94913, listen to me.
\v 14 Simon Peter has told us how God¦94921 first¦94919 intervened in order to select a people¦94927 for himself from among the non-Jews¦94925.
\v 15 And this actually agrees¦94935 with the message¦94938 that the prophets¦94940 recorded,
\q1
\v 16 ‘After¦94943 these¦94945 things¦94945 have happened I will return¦94947,
\q1 and I will rebuild the worship tent from David's time that has collapsed,
\q1 Although it was overturned¦94958, I will rebuild and restore¦94964 it,
\q1
\v 17 so that the remaining people¦94972 will want to find the master,
\q1 and also the non-Jews¦94979 who cried out to me.
\q1 The master who is doing¦94991 these¦94993 things¦94993 is saying¦94988 this,
\q1
\v 18 and planned it this way from eternity¦94998.’
\p
\v 19 Because of this, my ruling is not to be troubling¦95013 the non-Jews¦95017 who are turning¦95018 back to God¦95021,
\v 20 but to write¦95023 to them to keep away from anything polluted¦95029 by idols¦95031, from sexual¦95034 immorality¦95034, and from strangled¦95037 animals¦95037 and \add eating or drinking\add* blood¦95040.
\v 21 Moses' writings have been preached in every city¦95057 and are read in \add our\add* meeting¦95069 halls¦95069 on every Rest Day.
\s1 The letter is carried to Antioch
\p
\v 22 So the missionaries¦95078 and elders¦95081 with all the assembly¦95085 decided to choose some men to accompany Paul¦95095 and Barnabas¦95097 to Antioch¦95092, so they chose¦95086 Judas (nicknamed Barsabbas¦95102) and Silas¦95105 who were leaders among¦95109 the believers¦95111,
\v 23 This is what they wrote: This letter is from the missionaries¦95122 and elders¦95125, your brothers \add here in Jerusalem\add* to our non-Jewish fellow believers¦95128 in Antioch¦95132 and Syria and Cilicia.
\v 24 Since¦95146 we heard¦95149 that some people who weren't sent by us came from here and disturbed¦95157 you all with their upsetting¦95160 messages¦95159,
\v 25 we unanimously agreed to select some men¦95179 to accompany our¦95187 dear \add friends\add* Barnabas¦95188 and¦95189 Paul¦95190 back.
\v 26 These are men¦95191 who have dedicated their¦95198 lives¦95196 to our¦95204 master¦95203, Yeshua¦95205 the messiah¦95206.
\v 27 So we've sent¦95210 Judas¦95212 and Silas¦95214 and they'll confirm in person what we are writing.
\v 28 It seemed right to the pure¦95229 spirit¦95227 and¦95231 to us to not burden¦95240 you¦95239 all with anything more than the following commands:
\v 29 you all must keep away from anything sacrificed¦95247 to idols, from \add eating or drinking\add* blood¦95249 or strangled¦95252 animals¦95252, and from sexual¦95254 immorality¦95254. You will do well if you avoid these things¦95247. Farewell.
\p
\v 30 So they were sent¦95280 off and when they arrived at Antioch¦95287, they gathered¦95289 the believers and handed¦95293 across the letter¦95295,
\v 31 and when they read it¦95296, they were very happy with the encouraging contents.
\p
\v 32 Judas and Barnabas were both prophets¦95309, and said a lot to encourage them and strengthen¦95323 \add their faith\add*.
\v 33 After they'd stayed there¦95327 for a while, the believers¦95333 sent them home carrying greetings from them to the assembly \add back in Jerusalem\add*.
\p
\v 34 ≈
\v 35 But Paul¦95355 and Barnabas¦95358 stayed on there in Antioch¦95361, teaching¦95362 them and preaching¦95364 the good message along with many others¦95368.
\s1 Paul and Barnabas go separate ways
\p
\v 36 After a few days¦95377, Paul¦95383 suggested to Barnabas¦95382, “Let's go back and visit¦95387 the believers¦95389 in each city¦95394 where we proclaimed¦95400 the master's¦95404 message¦95402, and see how they're doing.”
\v 37 Barnabas¦95407 agreed and wanted to take¦95412 John¦95416 Mark¦95420 along¦95412 with them as well,
\v 38 but Paul¦95421 didn't want to take him because he had left them in Pamphylia¦95434 instead of continuing with them in their work.
\v 39 And so it turned into such a disagreement that the two of them each went their different ways. Barnabas¦95465 took John Mark with him and¦95464 sailed to Cyprus
\v 40 while Paul¦95476 chose¦95479 Silas¦95480 and they left¦95481 after being entrusted to the master's¦95486 grace¦95484 by the believers¦95491.
\v 41 They went through¦95492 Syria and¦95499 Cilicia, strengthening¦95504 the assemblies¦95506 there.
\c 16
\s1 Paul and Silas also take Timothy with them
\p
\v 1 Then Paul went to Derbe and¦95522 then on to Lystra where a believer named Timothy¦95533 lived. His mother was a Jewish believer, but¦95540 his father¦95539 was Greek.
\v 2 The believers¦95551 in Lystra and¦95548 Iconium spoke well of Timothy
\v 3 and Paul¦95555 wanted¦95553 him to accompany them on his trip so he circumcised¦95563 him \add in advance\add* because¦95566 of the Jews¦95568 in that region—everyone knew that his father¦95583 was a Greek¦95580.
\v 4 As they passed through¦95592 various towns, they explained the decision of the missionaries¦95619 and elders¦95622 in Jerusalem¦95626 about which commands they must adhere to.
\v 5 So the assemblies¦95630 were strengthened¦95631 in this way and¦95634 their numbers¦95637 were increasing each day¦95639.
\s1 Paul's vision in Troas
\p
\v 6 From there, they¦95641 travelled through¦95641 Phrygia and¦95645 the Galatia¦95647 region¦95648, after the pure¦95652 spirit¦95653 prevented them from proclaiming the message¦95657 in Asia.
\v 7 When they got to Mysia, they planned to go on into Bithynia, but Yeshua's¦95685 spirit¦95683 didn't let them,
\v 8 so after leaving Mysia they¦95692 went to Troas.
\v 9 During the night¦95701, Paul¦95704 had a vision¦95697 of a Macedonian man¦95707 standing there and imploring¦95716 him¦95717, “Come on to Macedonia¦95708 and help¦95725 us here.”
\v 10 So as a result of the vision¦95733, we¦95740 decided to go straight to Macedonia¦95744, concluding¦95745 that God¦95750 had called¦95747 us to share the good message with them.
\s1 Lydia's enthusiasm at Philippi
\p
\v 11 From Troas we¦95768 sailed directly to Samothrace¦95770, and¦95773 then on to Neapolis the following¦95775 day¦95772.
\v 12 From there¦95781 we continued on to Philippi which¦95786 is a \add Roman\add* colony¦95796 and the capital city of the Macedonia¦95794 district¦95792 where we stayed for several days.
\v 13 On the Rest Days, we went \add down\add* to the river¦95821 outside¦95815 the \add city\add* gate where¦95822 we thought people might be praying, and we spoke to the women¦95837 who had met there.
\v 14 One of them was Lydia from Thyatira who was a seller¦95843 of purple goods\f + \fr 16:14 \ft It's possible that Lydia dyed fabric and sold it, or that she actually made and sold the purple dye itself.\f* and although she already worshipped¦95847 God¦95850, the master¦95855 opened¦95856 her¦95857 mind¦95858 and she readily accepted what Paul¦95864 was saying.
\v 15 So then Lydia and her¦95872 household were all \add ceremonially\add* immersed¦95867, and then she requested, “If you all consider me to be faithful¦95878 to the master¦95881, come¦95883 and stay at my¦95889 place.” So she persuaded us.
\s1 Paul and Silas get thrown into prison
\p
\v 16 One time as we were walking to the prayer¦95902 meeting, we met a female slave who was possessed by a spirit¦95907 that enabled her to tell fortunes¦95924, and thanks to that, to earn a lot of money for her masters¦95920.
\v 17 She walked along behind us and shouted out, “These¦95937 men¦95939 are slaves¦95940 of the highest¦95944 god¦95942 and they will be telling you¦95949 all how to be saved.”
\v 18 After she'd done this for several days¦95958, Paul¦95963 was so frustrated that he turned¦95965 around and spoke to the spirit¦95967 \add in her\add*, “I command¦95971 you by the authority of Yeshua¦95976 the messiah¦95977 to leave her.”
\p
\v 19 But when her¦96000 masters¦95999 realised that their¦96010 profitable business¦96009 was about to come to an end, they¦96021 grabbed Paul¦96017 and Silas¦96020 and dragged¦96021 them to the authorities at the marketplace¦96024.
\v 20 They brought¦96029 them forward¦96029 to face the magistrates and¦96028 said¦96034, “These¦96036 Jews¦96044 are disturbing¦96039 \add the peace\add* in our¦96041 city¦96043
\v 21 and¦96046 teaching behaviour that we as Romans can neither accept¦96056 nor practice¦96060.”
\v 22 An \add angry\add* crowd¦96068 gathered around and the magistrates ordered for Paul and Silas to have their¦96078 robes¦96080 torn off and then to be beaten with rods.
\v 23 They were severely beaten and then thrown¦96089 into prison where the officer was commanded¦96092 to keep them secure¦96097.
\v 24 Because of that, he threw them into the inner¦96113 cell and locked their¦96116 feet¦96117 in stocks¦96126.
\p
\v 25 Around midnight¦96131 Paul¦96136 and Silas¦96139 were praying¦96140 and singing¦96141 praises to God¦96143, and the other prisoners¦96150 were listening¦96144 to them.
\v 26 Suddenly there was a strong earthquake¦96153 that shook even the foundations¦96159 of the prison, and immediately¦96167 all the prison doors¦96169 opened¦96162 up and the chains of all the prisoners came loose.
\v 27 The prison officer woke up, and when he saw that all the prison doors¦96187 were open, he drew his sword¦96194 to take his own life as he figured that all the prisoners must have escaped¦96201.
\v 28 But Paul¦96211 shouted out, “Don't harm yourself¦96215! We're all still here!”
\p
\v 29 The officer called for torches, then rushed¦96227 in and knelt down trembling¦96229 in front of Paul¦96237 and Silas¦96240.
\v 30 Then he escorted them out and asked, “Masters¦96254, what do I need to do to be saved¦96260?”
\p
\v 31 “Believe¦96265 in the master¦96269 Yeshua¦96270,” they replied, “then you and your¦96278 household¦96277 can all be saved¦96273.”
\v 32 Then they explained the message¦96283 about the master¦96286 to him and all those in his¦96294 household¦96293.
\v 33 Even though it was still the middle of the night¦96304, he sponged their¦96308 wounds¦96309, and then him and his¦96320 household were all immersed¦96312 straight away.
\v 34 He took Paul and Silas up into his house¦96332 and gave them a meal, and his whole household were happy because¦96336 they now believed¦96345 in God¦96349.
\p
\v 35 The next day¦96351 the magistrates sent¦96355 officials¦96358 to tell the jailer to release Paul and Silas.
\p
\v 36 So the officer told Paul¦96398, “The magistrates \add sent these officials\add* to order¦96405 that you two to be released.”
\p
\v 37 But Paul¦96417 responded, “You mean that after publicly¦96424 beating us Roman men¦96426 without a trial, they threw us into prison¦96434 and now they want to just quietly release us.”
\p
\v 38 So the officials¦96454 reported¦96447 this back to the magistrates, and they were quite afraid¦96468 when they heard¦96471 that Paul and Silas were Roman \add citizens\add*.
\v 39 So now they came to the prison in person, and appealed¦96485 to them, and escorting them out of prison themselves, asked them to please leave the city¦96509.
\v 40 So after Paul and Silas left the prison¦96524, they went to see Lydia and after encouraging the believers¦96535 there, they left.
\c 17
\s1 Jason gets in trouble in Thessalonica
\p
\v 1 After travelling¦96547 through¦96547 Amphipolis and Apollonia¦96554, Paul and Silas went to Thessalonica¦96562 where¦96563 there was a Jewish¦96566 meeting¦96566 hall¦96566.
\v 2 Paul's custom was to attend at the local meeting hall on the Rest Day, so he did that, and for three weekends in a row he discussed¦96585 the scriptures¦96592 with them,
\v 3 showing them how that it¦96599 \add had been written\add* that the messiah would suffer¦96600 and be killed and come back to life, and then explaining, “This Yeshua¦96612 that I've been telling you¦96617 about is the messiah.”
\v 4 Some of them were persuaded¦96622 and joined¦96624 with Paul¦96626 and Silas¦96629, along with a big group of godly Greeks and quite a few prominent women¦96643.
\p
\v 5 But some of the other Jews¦96656 were envious \add of them\add*, and enlisted some of the trouble-makers from the marketplaces¦96663 to form a mob. They stirred up all the people, and looking¦96682 for¦96682 Paul and Silas so they could bring¦96685 them out, arrived at the house¦96680 of a man named Jason.
\v 6 But when they realised that Paul and Silas weren't there, they dragged¦96694 Jason and some other believers¦96703 off to the city¦96706 leaders, shouting¦96707, “Those two men who've gone around upsetting¦96715 the whole world¦96714 have now come here as well
\v 7 and Jason has welcomed¦96722 them \add into his house\add*. They rebel against Caesar's decrees¦96729 and claim that Yeshua¦96738 is a rival king¦96733.
\v 8 They¦96740 stirred up the crowd¦96744 and¦96745 the city¦96747 leaders with these¦96753 accusations,
\v 9 so the leaders collected a heavy fine from Jason¦96760 and the others, and then released them.
\s1 Many new believers in Berea
\p
\v 10 So the believers¦96768 immediately¦96769 sent¦96774 Paul¦96777 and¦96778 Silas¦96780 off during the night¦96773 to go to Berea. In Berea they also attended at the Jewish¦96788 meeting¦96788 hall¦96788
\v 11 and this group were more upper-class than the congregation in Thessalonica¦96801. They eagerly accepted the message¦96805 and examined¦96812 the scriptures¦96814 every¦96810 day¦96811 to check if what was being taught matched what was written there.
\v 12 Because it did, many of the people believed¦96828 including quite a few of the prominent¦96840 Greeks.
\v 13 But when the Jews¦96857 from Thessalonica¦96856 found out that God's message¦96868 was also being proclaimed¦96863 by Paul¦96866 there¦96881 in Berea, they¦96877 soon turned up to agitate¦96882 and¦96883 stir the crowds¦96886.
\v 14 So the believers¦96898 immediately¦96889 sent¦96896 Paul¦96895 off to the coast, but Silas¦96914 and Timothy¦96917 both stayed.
\v 15 The ones guiding Paul¦96925 took him to Athens before they headed back with his instructions for Silas¦96949 and Timothy¦96952 to come¦96959 and join him again as soon as possible.
\s1 People of Athens like new ideas
\p
\v 16 While Paul¦96972 stayed in Athens waiting for them, he was upset in his¦96976 spirit¦96975 as he observed¦96980 how idolatrous¦96981 the people were.
\v 17 So while he stayed busy having discussions¦96985 with the Jews¦96992 and other worshippers¦96995 from the meeting¦96990 hall¦96990, he also spent time every¦97002 day¦97003 with whoever just happened¦97006 to be around in the marketplace¦97000.
\v 18 Some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers¦97015 enjoyed discussing things with him, but others just mocked him, “What does this babbler¦97027 want to talk about now?”
\p But others said, “Seems that he's talking¦97021 about strange¦97033 demons¦97034,” because¦97038 he was preaching¦97045 the good¦97045 message¦97045 about Yeshua¦97040 and coming back to life.
\v 19 So they grabbed him and brought¦97061 him to the Aries Hill \add where the council sat\add* and asked, “Are we allowed to know¦97067 what this new teaching¦97078 that you're bringing is about?
\v 20 It seems that you¦97083 have some surprising¦97079 ideas for our¦97090 ears¦97089, so we¦97091 want to hear what it's all about.”
\v 21 (Everyone in Athens and¦97104 even visitors¦97106 often took the opportunity¦97113 either to explain or to listen to any new things.)
\p
\v 22 So Paul¦97126 stood¦97123 up in the middle of the gathering on the hill and spoke, “Men of Athens, I've noticed how you¦97140 all are very religious,
\v 23 because as I was looking around and observing¦97146 your¦97150 objects¦97149 of worship, I even discovered an altar¦97153 that was inscribed¦97158, ‘To the unknown¦97159 god¦97160.’ So without knowing¦97164 it, you already worship this God¦97160 that I'm going to tell you about.
\v 24 This God¦97173 who created the earth and everything in it¦97182 is the master¦97189 of heaven¦97184 and earth. He doesn't live in man-made temples¦97193
\v 25 nor can he be repaired by any human¦97201 hands¦97200 and he doesn't need to be fed. \add On the contrary\add*, he's the one who gives life¦97215 and breath¦97217 and who gives us everything that we need.
\v 26 From one man he made every¦97227 nationality¦97228 that lives across all the earth¦97239 and designated¦97240 their boundaries¦97247 and their futures.
\v 27 He made them so that they would try to discover God¦97256, and if they did search for him they might find him as he's not far from any one of us
\v 28 because
\q1 ‘We live in him and are moved¦97291 by him and exist through him.’
\m Even some of your own poets¦97306 wrote,
\q1 ‘We are all descended¦97312 from just one.’
\m
\v 29 So since we are God's offspring, we shouldn't be putting gold¦97323 or silver¦97327 or stone¦97329 craftmanship¦97331 in the same class as the divine¦97337.
\v 30 In fact God¦97350 overlooked¦97348 times¦97343 of such ignorance¦97345 in the past, but now he's informing everyone¦97361 and requiring them to repent¦97362
\v 31 because he's set a date for when he's going¦97370 to be fairly judging¦97371 the world¦97374. He's already appointed the judge who everyone can have faith¦97382 in because he brought¦97383 him back to life from the dead¦97389.
\p
\v 32 When they heard¦97390 about a dead¦97393 person coming back to life, some started mocking¦97396 but others¦97398 said¦97399, “We'd like to hear¦97401 more about this from you¦97402 another time.”
\v 33 So Paul¦97411 left¦97412 at that stage
\v 34 but some people joined¦97419 with him¦97421 and believed¦97422, including Dionysius who was a council member, a woman¦97432 named Damaris¦97434, and others¦97436 as well.
\c 18
\s1 Paul resides in Corinth for some time
\p
\v 1 After¦97441 this, Paul left Athens and travelled to Corinth.
\v 2 There he came across a Jew¦97457 named Aquila who had been born in Pontus¦97460 but who had recently¦97463 moved from Italy along with his¦97472 wife¦97471 Priscilla because¦97473 \add Emperor\add* Claudius had ordered all Jews¦97482 to leave Rome. So Paul approached¦97493 them,
\v 3 and since they worked in the same¦97501 trade¦97501, he ended up staying with them and they worked together in their craft¦97516 of tent-making.
\v 4 On every¦97528 Rest Day, Paul debated in the Jewish¦97525 meeting¦97525 hall¦97525, and was persuading¦97539 both Jews¦97544 and Greeks.
\p
\v 5 However when Silas¦97558 and¦97559 Timothy¦97561 arrived from Macedonia¦97554, Paul¦97567 was able to devote his full time to the message¦97564—demonstrating to the Jews¦97571 that Yeshua¦97576 is the \add promised\add* messiah¦97574.
\v 6 But when they opposed¦97584 \add the message\add* and made false accusations, he \add publicly\add* brushed \add the dust\add* off his clothes¦97595\f + \fr 18:6 \ft In the culture, this was a demonstration that you're not responsible for their decision(s).\f* and said¦97597, “Your¦97602 future deaths are your own problem. I'm innocent \add of your guilt.\add* From now on, I'll going¦97616 to the non-Jews¦97615.”
\v 7 So Paul left there¦97623, and went to stay at the house of a man named Titus Justus¦97635 who worshipped¦97636 God¦97638 and whose house was next-door to the meeting¦97645 hall¦97645.
\v 8 Krispo¦97646 the meeting¦97650 hall¦97650 leader¦97650 and all his¦97662 household¦97661 decided to follow the master¦97656, and many of the Corinthians¦97666 believed¦97652 after they heard \add the message\add* and were immersed¦97670.
\p
\v 9 Then the master¦97685 spoke to Paul¦97694 one night¦97687 in a vision¦97689, “Don't be afraid and¦97701 stay silent¦97703, but¦97699 keep¦97703 speaking¦97700 out
\v 10 because I am with you and no one can mistreat¦97715 you here because there¦97719 are many of my people¦97718 in this city¦97724.”
\v 11 So Paul stayed on for eighteen months¦97736, teaching¦97738 God's message¦97743 to the people there.
\p
\v 12 Then at the time when Gallio¦97746 was the proconsul¦97750 of Achaia, the Jews¦97757 united against Paul¦97765 and¦97767 brought a case to the tribunal¦97776 against him¦97772
\v 13 saying¦97779, “This man¦97786 is going against the law by persuading¦97785 people¦97788 to be worshipping¦97789 \add his\add* God¦97791.”
\p
\v 14 But as Paul¦97795 opening¦97796 his mouth¦97798 to speak, Gallio¦97801 said¦97799 to the Jews, “I would have accepted this charge if it¦97809 was a serious wrong¦97811 or evil¦97815 crime¦97814 and¦97807 would have listened to you¦97824 Jews.
\v 15 However, since it's a question¦97829 about¦97832 a message¦97833 and names¦97835 and your own law, you all can see to it yourselves¦97842 because I don't¦97847 want to get involved in judging things¦97846 like that.”
\v 16 So he sent them away from the tribunal¦97857,
\v 17 but they¦97868 grabbed Sosthenes, the leader¦97867 from the meeting¦97867 hall¦97867, and beat him¦97868 up right there in front of the tribunal¦97871. But Gallio¦97877 took action to stop them.
\s1 Paul returns to Syrian Antioch
\p
\v 18 Paul¦97882 stayed on for quite a few days¦97886 after that, then he farewelled the believers¦97889 and went to Cenchrea where he had his hair cut as was the custom for someone making a vow. Then taking Priscilla and Aquila with him, he sailed towards Syria.
\v 19 When they arrived¦97913 at Ephesus¦97918, he left the other two there while he went into the Jewish¦97934 meeting¦97934 hall¦97934 and had a discussion¦97937 with the Jews¦97939 there.
\v 20 They asked him¦97940 to remain¦97948 longer, but he¦97952 turned them down
\v 21 although as he gave his farewells, he said¦97958, “I'll come back here again if God¦97977 wills it,” then he sailed on from Ephesus¦97985.
\p
\v 22 When he landed at Caesarea¦97989, he went \add to Jerusalem\add* and greeted¦97993 the assembly¦97995 there before continuing on to Antioch¦97998.
\v 23 He stayed there for some time¦98001 before travelling through the regions¦98009 of Galatia¦98008 and¦98010 Phrygia strengthening¦98014 \add the faith of\add* the believers \add through his teaching\add*.
\s1 Apollos teaches in Ephesus and Corinth
\p
\v 24 Meanwhile a Jewish man¦98029 named Apollos¦98022 (who had been born in \add the city of\add* Alexandria¦98025) arrived¦98031 in Ephesus¦98033. He knew the \add Hebrew\add* scriptures¦98038 well
\v 25 and had been taught¦98061 about the master's¦98051 way¦98048. Being¦98072 a very enthusiastic person, he started teaching¦98061 about Yeshua¦98066, even though he didn't know about being¦98053 filled with the spirit¦98055.\x + \xo 18:25: \xt 2:1-4.\x*
\v 26 So Apollos started speaking¦98076 out boldly¦98076 in the Jewish¦98079 meeting¦98079 hall¦98079. Priscilla and Aquila listened to him, then asked to speak with him privately and explained¦98096 God's way¦98098 more accurately.
\v 27 Now Apollos wanted to go to Achaia, so the believers encouraged¦98143 him and sent a letter ahead of him to tell the believers there to welcome¦98149 him, so when he arrived¦98152 there, he was able to contribute¦98155 a lot to those who through God's grace¦98165 had also become believers.
\v 28 Apollos was \add also\add* able to thoroughly¦98170 refute¦98170 the arguments of the Jews¦98169 and used the scriptures¦98177 to show that Yeshua¦98182 is the messiah¦98180.
\c 19
\s1 Many filled with the spirit in Ephesus
\p
\v 1 So then while Apollos¦98192 was at Corinth, Paul¦98197 travelled through¦98215 the interior regions before arriving at Ephesus¦98225. He found some followers¦98230 there,
\v 2 and asked them if they had received¦98241 the pure spirit when they had \add first\add* believed¦98242 \add in Yeshua\add*.
\p They replied, “We hadn't even heard¦98257 that there's¦98256 a pure spirit.”
\p
\v 3 “So then what were you¦98269 immmersed into?” asked Paul.
\p “With John's immersion¦98278,” they¦98270 answered.
\p
\v 4 Then Paul¦98282 said, “John¦98283 immersed people¦98289 \add in water\add* with an immersion¦98286 that went with repentance¦98287 \add from their sins\add*, but he told them to believe in the one who would follow him, that is to believe in Yeshua¦98303.”
\p
\v 5 When the followers heard¦98304 this, they¦98307 were immersed¦98307 \add in water again, this time proclaiming their faith\add* in Yeshua¦98313 the master¦98312.
\v 6 Then Paul¦98325 placed his hands¦98327 on them \add and prayed\add* and the pure¦98334 spirit¦98332 came¦98330 \add down\add* onto them and they started speaking in other languages¦98342 and speaking messages from God.
\v 7 There were about¦98351 twelve¦98352 men¦98350 in the group.
\p
\v 8 So Paul started going to the Jewish¦98360 meeting¦98360 hall¦98360 and for the next three¦98367 months¦98366 he boldy discussed¦98368 and persuaded¦98370 them about God's kingdom¦98374.
\v 9 But as some of them refused to believe and became hardened¦98383 against his teaching and started telling everyone¦98404 that the \add Yeshua\add* way¦98388 was evil¦98386, Paul stopped teaching in the meeting hall and taught the followers¦98402 at Turannos's¦98410 school¦98409 instead.
\v 10 This went on for two¦98423 years¦98422 to the point that everyone in Asia, whether Jews¦98444 or Greeks, heard the message¦98439 about Yeshua.
\s1 The power of the master's message
\p
\v 11 And God¦98458 was doing¦98459 incredible miracles¦98450 through Paul¦98463
\v 12 such that even if handkerchiefs¦98475 or aprons¦98478 that had touched his¦98474 skin were placed on top of any person who was sick or troubled with demons, then they would recover and the evil¦98489 spirits¦98487 would leave them.
\v 13 But some of the Jewish exorcists¦98504 going¦98501 around¦98501 attempted¦98494 to use the name¦98514 of Yeshua to drive out evil¦98512 spirits¦98510 by telling them, “I am imploring¦98521 you¦98522 all by Yeshua that Paul¦98529 preaches about.”
\v 14 Seven sons¦98546 of the Jewish chief¦98543 priest¦98543, Sceva were doing¦98551 this.
\p
\v 15 But the evil¦98588 spirit¦98586 would answer¦98582 them saying, “I know Yeshua¦98593 and¦98595 I recognise¦98598 Paul¦98597, but¦98600 who are you¦98599?”
\p
\v 16 Then the man¦98611 who had the evil¦98620 spirit¦98618 would jump on them and beat them up so they'd end up escaping¦98635 out of the house¦98639 naked¦98632 and wounded¦98634.
\v 17 When everyone in Ephesus¦98653 heard about this, both Jews¦98646 and Greeks were frightened, and the name¦98666 of Yeshua¦98669 the master¦98668 was being¦98664 honoured.
\v 18 Many of the people who believed¦98674 \add in Yeshua\add* came and confessed¦98677 \add their¦98682 sins\add* and wrong practices¦98681.
\v 19 Lots of the people who'd practiced¦98690 magic¦98689 brought¦98691 their¦98693 scrolls¦98694 and burnt them in front of the others. When the values of all of these were added up, it was \add huge\add*—worth around 50,000 silver¦98705 pieces.
\v 20 So that was how the master's¦98718 message¦98721 had a powerful¦98710 effect and¦98723 won over many people.
\s1 The silversmiths start a rucus in Ephesus
\p
\v 21 After all of this, Paul¦98734 decided in his spirit¦98738 that he would need to travel through¦98739 Macedonia¦98742 and Achaia enroute to Jerusalem¦98750, saying, “After I've been there¦98757 a while, I will also need to go to Rome.”
\v 22 He sent¦98764 two¦98769 of his workers, Timothy¦98776 and Eratos, to Macedonia¦98768 while he stayed on a bit longer in Asia \add Minor\add*.
\p
\v 23 But while he¦98799 was still there, a major disturbance¦98795 hit the Yeshua followers.
\v 24 A silversmith¦98806 named Demetrius¦98801 made \add little¦98820\add* silver¦98810 shrines of Artemas¦98812 and this business¦98821 brought a tidy profit to the local craftsmen¦98817.
\v 25 Artmeas gathered all the workers¦98832 together¦98824 and told them, “Men, you¦98840 all know that our prosperity¦98847 comes from this business¦98845 of ours.
\v 26 But you've seen yourselves and heard from others that not only Ephesus¦98862, but almost¦98865 our¦98887 entire¦98852 \add province of\add* Asia has become¦98888 persuaded¦98874 by this Paul¦98870 fellow, and now the crowds¦98878 are saying¦98879 that what we make are not \add real\add* gods¦98884.
\v 27 However it's not only us and our trade¦98899 that is coming into disrepute¦98903, but the temple¦98913 of the great goddess¦98910 Artemis is considered to be useless. This could result in a loss of power for the great Artemas that all of Asia \add Minor\add* and the inhabited¦98938 world¦98938 have been worshipping¦98939.”
\p
\v 28 When the gathering heard¦98941 this, they¦98952 became very angry and¦98944 yelled out, “Artemis¦98956 of the Ephesians is great!”
\v 29 Then the \add whole\add* city¦98963 was filled¦98959 with confusion¦98966 and the people rushed¦98968 to the theatre¦98974 and grabbed Gaius¦98977 and Aristarchus¦98979 from Macedonia¦98980—travelling¦98982 companions¦98982 of Paul's.
\v 30 Now Paul¦98986 wanted to go there and speak to the crowd, but the believers wouldn't let him¦98998 go.
\v 31 Also some of the Asian¦99006 leaders who were friendly¦99010 towards him, sent¦99011 messengers to him to implore¦99014 him not to go to the theatre¦99021.
\v 32 Some of the people gathered there were yelling out something, but overall it was just confusion, and¦99035 the majority of the people couldn't even tell you the reason why there were there.
\v 33 Some people in the crowd¦99048 selected Alexander the Jew and sent him forward¦99053 to speak, so he motioned with his hand¦99065 ready to explain the situation to the people.
\v 34 But as soon as they recognised¦99072 that he was a Jew¦99076, people started yelling, “Artemis¦99092 of the Ephesians is great,” and this continued for over two¦99087 hours¦99086.
\p
\v 35 Eventually the city¦99123 administrator was able to calm the crowd¦99104 and tell them, “Men, fellow Ephesians, what person from around here doesn't know that it's Ephesus¦99110 that's the temple¦99124 keeper¦99124 of the great¦99129 Artemus¦99131 and of this image¦99134 that fell down from Zeus.
\v 36 Since all of this is unquestionable¦99135, it¦99141 makes sense for everyone to calm down and¦99145 not do anything reckless¦99147.
\v 37 These men¦99153 that you¦99150 presented here haven't stolen anything from the temple¦99158, nor have they slandered¦99161 our¦99165 goddess¦99163.
\v 38 So if Demetrius¦99170 and the silver craftmen¦99178 with him¦99177 have a case against anyone¦99182,, they should bring it to the courts¦99185 and the proconsuls¦99188 and register the charges.
\v 39 But for the rest of you, if you have a grievance against others¦99193, it¦99208 needs to be settled¦99208 in a lawful¦99205 assembly¦99207,
\v 40 because we're in danger¦99211 of being charged with insurrection¦99214 about what happened today¦99217. And we would have no defence that we could respond with concerning this disorderly¦99232 gathering¦99232.” Then he told them all to go home.
\c 20
\s1 Paul travels to Macedonia and Achaia
\p
\v 1 After all the commotion¦99245 had died down, Paul¦99249 sent¦99246 for the believers, and after¦99240 greeting¦99257 and encouraging them, he left¦99259 \add Ephesus\add* to go to Macedonia¦99264.\f + \fr 20:1 \ft As he'd already decided—see 19:21.\f*
\v 2 As he travelled through¦99265 the districts¦99269, he challenged the people there with a lot of messages, until he eventually arrived in Greece.
\v 3 He'd been there about three¦99286 months¦99285 when he heard about a plot by some Jews¦99295 to waylay him as he boarded a ship to return to Syria, so instead he decided to return through¦99313 Macedonia¦99315
\v 4 with Sopater son of Pyrrhus¦99328 from Berea, Aristarchus¦99332 and Secundus from Thessalonica¦99330, Gaius¦99336 from Derbe, Tychicus and Trophimus from the province of Asia, and Timothy¦99340 all accompanying¦99316 him¦99321.
\v 5 They went ahead and waited for us\f + \fr 20:5 \ft Luke (the writer) includes himself here.\f* at Troas.
\v 6 So we sailed¦99359 out from Philippi after the Feast of Flat Bread. We arrived and meet the others there at Troas after a five-day trip, and then stayed¦99384 on there for seven¦99386 days.
\s1 Paul's all-night discussions in Troas
\p
\v 7 On the Sunday we had gathered¦99395 together to break¦99400 bread¦99401 together and Paul¦99403 was discussing¦99404 many things with them. As he was scheduled to leave the next day, the meeting went on towards midnight¦99415
\v 8 and there¦99416 were many lamps¦99419 in the upper¦99423 room where¦99424 we¦99425 had all gathered¦99427.
\v 9 Now there was a young¦99432 man¦99432 named Eutychus who was sitting¦99428 on the window¦99438 sill, and as Paul¦99447 went on, he fell asleep and toppled down from the third¦99458 storey. The ones who reached him first thought he was dead¦99463,
\v 10 but Paul¦99467 had come¦99464 downstairs and bent over Eutychus and held him in his¦99483 arms and said¦99477 to the crowd, “Don't worry, he's still alive.”
\v 11 Then Paul went back up and broke¦99490 the bread¦99492 with the others, eating a little and continuing to talk with them until¦99500 leaving at daybreak¦99501.
\v 12 The locals took the young man home and¦99514 were very relieved that he¦99510 was alive.
\s1 Sailing from Troas to Miletus
\p
\v 13 We went ahead to the ship¦99526 and departed for Assos¦99531 where it had been arranged that we'd pick up Paul¦99536 because¦99538 he wanted to walk there¦99532.
\v 14 So when we met him¦99559 at Assos¦99557, he¦99550 boarded the ship and we all sailed on to Mitylene.
\v 15 After we left Mitylene, we were out from Kios the next day, in Samos¦99577 the day after that, and then the following day we arrived at Miletus.
\v 16 Paul¦99593 had decided to sail¦99594 past Ephesus¦99596 because¦99610 he was hurrying¦99609 to try to get the Jerusalem¦99624 for the Day of Pentecost so he didn't want to spend¦99603 time¦99603 in Asia Minor.
\s1 Paul's farewell to the Ephesian elders
\p
\v 17 So while we were at Miletus, he sent¦99630 a message to Ephesus¦99632 for the elders¦99636 of the assembly¦99638 to come to him.
\v 18 When they arrived¦99641, he told them, “You all know that from the very first¦99657 day¦99658 that I set foot¦99662 in Asia and for the entire¦99653 time¦99679 that I was there
\v 19 I humbly served the master¦99684 even through tears¦99692 and trials¦99694 when the Jews¦99703 plotted to destroy me.
\v 20 But I didn't shrink back from teaching you everything that would help you, whether I was teaching in public¦99717 or in individual homes¦99720.
\v 21 I explained to both Jews¦99725 and Greeks how they needed to turn their backs on their sins and towards God¦99732 with faith¦99735 in our¦99743 master¦99741 Yeshua¦99744 the messiah¦99746.
\p
\v 22 However the spirit¦99755 is now forcing me towards Jerusalem¦99758 even though I don't¦99768 know what will happen to me there.
\v 23 I just know that recently in every¦99778 city¦99780, the pure¦99776 spirit¦99774 tells me that chains and¦99789 hardships are waiting for me.
\v 24 But I've never regarded my own life as being valuable—I only want to reach the end of my life having served in the way that the master¦99834 Yeshua¦99835 instructed me to speak out the good message¦99841 about God's grace¦99843.
\p
\v 25 So you see, I know that all of you from here where I passed¦99864 through¦99864 proclaiming¦99865 God's kingdom¦99867, you will never see me again.
\v 26 That's why I'm declaring to all of you¦99876 today¦99880 that I'm not guilty of your judgement
\v 27 because¦99892 I didn't avoid telling you¦99904 anything that I had from God¦99902.
\v 28 So now you elders look after your own lives and those of your flock¦99912 because the pure¦99919 spirit¦99917 chose you as overseers¦99922 to shepherd¦99923 the assembly¦99925 of God's people who he paid for with his very own blood¦99936.
\v 29 I'm aware that after¦99946 I leave, vicious wolves¦99951 will come in amongst¦99953 you¦99954 and trying to steal the flock¦99958.
\v 30 Even some of you¦99961 will rise up and¦99959 teach a message that's warped but which will draw some of the believers away to follow it,
\v 31 so take great care. Remember that for three¦99979 years, I never stopped warning each of you along with my tears¦99988
\v 32 so now I am leaving you all in God's hands and with the message¦100005 of his¦100008 grace¦100007 which is quite capable of helping you grow to receive the inheritance¦100018 that's for all those who've been purified.
\p
\v 33 I never envied anyone's gold¦100030 or silver¦100027 or \add fancy\add* clothes¦100032
\v 34 and you¦100038 yourselves¦100036 know that I laboured with my own hands¦100054 to cover my expenses and for those with me.
\v 35 Yes, I showed¦100060 you all that it's good to work and to take care of the weaker ones and to remember¦100070 the message¦100073 of the master¦100075 Yeshua¦100076 when he said¦100080 that it's better to be a giver than a taker.”
\p
\v 36 When he'd finished speaking, Paul knelt¦100093 down and prayed¦100100 with them all.
\v 37 Everyone¦100115 was sobbing as they¦100116 hugged and¦100109 kissed him¦100115
\v 38 because¦100120 what he had said about never seeing him again had really distressed¦100118 them. Then they accompanied¦100136 him to his¦100134 ship¦100142.
\c 21
\s1 Paul goes to Jerusalem
\p
\v 1 When it¦100146 was time for us to sail, we¦100162 left them and sailed directly across to Cos before going on to Rhodes the next day¦100167 and then on to Patara¦100176.
\v 2 From there we found¦100180 a ship¦100181 heading to Phoenicia, so we boarded¦100185 that and set off.
\v 3 After sighting Cyprus and then leaving it¦100194 behind on our left, we sailed on to Syria and docked there¦100204 at the port of Tyre¦100203 where the ship¦100208 had cargo¦100212 to be unloaded¦100210.
\v 4 We searched for the believers there¦100220 and then stayed on with them for seven¦100222 days¦100221. They were inspired by the spirit¦100230 to tell Paul¦100225 not to go to Jerusalem¦100237.
\v 5 Once our time was up there and everyone knew that we¦100247 were leaving, even the wives¦100252 and children¦100254 accompanied¦100248 us out of the city¦100258 to the port. We all knelt¦100260 on the beach and prayed¦100268
\v 6 before we continued on and boarded our ship¦100280 and they went¦100276 back to their¦100285 own homes¦100286.
\p
\v 7 So we sailed from Tyre¦100293 down to Ptolemais¦100297 where we were able to greet¦100300 the brothers¦100302 and sisters¦100302 and stay overnight with them.
\v 8 The next day¦100309 we continued on to Caesarea¦100321 and ended up in Philip's house¦100326. He was one of the \add original\add* seven¦100334 \add men who had been given the responsibility of distributing aid\add*—a preacher¦100329 of the good¦100329 message¦100329, and we stayed with him¦100337.
\v 9 Philip had four¦100344 unmmarried daughters¦100342 still at home, and they shared messages from God.
\v 10 Several days¦100351 later a man named Agabus came¦100353 from Judea¦100357. He too shared messages from God
\v 11 and when he arrived, he picked up Paul's belt and tied it around his own feet and hands, telling them that the pure¦100392 spirit¦100390 had told him that this is how the owner of the belt would be treated by the Jewish leaders in Jerusalem¦100404 before they would then hand him over to the non-Jews¦100414 to be dealt with.
\p
\v 12 When we heard¦100417 this described, both we and the locals¦100425 begged Paul not to go to Jerusalem¦100434
\v 13 but he answered¦100436, “Oh come on, what's all this weeping¦100448 and carrying on that's breaking¦100451 my¦100452 heart¦100454. Actually I'm quite ready¦100467 not only to be tied up, but even to be killed in Jerusalem¦100466 as a testimony to the master¦100475 Yeshua¦100476.”
\p
\v 14 When we saw that we couldn't change his mind, we didn't say anything else, figuring out that whatever the master¦100488 wills for the situation would happen,
\v 15 and so after¦100496 these¦100501 several days¦100500, we¦100507 had gotten everything ready and started off for Jerusalem¦100511.
\v 16 Some of the believers from Caesarea¦100519 accompanied us and led us to the home of a man named Mnason to stay—he¦100515 was an older believer from Cyprus.
\s1 Paul visits Jacob and makes a vow
\p
\v 17 When we arrived at Jerusalem¦100537, the brothers¦100543 and¦100543 sisters¦100543 there happily welcomed¦100539 us,
\v 18 and the next day¦100544, we accompanied Paul¦100553 to go and see Jacob\f + \fr 21:18 \ft Jacob is commonly (but wrongly) called James in most older English Bibles.\f* and the elders¦100562 of the assembly there.
\v 19 After greeting¦100566 them, Paul then described all the things that God¦100582 had done among the non-Jews¦100585 as he had served among them,
\v 20 and when they'd heard¦100592 all that they praised¦100593 God¦100596 and told Paul, “Brother, you've noticed how many thousands¦100606 of Jews¦100611 have believed¦100615 \add in the messiah\add* but they still strive to observe¦100603 the \add Moses'\add* laws.
\v 21 But they've heard reports that you've been teaching¦100629 the Jews¦100638 that live outside our country that they don't have to obey what Moses \add wrote\add*—telling them that they don't have to have their¦100645 children¦100646 circumcised¦100643 and that they don't have to follow our \add Jewish\add* customs¦100651.
\v 22 What will happen \add now\add*, because \add the leaders here\add* will certainly hear¦100663 that you¦100666 have arrived?
\v 23 So here's what we¦100672 suggest that you¦100671 do: Four of our¦100676 men are making a \add public\add* vow.
\v 24 Why don't you join these¦100682 four and join them in the purification¦100684 ceremony \add at the temple\add* and pay their expenses in getting your heads shaved. Then everyone will be able to see that it's false what they've heard about¦100708 you, because¦100690 you \add clearly\add* still comply with \add Moses'\add* instructions¦100707.
\v 25 And as for the believers¦100727 who are non-Jews¦100728, we've informed them of our recommendation that they should avoid anything that's been offered to an idol¦100753, avoid consuming blood¦100756 and meat from strangled¦100758 animals¦100758 and birds, and avoid sexual¦100760 immorality¦100760.”
\p
\v 26 So the next day¦100770 Paul¦100763 took the \add four\add* men¦100766 for the purification¦100773 ceremony in the temple¦100778 and there they announced¦100779 the date when their vows would be fulfilled¦100781 and their sacrifices made.
\s1 Paul is captured inside the temple
\p
\v 27 When the seven¦100802 days¦100804 \add of the vow\add* were almost over, some Jews¦100813 from \add the province of\add* Asia \add Minor\add* noticed Paul in the temple¦100819. They stirred up the crowd¦100829 and grabbed hold of him,
\v 28 yelling out, “Men of Israel. Help us here. This is the man¦100849 who's been teaching¦100867 all around the world against Israel and against \add Moses'\add* law and against this temple. What's more he brought¦100872 non-Jews here into the temple and so has defiled¦100879 this holy place.”
\v 29 (\add They said this\add* because they had previously¦100887 seen¦100887 Trophimus from Ephesus¦100890 in the city¦100893 with Paul¦100905 and had assumed that he had brought¦100903 him into the temple¦100902.)
\p
\v 30 So now the whole¦100910 city¦100909 was in an uproar, and the crowds rushed in, grabbed Paul¦100919, and dragged¦100920 him¦100921 out of the temple and hurriedly closed the temple gates.
\v 31 They were ready to kill¦100937 Paul, but the commander¦100941 of the Roman soldiers had heard that all Jerusalem¦100948 was in an uproar.
\v 32 Taking some soldiers and officers, he immediately¦100950 ran down to the temple, and when the crowd saw the commander¦100964 and the soldiers they stopped beating Paul¦100972.
\v 33 The commander¦100977 came close and took¦100978 hold of Paul and ordered that he be tied up with a pair of chains¦100983 while he tried to find out who he was and what he'd done wrong.
\v 34 Various people in the crowd¦101004 were shouting out different things, and not being able to make any sense of it because¦101014 of all the commotion¦101016, the commander¦101017 ordered that Paul be taken into the barracks¦101022.
\v 35 When they got to the stairs¦101029, the soldiers¦101037 had to lift him¦101034 up above their heads because¦101038 of the frenzy of the crowd¦101043,
\v 36 because most of the people¦101049 were following¦101044 and shouting out, “Do away with him¦101054!”
\s1 Paul's defence
\p
\v 37 As they were able to carry him into the fortress, Paul¦101062 called down to the commander, “Can I say¦101072 something¦101073 to you¦101075?”
\p “You speak Greek!”, replied the commander.
\v 38 “Aren't you¦101083 the Egyptian who stirred up a group of assassins¦101102 a while back and led them out into the wilderness¦101097?”
\p
\v 39 “No, I'm a Jew from Tarsus¦101114 in Cilica—a citizen¦101122 of an important city¦101121,” said¦101103 Paul¦101106. “But please, let me speak¦101130 to these people¦101133.”
\p
\v 40 The commander nodded, so the soldiers stood¦101143 Paul on the stairs¦101146 where he gestured¦101149 to the people¦101154. The crowd quietened down, and so Paul spoke loudly in his¦101135 Hebrew language¦101168:
\c 22
\nb
\v 1 “Men, brothers¦101171 and¦101172 fathers¦101173, listen to what I have to say for myself.”
\v 2 When they heard¦101182 him speaking Hebrew, they became even more quiet¦101193 as he continued,
\v 3 “I am a Jew who grew up in this very city¦101215 to study under Gamaliel¦101220. I've been raised according¦101224 to every part of our¦101226 ancestral¦101227 law, working hard to obey God¦101232 like all of you¦101236 here today¦101239.
\v 4 I used to persecute¦101245 the followers of ‘The Path’ even to death¦101248—tying up both men and women¦101258 and handing them over to the prisons¦101253
\v 5 as the Chief Priest and akk the council¦101272 of elders¦101272 will attest. I took letters¦101276 from them to our \add Jewish\add* brothers¦101282 in Damascus¦101285 when I went so that I could tie up the ones there¦101291 and bring¦101287 them back here to Jerusalem¦101296 to be punished¦101299.
\s1 Paul explains about his conversion
\r (Acts 9:1-19; 26:12-18)
\p
\v 6 “But one time as I was travelling and¦101305 getting close to Damascus¦101308 by the middle of the day¦101310, suddenly¦101313 a bright light¦101321 from the sky¦101317 began to flash¦101318 around me
\v 7 and¦101332 I fell to the ground¦101331. I heard¦101333 a voice¦101334 asking me, ‘Saul, Saul, why are you¦101343 persecuting¦101343 me?’
\v 8 ‘Who are you, master¦101351?’ I answered¦101346. And the voice said¦101352, ‘I am Yeshua¦101361—the one from Nazareth¦101363 that you are persecuting¦101366.’
\v 9 The other¦101381 people with me saw¦101375 the light¦101374 but didn't hear the voice¦101382 that spoke to me.
\v 10 Then I asked, ‘What do I need to do, master?’ ‘Get up and continue into Damascus¦101403,’ the master said. ‘When you get there¦101404, you'll be told everything that you've been assigned to do.’
\v 11 But I couldn't see anything because¦101420 the brightness of the light¦101424 \add had affected my eyes\add*, so my companions had to lead me by hand¦101426 into Damascus¦101434.
\p
\v 12 “In Damascus there was a \add non-Jew\add* named Ananias¦101435 who was respected by the Jews¦101450 there because he strove to obey Moses' instructions about living¦101449.
\v 13 Ananias came to where I was and standing by me said¦101457, “Brother Saul¦101459, receive¦101461 your sight¦101461?” That very hour¦101465 I was able to see again and look at him¦101469
\v 14 and he said¦101472, ‘The god¦101474 of our¦101477 ancestors¦101476 decided in advance to reveal his¦101484 plans to you, and for you to see¦101486 the sinless one to hear¦101490 him speaking
\v 15 because¦101499 he wants you to inform people¦101502 everywhere what you've seen¦101505 and heard¦101507.
\v 16 So what else are you waiting¦101511 for? Get up and wash away your¦101518 sins¦101517 by getting immersed¦101513 \add in water\add* as you request his¦101524 forgiveness.’
\s1 The crowd riots when Paul mentions preaching to non-Jews
\p
\v 17 “Then when I returned¦101528 to Jerusalem¦101530 and¦101531 was praying¦101532 in the temple¦101536, I fell into a trance¦101540
\v 18 and saw \add the master\add* telling me, ‘Get out of Jerusalem¦101553 in a hurry because¦101554 they¦101556 won't accept¦101556 what you're teaching them about me.’
\v 19 ‘Master¦101564,’ I replied, ‘they¦101565 know that previously I was the one imprisoning¦101570 and¦101571 beating¦101572 the people who believed¦101577 in you¦101579.
\v 20 And when Stephen was killed after telling about you¦101589, it was me standing there and cheering on the ones executing him¦101606 as I held their cloaks for them.’
\v 21 Then \add the master\add* told me, ‘Get going¦101612 now because¦101613 I'm sending¦101619 you¦101621 away to the non-Jews¦101616.’ ”
\p
\v 22 Until this point in his message¦101629, the crowd had been listening to Paul, but now they started shouting, “Do away with this man¦101641! He doesn't deserve to live in this world!”
\v 23 Then they yelled and threw some of their¦101655 clothes¦101656 down onto the ground and threw dust up into the air.
\v 24 So the commander¦101667 ordered Paul to be brought¦101668 inside into barracks¦101673 and ordered that he be flogged¦101676 and interrogated¦101677 to determine what he had done that would make the crowd react like thaat.
\v 25 But as they strapped¦101700 him up and stretched¦101695 him out for the flogging¦101719, Paul¦101708 asked the centurion¦101705 standing there, “It is legal for you to flog a Roman citizen who hasn't had a trial?”
\p
\v 26 When he heard¦101721 that, the centurion¦101724 went to the commander¦101733 and reported¦101735, “How are we going¦101740 to handle this, because this man¦101744 is a Roman citizen?”
\p
\v 27 So the commander¦101752 went in to where Paul was and asked him¦101755, “Tell me the truth. Are you¦101760 a Roman citizen?”
\p “Yes I am,” said¦101754 Paul.
\p
\v 28 “Yeah, and¦101772 I paid a lot for mine as well,” mocked the commander¦101775.
\p “Actually mine is through birth,” Paul¦101790 responded.
\p
\v 29 At this point, the soliders who were about to interrogate¦101806 Paul left the room, and even the commander¦101809 was now afraid¦101811 after learning¦101812 that he had had a Roman citizen tied down to be flogged.
\s1 Paul faces the Jewish council
\p
\v 30 The next day¦101822, the Romman commander¦101842 still wanted to know¦101826 what was behind the anger of the Jews¦101835, so he had Paul released¦101836 from the cell, but brought¦101854 him down to a room where he had ordered the chief¦101846 priests¦101846 and the Jewish council¦101851 to convene. Paul was given a seat
\c 23
\nb
\v 1 and looking directly at the council¦101865 members said¦101868, “Men, brothers¦101870, all my life I have lived¦101875 before God¦101877 as a good¦101874 citizen¦101875 and with a clean conscience¦101873.”
\v 2 But Ananias¦101885 the chief¦101884 priest¦101884 commanded¦101887 one of his¦101892 companions to whack Paul on the mouth¦101894.
\v 3 “God¦101908 will strike¦101904 you,” said¦101903 Paul¦101897, “you grand show-off. You've been brought here to judge me as someone who knows the law and yet you violate¦101920 the law by commanding¦101921 that I be hit in the face.”
\p
\v 4 But the others standing there said¦101927, “Are you¦101933 insulting¦101933 God's chief¦101930 priest¦101930?”
\p
\v 5 “Brothers¦101940,” said Paul¦101937, “I didn't realise that he's the chief¦101943 priest¦101943, because¦101945 the scriptures teach us not to speak¦101952 wrongly¦101953 of our leaders.”
\p
\v 6 But then, knowing¦101954 that the council¦101972 consisted of some from the sect of the Sadducees¦101963 and some from the Pharisees' party, Paul¦101957 continued loudly, “Men, brothers¦101974, like my father, I'm a member¦101976 of the Pharisees and I'm being¦101987 tried today concerning¦101981 the hope and the resurrection¦101984 of the dead¦101985!”
\p
\v 7 Well, as soon as he said this, the council was split as the Pharisees and the Sadducees¦102004 started arguing.
\v 8 (Sadducees¦102010 say that the dead don't come back to life, and there's no angels¦102019 and no spirits¦102021, but the Pharisees believe there is.)
\v 9 So then there was a big kerfuffle because some of the teachers¦102037 of the law spoke up for the Pharisees saying¦102046, “We don't see anything wrong with this man¦102052. Maybe it was a spirit¦102056 or an angel¦102060 that spoke to him.”
\p
\v 10 But the \add Roman\add* commander¦102074 was afraid¦102071 that they might tear Paul apart¦102076 in the big argument, so he called for his soldiers to come¦102086 down to uplift Paul and return him to the barracks¦102098.
\p
\v 11 The following¦102101 night¦102102, the master¦102106 appeared to Paul and told him¦102104, “Be brave because¦102111 just like you testified¦102112 about me here in Jerusalem¦102118, so too you'll tell them about me in Rome.”
\s1 The plan to kill Paul
\p
\v 12 The next day¦102129, some of the Jews¦102139 gathered¦102133 informally and pledged not to eat¦102146 or drink¦102148 until¦102150 they'd killed Paul¦102158.
\v 13 There were more than forty¦102162 of them in this conspiracy¦102168,
\v 14 and they approached¦102172 the chief¦102174 priests¦102174 and elders¦102177 and told them, “We've made an oath to taste¦102184 nothing¦102183 until¦102187 we've killed Paul¦102192, otherwise we'll bring a curse¦102180 on ourselves¦102182.
\v 15 So you guys assemble the council¦102209 and report¦102204 to the commander¦102206 so that he'll bring¦102213 him down to you all as if you need more information about his actions, and then we'll have an opportunity to kill¦102237 before¦102229 he gets here.
\p
\v 16 But a nephew of Paul had heard¦102243 about this ambush¦102252 and¦102255 went in to the barracks¦102260 to inform Paul.
\v 17 Paul¦102267 then called¦102264 one of the Roman centurions¦102270 and told him to take the young¦102274 man¦102274 to the commander¦102280 because¦102282 he had something¦102285 to tell him.
\v 18 So the centurion took him to the commander¦102295, explaining, “The prisoner¦102299 Paul¦102300, called¦102301 me and asked¦102303 me to bring this young¦102306 man¦102306 to you because he has something¦102312 to report to you.”
\p
\v 19 The commander¦102322 took the young man by the hand¦102319 and led him¦102320 into his¦102320 private office and asked, “What do you¦102332 have to tell me?”
\p
\v 20 “The Jews¦102339 have decided¦102340 to ask¦102342 you,”, he said¦102335, “that tomorrow¦102345 you bring¦102348 Paul¦102347 down to the council¦102351 as if they wanted to question him further.
\v 21 But don't¦102367 listen to them because¦102371 over forty¦102377 of their¦102373 men¦102375 will be lying¦102370 in wait for him, and they have sworn not to eat¦102382 or drink¦102384 until¦102386 they've killed him. In fact, they're all set up already, just waiting¦102396 for your consent.”
\p
\v 22 The commander¦102404 told the young¦102407 man¦102407 not to tell anyone else about the ambush and dismissed him.
\s1 Paul is escorted away in the night
\p
\v 23 Then the commander called¦102419 in two of his centurions¦102424 and ordered them to prepare two-hundred soldiers to travel as far as Caesarea¦102432, supported by seventy¦102435 mounted soldiers and two-hundred more with spears¦102437. They were to be ready to leave by 9pm,
\v 24 along with a horse for Paul¦102451 to ride, and were to get him¦102452 safely¦102452 to Governor Felix.
\v 25 Then the commander wrote a leeter ready to take:
\p
\v 26 “Greetings to the most excellent¦102489 Governor Felix from Claudius Lysias.
\v 27 I'm writing to you about this man¦102494 who had been captured¦102499 by the Jews¦102502 here and they were about to kill him when I moved in with my soldiers because he is a Roman citizen.
\v 28 I wanted to know¦102528 what they were accusing him of, so I took him down to their¦102542 council¦102541 meeting,
\v 29 but¦102554 I discovered that it was just some detail about their¦102552 \add Jewish\add* law and nothing¦102553 that should result in death¦102556 or imprisonment.
\v 30 Then when I learnt that they have a plot to try to ambush and kill him, I sent¦102577 him immediately¦102574 to you, and I'll order his accusers¦102583 to bring their case before¦102589 you.”
\p
\v 31 So the soldiers¦102595 carried out their instructions and took Paul¦102602 as far as Antipatris¦102609 during the night¦102606.
\v 32 The next morning the foot soldiers returned¦102621 to the barracks¦102624, leaving the mounted soldiers to take him¦102619 on
\v 33 to Caesarea¦102629, where they¦102636 presented¦102636 Paul¦102639 to the governor¦102635 along with the letter¦102633.
\v 34 After reading the letter the governor asked¦102646 Paul what province¦102650 that he's from and found out that he was from Cilicia.
\v 35 Then he ordered Paul to be kept under guard¦102681 \add in the prison\add* in Herod's¦102680 palace until he would hear¦102661 from him in the future once his accusers¦102667 got there.
\c 24
\s1 The Jews accuse Paul before Felix
\p
\v 1 Five days¦102687 later, Ananias¦102691 the chief¦102690 priest¦102690 arrived along with some elders¦102694 and¦102696 an attorney¦102697 named Tertullus¦102698, to bring before the governor¦102703 the charges against¦102704 Paul¦102706.
\v 2 Once he¦102721 was called¦102707 to speak, Tertullus¦102713 began¦102710 his¦102709 accusation¦102711 of Paul:
\p “We have seen peace¦102716 under your rule and the helpful reforms¦102721 that this nation¦102725 has experienced through your provision¦102730,
\v 3 most excellent¦102736 Felix¦102737, and we¦102735 gratefully welcome¦102735 everything you've done and everywhere you've done it¦102735.
\v 4 But in order¦102741 not to oblige you longer than necessary, in your gentleness¦102756 we request you to listen to our brief¦102753 statement.
\v 5 This man¦102760 here has been found¦102757 to be a trouble-maker, stirring¦102765 up riots among the Jews¦102770 throughout the inhabited¦102774 world¦102774, and as a ring-leader of the Nazarite sect
\v 6 he¦102783 even attempted¦102785 to profane¦102786 the temple¦102784 where we¦102789 were able to arrest him.
\v 7 ≈
\v 8 When you examine¦102821 him yourself¦102820 you'll discover all these¦102824 things that we're accusing¦102828 him of.”
\v 9 The Jews¦102835 who had come also affirmed all the accusations.
\s1 Paul's defence against the accusations
\p
\v 10 So the governor¦102848 nodded¦102845 for Paul¦102844 to speak¦102849 and he started,
\p “I happily defend¦102865 myself¦102864 today knowing that you have many years¦102852 of experience ruling \add in this region\add*.
\v 11 You can quickly establish that it was less than twelve¦102877 days¦102875 ago that I arrived in Jerusalem¦102885 to worship there¦102873.
\v 12 They never found¦102892 me in the temple¦102891 arguing with anyone¦102895 or stirring up the crowd¦102901, and nor was I doing that in the Jewish¦102905 meeting¦102905 halls¦102905 or anywhere in the city¦102909
\v 13 and so they can't provide evidence to you¦102915 to support any of their accusations¦102921.
\v 14 However, I must confess¦102923 that I follow ‘The Path’ that they¦102932 call a sect which¦102931 serves the God¦102938 of our ancestors¦102937 and¦102945 believes¦102939 everything in \add Moses'\add* law as well as the writings of the prophets¦102949.
\v 15 We put our trust in the same God that they themselves¦102959 follow, and we all anticipate a resurrection¦102962 of those who serve God and those who don't.
\v 16 Because of this, I also strive to maintain a clean conscience¦102977 in everything¦102987, before God¦102982 and¦102983 the people¦102985.
\p
\v 17 After several years¦102989 away, I arrived¦102999 \add in Jerusalem\add* bringing offerings¦103001 to help my¦102998 own people and¦103000 before God.
\v 18 That was when they¦103005 found¦103005 me in the temple¦103010 after going through the purification¦103007 ceremony, and without either a crowd¦103013 or a commotion¦103016 around me.
\v 19 But there were some Jews¦103023 from Asia Minor who are the ones who should be appearing here before¦103027 you¦103028, and¦103030 they should be the ones accusing¦103031 me if they could find anything¦103033 against¦103035 me.
\v 20 Even these¦103041 ones here now should explain what their council¦103053 found¦103045 me guilty of,
\v 21 other than my calling out that I was being¦103071 judged¦103071 because I believe in the resurrection¦103068 of the dead¦103069.
\p
\v 22 But Felix who was already familiar with followers of ‘The Path’, announced that the trial would be adjourned until Commander Lysias arrived when he would investigate¦103098 further.
\v 23 He ordered the centurion¦103106 to keep Paul confined but under relaxed¦103113 conditions and allowing any of his¦103119 friends to bring him anything he¦103104 needed.
\s1 Paul speaks to the governor and his wife
\p
\v 24 However, several days¦103126 later Felix arrived¦103129 there with his wife¦103136 Drusilla who was Jewish. He sent¦103141 for Paul¦103143 and¦103144 listened to him¦103146 explain about faith¦103153 in the messiah¦103150.
\v 25 But when the subject turned to righteousness¦103158 and self-control¦103161 and the coming¦103167 judgement, Felix became very uncomfortable and told him, “That's enough for now. If I have time in the future, I'll send for you.”
\v 26 However he was also hoping¦103189 that Paul¦103196 would give him money¦103191, so he often sent for him and spoke with him.
\p
\v 27 This went on for two¦103208 years¦103208, until Felix was replaced as governor by Porcius Festus, but wanting¦103217 to stay in the good books of the Jews¦103223, Felix left Paul¦103229 confined.
\c 25
\s1 Tried yet again, Paul appeals to Caesar
\p
\v 1 After Festus had been in the area for three¦103238 days¦103239, he¦103234 made the uphill trip from Caesarea¦103244 to Jerusalem¦103242.
\v 2 There the chief¦103252 priests¦103252 nad Jewish leaders¦103255 repeated their case against¦103258 Paul¦103260, and they implored¦103262 him,
\v 3 asking as a special favour¦103265, that he would order Paul to be sent to Jerusalem¦103274 (so they could ambush¦103275 and kill¦103277 him on the way¦103281).
\v 4 But Festus replied that he'd keep Paul¦103289 in Caesarea¦103292 and¦103295 he was heading back there soon,
\v 5 so he told them, “Some of your leaders can go there with me, and if the man¦103316 has done anything¦103311 wrong, they can bring their accusations¦103319 there.”
\p
\v 6 After staying seven or eight¦103330 days¦103325 in Jerusalem, Festus and company travelled downhill to Caesarea¦103335, and the next day¦103337 he sat¦103339 at the judge's bench and ordered that Paul¦103345 be brought¦103347 in.
\v 7 When he¦103353 arrived¦103348, the Jews¦103357 who had come¦103356 from Jerusalem¦103355 stood¦103351 facing Paul and¦103359 presented many heavy¦103360 charges¦103361 which¦103368 they¦103370 weren't able to prove.
\v 8 Paul¦103374 defended¦103375 himself, stating that he had not sinned¦103392 against any Jewish law or against the temple¦103387, nor against any Roman law.
\p
\v 9 However, Festus wanted to be able to grant¦103403 a favour¦103401 to the Jews¦103399, so in response to Paul¦103406 he asked, “Are you willing¦103408 to be returned to Jerusalem¦103410 so that I can judge¦103416 you about these¦103414 things¦103414 there¦103412?”
\p
\v 10 “I'm here facing Caesar's representative,” Paul¦103422 replied. “and it's quite appropriate¦103432 for me to be judged¦103433 here. I've done nothing¦103435 wrong¦103437 to these Jews¦103434 as you¦103440 can no doubt see for yourself.
\v 11 If I had done anything wrong¦103448, anything worthy¦103450 of the death sentence, then I'm ready to accept death. On the other¦103459 hand, if none of their accusations¦103464 are true, no one can hand me over to them. I appeal to Caesar.”
\p
\v 12 So the Festus conferred with his legal counsel¦103481 and answered¦103482, “Well, you've appealed¦103484 to Caesar so you'll go to Caesar!”
\s1 King Agrippa wants to hear from Paul
\p
\v 13 Several days¦103488 later, King Agrippa¦103492 and¦103495 \add his sister\add Bernice arrived¦103497 in Caesarea¦103500 to meet Festus.
\v 14 As they¦103509 were staying¦103509 on for a few days¦103508, Festus mentioned about Paul¦103520 to the king¦103515, telling him, “There's a prisoner¦103528 here that Felix left behind.
\v 15 When I was in Jerusalem¦103534, the chief¦103538 priests¦103538 and¦103539 Jewish elders¦103541 reported¦103535 to me wanting a conviction¦103547 of this man.
\v 16 I told them that it's not the Roman way to convict someone until they've been able to face¦103569 their accusers and¦103575 make their defence¦103576 against the accusations.
\v 17 So as soon as they arrived here, on the very next day¦103590 I sat¦103592 on the judge's bench and ordered the man¦103599 to be brought¦103597 in
\v 18 that they were accusing¦103604, but they didn't raise even one of the charges¦103606 that I expected.
\v 19 Instead they¦103623 raised some issues about their¦103620 own beliefs and¦103627 about some dead person called Yeshua¦103630 that Paul¦103635 reckoned was still living¦103636.
\v 20 I was puzzled about this debate¦103645 and asked him if he wanted to be judged¦103655 about these things in Jerusalem¦103653.
\v 21 But Paul¦103660 appealed¦103661 to be kept safe from them until he could face the emperor so I ordered him to be kept \add in prison\add* until I can send him to Rome.
\p
\v 22 “I'd quite like to hear him myself¦103688,” Agrippa¦103680 said.
\p “Well, tomorrow,” replied Festus, “you'll be able to hear from him.”
\p
\v 23 So the next day¦103698, \add King\add* Agrippa¦103703 and Bernice¦103706 formally arrived with all their attendants and entered the auditorium¦103715 to greet the commanders¦103719 and the prominent¦103724 men¦103721 of the city¦103727, and then Festus ordered for Paul¦103734 to be brought¦103732 in.
\v 24 Festus started, “King Agrippa¦103739 and everyone present¦103744, observe¦103747 the prisoner who a multitude¦103754 of Jews¦103756 pleaded¦103757 with me about both in Jerusalem¦103762 and here, that he doesn't deserve to still be alive.
\v 25 But I haven't discovered anything that he's done that's worthy¦103778 of a death¦103780 sentence, and since he himself¦103784 appealed¦103789 to the emperor, I judged¦103792 that that's where he should be sent.
\v 26 The problem is that I don't¦103803 have any charge to write to my master¦103802 and so I've brought¦103807 the prisoner out in front of you so that after you examine¦103819 him, I might have something¦103823 I can write,
\v 27 because it¦103829 doesn't seem logical to me to transport a prisoner¦103831 \add to Rome\add* if there's no charges¦103837 specified against¦103835 him¦103836.
\c 26
\s1 Paul's defence before Festus and Agrippa
\p
\v 1 So then Agrippa¦103839 told Paul, “Ok, you're permitted¦103845 to speak¦103850 up for yourself¦103849 now then.”
\m So Paul gestured with his hand¦103857 and¦103857 began:
\p
\v 2 “Concerning¦103859 all the charges which¦103861 have been brought against me by the Jews¦103864, King Agrippa¦103866, I consider¦103867 myself¦103868 fortunate
\v 3 because you're an expert on Jewish customs¦103891 and issues, so I ask you to listen to me patiently¦103899.
\p
\v 4 “All the Jews¦103924 know about my early life, from my upbringing in my own country and¦103919 then in Jerusalem¦103920.
\v 5 They also know, and could even testify¦103930 to you if they¦103929 would admit it, that I followed our¦103937 religious¦103938 laws very closely as a member¦103940 of the Pharisees party¦103940.
\v 6 Yet now I stand judged¦103957 for believing in the same hope as our ancestors¦103949—that hope promised¦103951 by our God¦103955
\v 7 who we twelve¦103961 tribes¦103961 diligently serve day¦103967 and¦103966 night¦103965 in order to obtain—the hope, oh king¦103982, for which I'm being¦103976 indicted¦103976.
\v 8 So why do you¦103987 all find it¦103985 unbelievable¦103984 that God¦103990 can raise the dead¦103991?
\p
\v 9 “I too \add originally\add* thought it¦104005 necessary¦104005 to do many things¦104007 to oppose the cause of this Yeshua¦104002 from Nazareth¦104004.
\v 10 So in Jerusalem¦104015 I worked to have many of these innocent believers locked¦104024 up in prison¦104023 with the authority¦104029 of the chief¦104028 priests¦104028, or if they were to be killed¦104031, I would add my vote against¦104034 them.
\v 11 And in all the Jewish¦104041 meeting¦104041 halls¦104041, \add when I found believers\add* I punished¦104043 them and forced them to curse \add God\add* and treated them with extreme anger, even travelling to further away towns.
\s1 Paul tells about his commission
\p
\v 12 So it was one time travelling to Damascus¦104064 carrying permission¦104068 letters from the chief¦104072 priests¦104072
\v 13 that in the middle¦104074 of the day¦104073, oh king¦104079, I saw¦104078 a bright light¦104089 from the sky—even brighter than the sun¦104086—and it shone¦104087 on me and my companions.
\v 14 All of us fell down to the ground¦104102 and I heard¦104103 a voice¦104104 speaking to me in Hebrew saying¦104105, “Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting¦104118 me? Life will be difficult for you if resist me.”
\v 15 “Who are you, master?” I asked.
\p And the master responded, “I am Yeshua¦104137 who you're¦104129 persecuting¦104140.
\v 16 But stand¦104144 up onto your¦104148 feet¦104147, because¦104151 I let you see me in order to appoint¦104154 you as my servant and my witness¦104159—to tell the people what you've seen and what you will be shown.
\v 17 I will rescue¦104168 you from your own people¦104172 and from the non-Jews¦104176 that I'm sending¦104182 you out to,
\v 18 to open their minds and for them to turn¦104191 back from darkness¦104193 to light¦104195 and from Satan's¦104201 power¦104199 to God¦104204, so that they can be forgiven¦104208 for their sins¦104209 and receive¦104206 an inheritance among¦104212 the ones who've been made guiltless by their faith¦104215 in me.”
\s1 Paul tells about his ministry
\p
\v 19 “So then, King Agrippa¦104221, I couldn't disobey that vision¦104227
\v 20 so I preached first¦104232 to those in Damascus¦104231 and then in Jerusalem¦104236 and all of Judea¦104244, and then in the towns of the non-Jews¦104247. I preached about turning from their sins and turning back to God¦104256, and then actually living like people who had repented¦104251.
\v 21 It was because of these¦104263 things¦104263 that the Jews¦104266 grabbed me in the temple¦104273 and¦104275 tried to do me in.
\v 22 So it is that with God's help¦104276 until¦104284 this very day¦104286 I have stood¦104288 testifying¦104289 to commoners and leaders, teaching nothing¦104295 other than what Moses and the prophets¦104301 had already written that would happen—
\v 23 that the messiah¦104310 would \add come and\add* suffer¦104308 and as the first¦104312 of the dead¦104315 to come back to life, he is going¦104317 to be proclaiming¦104319 light¦104316 to both Jews and non-Jews¦104325.”
\p
\v 24 Then speaking about Paul's defence¦104329, Governor Festus said, “Paul, you're stark, raving¦104337 mad! All your education has turned you into an idiot.”
\p
\v 25 But Paul¦104349 said, “I haven't gone mad, most excellent¦104353 Festus, but¦104355 I'm speaking¦104360 the truth¦104356 in all seriousness.
\v 26 The king knows what I'm talking¦104371 about and that's why I'm speaking boldly¦104370, because¦104373 none of these things were done in a corner¦104384 and I'm sure that none of it has escaped¦104372 his notice¦104372.
\v 27 King Agrippa¦104390, do you believe what the prophets¦104392 \add wrote\add*? Yes, I'm sure you do.
\p
\v 28 But Agrippa¦104398 answered Paul¦104401, “Do you think you can talk me into becoming a follower¦104408 of the messiah¦104408 in just that short time¦104404?”
\p
\v 29 “I hope to God¦104419”, said Paul¦104413, “whether it takes a short time or a long time, that both you and the others listening today¦104436 will become¦104437 just like me except¦104444 for these¦104447 chains.”
\p
\v 30 Then the king¦104455 and the governor¦104458 both stood, along with Bernice¦104461 and the others sitting¦104464 with them
\v 31 and as they left they were saying¦104471 to each other, “That man¦104483 hasn't done anything deserving of death¦104475 or imprisonment.”
\v 32 “Yes, he could have been set free,” replied Agrippa¦104485, “if he hadn't appealed¦104497 to Caesar.”
\c 27
\s1 Paul is escorted off overseas
\p
\v 1 So when it¦104501 was considered the right season to sail to Italy, Paul¦104512 and¦104513 some other¦104515 prisoners¦104516 were put under the guard of a centurion¦104517 named Julius (from the Augustan¦104522 Regiment).
\v 2 We all boarded¦104523 on a ship¦104525 from Adramyttium¦104526 that was about to sail to various places¦104536 along¦104533 the coast of Asia \add Minor\add*. Aristarchus¦104541, a Macedonian man from Thessalonica¦104544, was with us as we¦104537 departed.
\p
\v 3 The next day¦104547 we¦104548 docked at Sidon¦104550 where Julius very kindly allowed Paul¦104557 to visit some of his friends¦104562 so they could provide for his needs.
\v 4 When we¦104569 left again, the ship stayed between Cyprus and the mainland because¦104572 of the unfavourable winds¦104575,
\v 5 then after sailing past Cilicia and¦104585 Pamphylia, we¦104588 docked at Myra in \add the province\add* of Lycia.
\v 6 There the centurion¦104600 found¦104598 a ship¦104602 from Alexandria¦104603 that was sailing¦104604 to Italy, so he boarded us on that.
\p
\v 7 After many days¦104616 of slow and difficult¦104619 sailing¦104617, we came alongside Cnidus but the wind¦104628 wasn't helpful to us, so we sailed¦104629 across to Crete and along the cape of Salmone.
\v 8 We sailed along¦104636 it¦104637 with difficulty¦104634 until we¦104638 came¦104638 to a place¦104640 called¦104642 ‘Fair Havens’ which¦104645 was near the city¦104648 of Lasea.
\p
\v 9 A lot of time¦104654 had now elapsed¦104655 and¦104656 the voyage¦104661 was starting to become dangerous¦104659 because¦104662 we were already heading into winter. Paul¦104671 advised¦104669 those in charge,
\v 10 telling them, “Men, I perceive¦104675 that we're going to encounter a lot of damage¦104678 on this voyage¦104698, with loss not only of the cargo¦104686 and the ship¦104689, but also our¦104694 lives¦104693.”
\v 11 But the centurion¦104701 was persuaded¦104710 by the ship¦104707 owner¦104707 and¦104705 the captain¦104704, rather¦104709 than by what Paul¦104715 had said.
\v 12 They realised that this harbour wasn't suitable to winter in, so the majority suggested leaving there¦104730 with the expectation of being¦104721 able to get to Crete to the winter in the harbour at Phoenix (which was open to both the southwest¦104745 and¦104746 the northwest¦104748).
\s1 The severe storm at sea
\p
\v 13 When a south¦104752 wind¦104752 started blowing gently¦104749, they thought they could make it, so they pulled in the anchor and sailed along¦104759 close to Crete.
\v 14 However¦104774, a short while later the wind¦104770 turned to a violent north-easter which forced us out to sea.
\v 15 The ship¦104779 was driven by the wind¦104785 and unable to tack to face into it, so the sailors gave¦104786 up and just let it be driven.
\v 16 As we passed a small island¦104788 called¦104792 Clauda, we got a brief break and were able to resecure the lifeboat¦104802
\v 17 and then bring it up onboard. Then ropes were used to wrap around the ship in case it were to run aground¦104817 into the shallows¦104815 at Syrtis and the gear was lowered¦104818,\f + \fr 27:17 \ft It's not certain what was meant here—it might have meant lowering the sails further to catch less wind or even lowering the mast, or else letting out the sea anchor to help keep the back of the ship facing the wind.\f* allowing the wind to drive¦104822 the ship along¦104822.
\v 18 We were violently¦104823 tossed¦104826 around by the storm¦104826, and the next day¦104828 the crew started \add lightening the ship by\add* tipping \add some of the cargo\add* overboard.
\v 19 By the third¦104834 day¦104834, the sailors themselves \add in desperation\add* were even throwing some of the ship's gear overboard.
\v 20 We didn't see either the sun¦104844 or the stars¦104846 for several more days¦104851—it wasn't a minor storm¦104852 by any means—and¦104853 by then any remaining hope that we had \add of staying alive\add* disappeared
\v 21 and no one had eaten or drunk much at all.
\p Then Paul¦104873 stood¦104871 up in the middle of them and said¦104877, “Well, you should have listened to me after all and not left Crete, so now we have this damage¦104892 and loss.
\v 22 Nevertheless I think we can all cheer¦104902 up because¦104904 not a single life¦104905 will be lost—only the ship¦104913—
\v 23 because last night¦104920 an angel¦104931 of the God¦104924 that I serve came and stood¦104914 beside me
\v 24 and told me not to be afraid because I would indeed get to stand¦104939 before Caesar and that God¦104945 has granted¦104942 your lives to me as well.
\v 25 So cheer¦104952 up, fellows, because¦104955 I am certain that God¦104957 will carry out what was told to me
\v 26 even though we'll run¦104974 aground¦104974 onto an island¦104968 first.”
\p
\v 27 So it happened that in the middle¦104987 of our fourteenth¦104977 night of being¦104981 blown across the Adriatic¦104985 Sea, the sailors¦104992 suspected¦104990 that we were nearing land.
\v 28 They dropped a weighted line and measured the ocean depth at around 40 metres and then a bit later it was down to 30 metres.
\v 29 Worrying that the ship might run¦105028 aground¦105028 on rough¦105025 \add rocks\add*, they threw out four¦105034 anchors¦105033 from the stern¦105031 as they hoped that daylight would come¦105038 quickly.
\v 30 Then the sailors¦105041 lowered¦105049 the lifeboat¦105051 as if planning to pull out some anchors¦105061 from the bow, but really planning to desert the ship¦105047.
\v 31 However Paul¦105066 told the centurion¦105068 and¦105069 the soldiers¦105071 that if the sailors didn't remain¦105075 with the ship¦105078, everybody couldn't be sure to be saved¦105081,
\v 32 so the soldiers¦105087 cut the ropes¦105090 attaching the lifeboat¦105092 and¦105093 allowed¦105094 it to run¦105096 aground¦105096.
\p
\v 33 As they waited for the daylight, Paul¦105109 encouraged them all to eat something, saying¦105113, “Today¦105115 is our fourteenth¦105114 day and you've had nothing¦105120 to eat. As we're waiting¦105117,
\v 34 I urge you to eat something. This will help you to have strength because¦105132 none of you are going to drown.”
\v 35 Having said¦105151 that, he gave¦105157 thanks¦105157 to God¦105160 in front of everyone, and breaking some bread¦105156, started eating¦105166 it.
\v 36 They all cheered¦105167 up and also started eating.
\v 37 There were two¦105191 hundred¦105191 and seventy-six¦105192 of them on the ship¦105189
\v 38 and when they'd all eaten what they wanted, they lightened¦105199 the ship¦105201 more by throwing¦105202 their wheat¦105204 into the sea¦105207.
\s1 The ship runs aground
\p
\v 39 Once it became¦105211 light, they saw that they were close to shore¦105222 in a bay but didn't recognise¦105216 the place. After some discussion, they decided to try to save the ship¦105235
\v 40 so they cut away the anchors¦105238 that were holding them in the sea¦105244 and untied the rudder¦105250 \add handles\add*. Then raising the foresail¦105254, they let the wind¦105255 blow them into the shore¦105260.
\v 41 But they hit a bank with ocean on both sides of it and the ship ran aground¦105266. The bow of the ship was completely stuck¦105275 but the stern¦105281 was being¦105282 broken up by the force¦105286 of the ocean.
\p
\v 42 At this point the soldiers¦105291 decided that they¦105297 should kill¦105297 the prisoners¦105296 in case any of them decided to swim away and escape¦105301,
\v 43 but the centurion¦105305 wanted to keep Paul¦105310 safe so he vetoed that plan. He commanded¦105317 those who could swim to jump off and swim in to shore,
\v 44 and for the others¦105340 to grab \add floating\add* planks¦105338 or something off the ship¦105346 \add that would float\add*, and so everyone got safely¦105351 onto the beach.

\s1 On the island of Malta
\p
\v 1 Once everyone was safe, we¦105359 discovered that the island¦105364 is called¦105365 Malta.
\v 2 And the people there showed incredible kindness¦105375 to us as they¦105382 welcomed us and lit a fire¦105380, as it¦105377 started raining again and was very cold¦105393.
\v 3 However when Paul¦105397 was helping to pick up sticks¦105398 and putting them on the fire¦105408, a viper¦105409 was driven out by the heat and clamped¦105416 its jaws down on his¦105420 hand¦105419.
\v 4 When the islanders saw¦105423 the snake hanging from his hand¦105432 they decided that he must be a murderer¦105439 who had survived the shipwreck but now fate had finally decided his time was up.
\v 5 However, Paul just shook the snake off into the fire¦105463 and wasn't harmed.
\v 6 The locals were waiting¦105483 for his arm to swell¦105474 up or for him to fall down dead¦105478, but after a while when nothing¦105486 happened they changed¦105491 their¦105491 minds¦105491 and decided that instead, he must be a god¦105499.
\p
\v 7 The area that we had beached in belonged to the leader¦105510 of the island¦105512 named Publius. He welcomed us and¦105512 looked after us for three¦105518 days¦105519,
\v 8 but while we were there, his father¦105526 got sick with dysentery¦105531 and fever¦105529. Paul¦105538 went in and placing his hands¦105545 on him, prayed¦105541 for him and healed¦105547 him.
\v 9 As a result of that, anyone on the whole island¦105561 who was sick came and was cured
\v 10 and so the people brought us many gifts and when we left, they supplied us with provisions.
\s1 Sailing from Malta to Rome
\p
\v 11 After three¦105586 months¦105587 were were able to leave on an Alexandrian¦105596 ship¦105591 that had wintered¦105592 at the island¦105595. It was decorated with carvings of the twin ‘gods’.
\v 12 We stayed three¦105606 days¦105604 when we¦105603 arrived at Syracuse
\v 13 and then we sailed on to Rhegium. The next day a south¦105619 wind came so we sailed on to Puteoli
\v 14 where¦105624 we found¦105625 some believers¦105626 and they encouraged us to stay for seven¦105634 days¦105633. Then we \add finally\add* got to Rome.
\v 15 The believers¦105645 in Rome had heard¦105646 about us, so they came¦105650 to meet us at the Appius Market¦105660 and the Three¦105662 Taverns¦105663. Paul¦105667 was encouraged to see them and thanked¦105668 God¦105670.
\s1 Paul shares in Ruma
\p
\v 16 When we¦105675 got into Rome proper, Paul¦105691 was allowed to live by himself¦105696, with just a soldier¦105701 guarding¦105699 him¦105700.
\p
\v 17 After three¦105706 days¦105705, he called together the leaders¦105715 of the Jews¦105714 \add in Rome\add*, and when they'd all gathered he spoke to them, “Men, brothers¦105725, I have done nothing¦105727 against my people¦105731 or against our ancestral¦105736 customs¦105734. I was taken prisoner¦105737 in Jerusalem¦105739 and handed over to the Romans
\v 18 who, after examining¦105747 me, wanted to release me because¦105753 I had done nothing worthy of execution.
\v 19 But in defending myself against the Jews there, I felt compelled¦105765 to appeal¦105766 to Caesar, although I myself had no complaint against the Jews.
\v 20 So that was why I called for you and wanted to address¦105788 you, because¦105778 I am in chains¦105798 for the sake of Israel's hope—\add the messiah\add*.”
\p
\v 21 “We haven't received¦105814 any correspondence here about you,” they answered. “Nor have any of our brothers¦105822 \add from Jerusalem\add* arrived¦105819 here to report¦105823 any crimes of yours.
\v 22 But we would very much like to hear¦105835 from you about your thinking¦105837, because we've certainly heard about this new sect because everyone¦105849 is speaking out against¦105850 it.”
\p
\v 23 Then they set a day¦105854 when they could visit him where he was staying and so that from morning¦105890 to evening¦105892 he could explain¦105865 about God's kingdom¦105871 and show them how Moses' law and the prophets' writings spoke about Yeshua¦105880.
\v 24 Afterwards some were persuaded¦105897 while others¦105901 didn't find it believable.
\v 25 They argued back and forth, and as they¦105909 were about to leave, Paul¦105912 shared this final¦105914 message¦105913, “The pure¦105920 spirit¦105918 spoke¦105921 rightly through Isaiah the prophet¦105926 to your¦105930 ancestors¦105929, saying:
\q1
\v 26 Go to these people¦105941 and tell them,
\q1 When you listen you will hear¦105946 but not understand¦105952,
\q1 and when you look you will see but not perceive¦105960 it.
\q1
\v 27 Because¦105963 these people's¦105967 minds have become¦105962 dull
\q2 and they can barely hear with their ears
\q2 and they shut their eyes,
\q1 just in case their eyes might actually see,
\q2 and their ears might actually hear,
\q2 and they might understand¦105991 with their minds,
\q1 and turn back to me
\q2 and then I would heal them.
\p
\v 28 So now let it¦106001 be known¦105999 to you¦106002 all that the \add message of\add* salvation¦106010 from God¦106012 has been sent¦106007 out to non-Jews¦106006 and¦106014 they¦106013 will listen.”
\p
\v 29 ≈
\v 30 Paul remained¦106028 in his own rental¦106038 accommodation in Rome for two¦106034 whole¦106035 years¦106034 and¦106039 welcomed¦106040 everyone who went to see him¦106045,
\v 31 telling them about God's kingdom¦106048 and¦106051 boldly teaching¦106052 about the master¦106056 Yeshua¦106057 without any hindrance.
