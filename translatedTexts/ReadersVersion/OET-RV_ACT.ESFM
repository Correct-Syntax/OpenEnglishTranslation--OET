\mt2 The second account by
\mt1 Luke
\mt2 commonly called
\mt1 Acts
\is1 Introduction
\is2 Author
\ip This account commonly known as \bk The Acts of the Ambassadors of Yeshua the Messiah\bk*, is the continuation of \bk The Good Message according to Luke\bk*, and unlike most other Bibles, the \em Open English Translation\em* places these two accounts one after the other.
\is2 This account
\ip The main purpose of this account is to tell about the actions of the first followers of Yeshua the messiah. The spirit of the master helped them to proclaim good message about him “in Jerusalem and all across \add the provinces of\add* Judea and Samaria, and all the way to the furtherest parts of the planet” (1:8).
\ip This document has three divisions related to the expanding circles as the good message from Yeshua the messiah spread wider and wider: (1) In \bd Jerusalem\bd* where the believers start to get organised after Yeshua ascended up into the clouds; (2) the work and the message spreads wider out to all of the district of \bd Judea\bd*; and (3) spreading more widely again around the Mediterranean Ocean and all the way to \bd Rome\bd*.
\ip It's also documented here about how God's spirit came to the believers as they were together in a room in Jerusalem at the Feast of Pentecost (fifty days after The Passover). The spirit helps and gives wisdom and strength to the believers and teachers of believers.

\s1 Introduction
\p
\v 1 \x + \xo 1:1: \xt Luk 1:1-4.\x*Dear Theophilus¦82411, I wrote my first¦82405 account¦82406 about all the things¦82409 that Yeshua began¦82413 to do and¦82418 to teach¦82419
\v 2 until¦82420 the day¦82422 when he was taken¦82432 up\x + \xo 1:1: \xt Luk 24:51.\x* \add into the sky\add* after, with the help of the pure spirit¦82428, having¦82424 commanded¦82424 the ambassadors¦82426 that he had chosen¦82431.
\s1 Yeshua, alive, tells them to wait
\p
\v 3 After the time¦82446 of his suffering¦82447, Yeshua presented¦82442 himself¦82443 to them in ways that were infallible proofs¦82451 \add that he was alive again\add*—appearing¦82456 to them and telling them about God's kingdom¦82465.
\v 4 \x + \xo 1:4: \xt Luk 24:49.\x*Once when they were together¦82469, he told them, “Don't leave Jerusalem, but wait there for what was promised¦82483 by the father¦82485, as you all have \add already\add* heard¦82487 me say.
\v 5 \x + \xo 1:5: \xt Mat 3:11; Mrk 1:8; Luk 3:16; Jn 1:33.\x*John¦82495 immersed \add people\add* in water¦82498, but you all will be immersed in the pure spirit¦82503 in just a few days¦82515.”
\s1 Yeshua's ascension
\p
\v 6 So when they were \add next\add* gathered together¦82523, they asked him¦82527, “Master, is this now the time when you'll be restoring¦82535 the kingdom¦82538 to Israel?”\f + \fr 1:6 \ft At the time of asking, Israelis were burdened under the rule and taxes of the Roman occupiers.\f*
\p
\v 7 But Yeshua responded to them, “You don't need to know¦82553 the times¦82554 or seasons¦82556 \add when future events will happen\add*—it's the father¦82559 who decides all that.
\v 8 \x + \xo 1:8: \xt Mat 28:19; Mrk 16:15; Luk 24:47-48.\x*However, you all will be receiving¦82566 power¦82567 when the pure spirit¦82571 lands on you. Then you'll tell \add people\add* about me in Jerusalem and all across \add the provinces of\add* Judea and Samaria¦82588, and all the way to the furtherest parts of the planet.
\v 9 \x + \xo 1:9: \xt Mrk 16:19; Luk 24:50-51.\x*After he'd said¦82597 that and while they were still looking at him, he was lifted¦82604 up \add into the sky\add* until they could no longer see him because of the cloud\add s\add*.
\p
\v 10 As they¦82619 stood¦82629 there staring into the sky¦82622 after he'd gone, suddenly two¦82628 men¦82627 in white¦82636 clothes¦82633 were standing beside them
\v 11 and said, “You men from Galilee¦82642! Why are you still standing there looking¦82645 up at the sky? This Yeshua who has been taken¦82654 up away from you into heaven will come back in the same way that you saw him go up into heaven.”
\s1 Matthias replaces Judas Iscariot
\p
\v 12 Then they¦82671 walked down the Mount of Olives¦82678 and returned¦82671 to Jerusalem which¦82679 was less than a kilometre away.
\v 13 \x + \xo 1:13: \xt Mat 10:2-4; Mrk 3:16-19; Luk 6:14-16.\x*They went¦82696 into the upstairs room where¦82697 they were staying¦82699—Peter and John, Jacob and Andrew¦82710, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew¦82714 and Matthew¦82716, Jacob (son of Alpheus), Simon (the Zealot member¦82724), and Judas (son of Jacob).
\v 14 They were united in their¦82755 ongoing prayers¦82735, along with Maria¦82745 the mother¦82748 of Yeshua¦82750, and his¦82755 brothers¦82754.
\p
\v 15 Then one day, Peter¦82764 stood¦82762 up in the meeting of the believers (about¦82781 120 of them) and¦82772 said¦82770,
\v 16 “Brothers, it was necessary for the scripture¦82791 to be fulfilled¦82789, where the pure spirit¦82796 had spoken previously¦82794 through David about Judas, the one who guided¦82806 those that arrested Yeshua¦82810
\v 17 because Judas was one of us and¦82817 took his part in our work.
\p
\v 18 \x + \xo 1:18-19: \xt Mat 27:3-8.\x*(Judas had bought a field with the money he had received for his treachery, and when he had fallen down \add in that field\add*, his stomach had burst¦82839 open and his intestines¦82845 had slid out \add on the ground\add*.
\v 19 So everyone in Jerusalem started calling that place ‘The field of blood¦82870’.)
\p
\v 20 \x + \xo 1:20: a \xt Psa 69:25; \xo b \xt Psa 109:8.\x*Now it was written¦82871 in the scroll¦82874 of songs:
\q1 ‘Let his place become¦82876 deserted with no one living there,’
\m and
\q1 ‘Let another¦82895 person take¦82894 his position.’
\p
\v 21 So now it's appropriate for one of the men¦82901 that has been with us for the whole time¦82905 that the master¦82915 Yeshua¦82916 was interacting with us,
\v 22 \x + \xo 1:22: a \xt Mat 3:16; Mrk 1:9; Luk 3:21; \xo b \xt Mrk 16:19; Luk 24:51.\x*from Yeshua's immersion¦82921 by John until¦82924 the day¦82926 that he was lifted up from us \add into the clouds\add*—a witness¦82931 of the resurrection¦82933—to fill this position.
\p
\v 23 So they¦82942 selected two¦82944 men: Joseph Barsabbas¦82949 (nicknamed Justus) and¦82953 Matthias¦82954.
\v 24 Then they requested, “Master, you know everyone's inner thoughts, so reveal¦82965 to us which¦82966 of these¦82969 two¦82971 that you have chosen¦82967
\v 25 to take this position of service¦82983 and being an ambassador—the position that Judas¦82991 deserted to go to his own place.”
\v 26 So they drew straws and Matthias¦83010 was marked so he was chosen¦83014 to join the eleven¦83018 ambassadors¦83019.
\c 2
\s1 God's spirit arrives and many get saved
\p
\v 1 \x + \xo 2:1: \xt Lev 23:15-21; Deu 16:9-11.\x*When the Day of Pentecost actually arrived, the believers met together¦83040 in the same¦83044 room.
\v 2 Suddenly there was a noise in the sky that sounded¦83052 like a strong wind, then it¦83059 filled¦83059 the entire house¦83063 where¦83064 they¦83065 were sitting¦83067.
\v 3 They saw what looked like tongues¦83072 of fire¦83074 that kept dividing¦83071\f + \fr 3:1 \ft See https://www.billmounce.com/monday-with-mounce/what-%E2%80%9Cdivided-tongue%E2%80%9D-acts-2-3-0\f* and¦83075 then settling down on each one of them.
\v 4 In this way they were all filled¦83085 with the pure spirit and began¦83091 speaking in other¦83094 languages as the spirit enabled them.
\p
\v 5 At the time, there were godly Jews staying in Jerusalem that had come from other countries all around the world.
\v 6 When they heard this noise, lots of people came¦83129 to investigate but they were confused because¦83135 they heard the believers talking in their¦83148 own languages¦83143 \add from around the world\add*.
\v 7 They were astounded and¦83153 marvelled¦83154, asking, “Wow, aren't these¦83163 people talking all Galileans¦83168?
\v 8 So how come we're hearing¦83172 them speak the languages¦83177 of the countries where we were born?
\v 9 There's people here from Parthia¦83184, Media, Elam, Mesopotamia¦83193, Judea, Cappadocia, Pontus, Asia,
\v 10 Phrygia, Pamphylia, Egypt, Libya (near Cyrene), and visitors¦83218 from Rome,
\v 11 Crete, and Arabia¦83227. Some are Jews and some are non-Jews who've converted¦83223 \add to Judaism\add*. And we¦83229 can hear them talking about God in our¦83233 languages.”
\v 12 Everyone was amazed and¦83242 totally puzzled, asking each other, “What's going on here?”
\v 13 But others¦83260 scoffed and said, “Ha, they've just had too much to drink.”
\s1 Peter's sermon
\p
\v 14 So the twelve stood¦83273 up and Peter told the crowd in a loud voice¦83285, “People of Judea and everyone staying in Jerusalem. Listen to me so that I can explain this to you.
\v 15 This group is not drunk¦83318 like you're all thinking, because it's still mid-morning,
\v 16 but¦83329 you're seeing what the prophet¦83336 Joel¦83337 wrote about:
\q1
\v 17 \x + \xo 2:17-21: \xt Joel 2:28-32 (LXX).\x*God said, ‘In the last days¦83345 I will pour out my¦83354 spirit¦83353 on all humanity—your children will tell of future events, your young¦83373 men will see visions¦83375, and your old men will have dreams¦83383 \add from God\add*.
\v 18 I will pour my spirit¦83408 out on my male and female slaves¦83391 and they¦83412 will tell of future events.
\v 19 I will do unusual things with the stars and planets, and also down on the earth¦83424 below¦83425: blood¦83426, fire¦83428, and clouds of smoke¦83431.
\v 20 I'll make the sun¦83433 go dark and the moon¦83441 go blood¦83443 red. This will happen before¦83444 the great¦83451 victorious day¦83448 of the coming of the master¦83449.
\v 21 Then everyone¦83456 who relies on the name¦83462 and authority of the master¦83464 will be saved¦83465.’
\p
\v 22 “Fellow Israelis, listen to this account: You yourselves¦83503 know that God did miracles¦83486 through Yeshua from Nazareth¦83475, and he fulfilled signs¦83490 \add from the scriptures\add*—in fact God did this right in front of you.
\v 23 \x + \xo 2:23: \xt Mat 27:35; Mrk 15:24; Luk 23:33; Jn 19:18.\x*Then as part of God's plan and foreknowledge¦83510, this Yeshua was taken to the authorities by those who didn't follow their¦83518 own laws, and you¦83520 all killed¦83520 him by having him executed¦83519 on a pole.
\v 24 \x + \xo 2:24: \xt Mat 28:5-6; Mrk 16:6; Luk 24:5.\x*But God released¦83526 him from the agonies¦83528 of death and brought him back to life—death couldn't restrain¦83536 him.
\v 25 \x + \xo 2:25-28: \xt Psa 16:8-11 (LXX).\x*As David wrote,
\q1 ‘I foresaw¦83547 the master¦83549 always being in front of me. I refuse to be afraid because¦83555 he's there on my¦83558 right¦83557.
\q1
\v 26 Because¦83563 of that, I was happy and spoke out my¦83567 praises. My¦83567 whole body lives in anticipation
\v 27 because¦83585 you will never abandon¦83587 my¦83590 soul¦83589 in Hades¦83593, nor will you allow the godly one to decay¦83600.
\v 28 You showed me the roads to life¦83605. You fill me with gladness¦83608 because of your¦83613 presence¦83612.’
\p
\v 29 “Fellow Israelis, we can tell you¦83621 all with confidence¦83619 that our patriarch¦83624 David both died¦83628 and was buried¦83630, and his¦83635 tomb¦83634 is still here with us today.
\v 30 \x + \xo 2:30: \xt Psa 132:11; 2Sam 7:12-13.\x*So because he was a prophet¦83644, and knowing that God has promised him to seat one of his descendants on his throne¦83674,
\v 31 he was foretelling the resurrection¦83681 of the messiah¦83683 who was neither¦83685 ‘abandoned in Hades¦83694 nor did his¦83699 body decay¦83702.’
\v 32 Then God raised¦83707 this Yeshua back to life and we're all witnesses¦83715 of that.
\v 33 Now he's sitting at God's right¦83718 hand¦83718, and having received¦83732 the promise¦83726 of the pure spirit¦83728 from the father¦83735, he poured¦83736 this out which¦83738 you are all seeing¦83744 and hearing¦83746 \add today\add*.
\v 34 \x + \xo 2:34-35: \xt Psa 110:1.\x*You see, David never went¦83750 up to the heavens¦83753, but he himself¦83758 said,
\q1 ‘The master said to my master: Sit down at my right¦83768
\q1
\v 35 until¦83770 I defeat your¦83776 enemies¦83775.’
\p
\v 36 “So let all Israel know that this Yeshua¦83805 that you¦83807 executed¦83808 on a pole, God made him¦83793 both the master¦83791 and¦83794 the messiah¦83795.”
\p
\v 37 When the people heard¦83814 that, they were deeply troubled and asked Peter and the other¦83834 ambassadors¦83835, “What should we¦83838 do then, brothers¦83841?”
\p
\v 38 Peter responded, “Turn away \add from your sins\add* and each one of you needs to be immersed¦83853 by the authority of Yeshua¦83862 the messiah¦83863. Then your sins will be forgiven¦83865 and you all will receive¦83871 the gift¦83873 of the pure spirit¦83876,
\v 39 because that promise¦83882 is to you all and your¦83887 children¦83885 and to their¦83902 descendants—to anyone who will call out to the master¦83899, our¦83902 God.”
\p
\v 40 Then Peter shared further teaching with them and¦83910 encouraged them to save themselves out from this corrupt generation¦83917.
\v 41 Because of that, those who welcomed¦83926 his¦83930 teaching were immersed¦83931 and about¦83941 three¦83942 thousand¦83942 people were added¦83933 to their numbers that day¦83937.
\v 42 They continued listening to the teaching¦83949 of the ambassadors¦83951, and in building their¦83960 relationships with each other, and in breaking¦83959 bread¦83961 and praying together.
\s1 The lifestyle of the early believers
\p
\v 43 They were serious in their learning about God, and the ambassadors¦83980 did many miracles and signs¦83976 of God's power in Jerusalem and all the people wanted to be right with God.
\v 44 \x + \xo 2:44: \xt Acts 4:32-35.\x*All those who did believe¦83996 were united in purpose¦84000 and had shared use of many things¦84005.
\v 45 Some sold their properties¦84009 and possessions¦84014 and divided¦84018 them among the group so that everyone had everything they needed.
\v 46 Each day¦84032 they¦84051 \add worshipped\add* together at the temple¦84039 and also went to various homes to break¦84046 bread¦84050 together. They talked about Yeshua at their¦84058 mealtimes without sophisication,
\v 47 praising¦84059 God and being popular with the people¦84069, and every¦84076 day¦84077 the master¦84072 was adding¦84073 more that were being saved¦84075.

\s1 A lame man starts bouncing around
\p
\v 1 One afternoon at 3pm, Peter and John were going¦84097 to the prayer¦84109 meeting in the temple¦84100.
\v 2 Now there was a man¦84116 who had been lame from birth and everyday¦84127, was placed beside a door¦84131 of the temple. (It was entry named ‘Beautiful Door’.) From there he could beg from the people entering¦84143 the temple.
\v 3 He saw Peter and¦84157 John about to enter¦84161 into the temple¦84164, so he¦84163 asked them for a donation,
\v 4 but Peter and John, looking closely at him¦84177, said¦84183, “Look at us!”
\v 5 So the man grabbed onto them, expecting¦84193 to receive¦84199 something¦84194 from them.
\v 6 But Peter said¦84200, “I don't have any silver or gold¦84208, but I'll give you what I do have. With the authority of Yeshua the messiah¦84222 from Nazareth¦84224, \add I command you\add* to walk.”
\v 7 Then Peter grabbed¦84230 him by the right¦84233 hand¦84234 and pulled him upwards. Immediately the man's feet¦84245 and ankles¦84250 were strengthened¦84242
\v 8 and he jumped up and stood¦84254 and started walking and went into the temple¦84264 with them, walking and skipping and praising¦84269 God.
\v 9 All the people¦84277 \add there\add* saw¦84273 him¦84278 walking¦84279 and¦84280 praising¦84281 \add \add* God
\v 10 and recognising¦84285 that he was the man who usually sat \add outside\add* begging at the ‘Beautiful Door’ of the temple¦84308, they were astonished and astounded at what had happened¦84318 to him.
\s1 Peter's sermon in the temple
\p
\v 11 As the man clung onto Peter and John, all the people¦84343 ran¦84336 to see them in Solomon's¦84357 Porch and very very amazed¦84360.
\v 12 But when Peter saw \add the crowd\add*, he¦84370 answered¦84367 their thoughts¦84384, “Fellow Israelis, why are you all puzzled about this, and why are you staring at us as if this man's walking¦84397 because of \em our\em* power¦84388 or closeness to God.”
\v 13 \x + \xo 3:13: \xt Exo 3:15.\x*The god of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob—the god of our¦84405 fathers¦84414—gave honour to his¦84405 servant¦84419, Yeshua, who you handed over \add to be killed\add* and rejected him when Pilate¦84436 had judged¦84438 him and wanted to release him.
\v 14 \x + \xo 3:14: \xt Mat 27:15-23; Mrk 15:6-14; Luk 23:13-23; Jn 19:12-15.\x*You disowned¦84451 this man¦84455 who was innocent and sinless, and instead you requested¦84453 that a murderer¦84456 be released to you,
\v 15 however in doing so, you¦84464 killed¦84464 the creator of life¦84463, who God then raised¦84468 from the dead¦84470 as we¦84473 can attest.
\v 16 Now it's \add our¦84492\add* faith in the authority of Yeshua that has strengthened¦84489 \add the legs\add* of this man that you have seen and that you already knew—this authority and faith that comes from Yeshua completely¦84502 healed this main right in front¦84504 of you all.
\p
\v 17 So now, friends, I know that you did that in ignorance¦84517, just like your¦84524 leaders.
\v 18 But God was fulfilling¦84541 what he had had written by the prophets¦84535, that the messiah¦84539 should suffer¦84537.
\v 19 Because of that, \add you¦84552 all need to\add* repent¦84543 and¦84545 turn¦84547 back \add to God\add* so that your¦84552 sins¦84554 can be erased
\v 20 and then times¦84560 of refreshing¦84561 will come¦84559 from the presence¦84563 of the master¦84565, and so that he may send¦84567 back Yeshua¦84573 the messiah¦84572 who has been appointed¦84569 \add to save\add* you.
\v 21 \add For now\add* it¦84577 is appropriate for heaven¦84578 to receive¦84580 him¦84600, until¦84581 the times¦84582 of restoration¦84584 of everything, which¦84586 \add again\add* God has had written by the faithful prophets¦84601.
\v 22 \x + \xo 3:22: \xt Deu 18:15,18 (LXX).\x*Indeed¦84603 Moses said¦84605, ‘The master¦84616, our¦84619 God will raise up a prophet¦84612 for you that's like one of your¦84625 own brothers¦84623. You must listen to everything he says—whatever he tells you.
\v 23 \x + \xo 3:23: \xt Deu 18:19.\x*Everyone who doesn't listen to that prophet¦84650 will end up totally destroyed¦84652 and not part of \add God's\add* people¦84656.’
\v 24 Similarly, the prophets¦84661 from Samuel¦84663 onwards spoke in turn, and when they spoke they foretold these¦84677 \add current\add* days¦84676.
\v 25 \x + \xo 3:25: \xt Gen 22:18.\x*And you are the descendants of those prophets¦84683, and part of the agreement between God and your ancestors, when he told Abraham, ‘All the families¦84711 in the world will be blessed¦84708 by one of your descendants.’
\v 26 God had raised¦84716 up his¦84722 servant¦84721 and sent¦84724 him to you \add Jews\add* first¦84715, to bless¦84727 you by turning¦84732 each of you away from your¦84741 own wicked¦84739 \add behaviour\add*.”

\s1 Peter and John are threatened by the religious leaders
\p
\v 1 While Peter and John were still talking to the people¦84747, the chief¦84754 priests¦84754 and a temple¦84760 officer¦84758 and some from the Sadducee sect approached¦84751 them
\v 2 because¦84769 they were very upset about what they had been teaching¦84771 the people¦84774, including preaching that Yeshua¦84781 could give life to the dead¦84791.
\v 3 So they arrested the two, and as it¦84807 was already¦84810 evening¦84809, they put them in jail overnight.
\v 4 Despite this, many people who had heard¦84814 their message¦84816 trusted \add in Yeshua\add* and¦84818 the number¦84821 of men¦84825 who were believers¦84817 grew to around 5,000.
\p
\v 5 Then the next day¦84833, the religious leaders and the elders¦84846 and the religious teachers gathered¦84836 together¦84836 in Jerusalem¦84853
\v 6 along with those descended¦84876 from high priests¦84860, including Annas¦84856 the current high priest¦84860 and Caiaphas and John and Alexander¦84871.
\v 7 After \add having¦84879 Peter and John brought in and\add* standing them in the middle, they¦84884 began to ask, “Under what authority or name¦84891 did you¦84896 do this?”
\p
\v 8 Then Peter, having¦84899 been filled¦84899 with the pure spirit¦84900, said¦84902 to them, “Rulers¦84905 of the people¦84907 and¦84908 elders¦84909,
\v 9 if we're being¦84915 questioned today¦84914 about a good¦84919 deed done to a man¦84920 who couldn't walk and which resulted in his healing,
\v 10 then you all need to know, and the people¦84936 of Israel should also know that it was done under the authority and name of Yeshua¦84943 the messiah¦84944. He was the man from Nazareth¦84946 that you executed¦84949 on a pole, but who God brought back to life. It was by his¦84943 authority and name that this man can now stand before¦84960 you without deformity.
\v 11 \x + \xo 4:11: \xt Psa 118:22.\x*This Yeshua is
\q1 ‘the stone¦84966 which¦84976 was rejected by you¦84971 builders¦84974,
\q1 has now become¦84977 the \add vital\add* cornerstone¦84980.’
\m
\v 12 We can't be saved by anyone else, because there's¦84996 no other¦84985 name¦84994 or authority that's been given¦85004 in the entire world under¦84999 which¦85008 people¦85006 can be saved.
\p
\v 13 The assembled leaders were amazed saw the boldness¦85018 of Peter and John who they knew to be illiterate¦85025, working-class men¦85024, and then recognised¦85030 that they had been with Yeshua.
\v 14 But since the man¦85042 who was no longer deformed was standing there with them, there was nothing¦85050 that they¦85051 could really accuse them of.
\v 15 So they¦85064 had them removed from the room, and asked each other,
\v 16 “What should we do with these¦85074 fellows? By now everyone in Jerusalem's heard about the miracle they did, and we have no way to rebuff it¦85095.”
\v 17 However, we have to stop it spreading¦85105 even further, so maybe we should ban them from speaking¦85119 about this name¦85122 \add or authority\add* to anyone.
\v 18 So they called¦85133 them back in and decreed that they weren't allowed to preach or teach¦85144 under the name¦85147 \add or authority\add* of Yeshua¦85149 anymore.
\p
\v 19 But Peter and¦85154 John answered¦85157, “You judge \add for yourselves\add* whether¦85163 it's right¦85164 in God's eyes to listen to you¦85169 rather¦85171 than to him?
\v 20 As for us, we're not able to be silent about what we saw¦85182 and heard¦85185.”
\v 21 So after making some further¦85190 threats¦85190, the leaders sent¦85191 them off. They hadn't been able to find anything to punish¦85199 them for because the people¦85205 were all praising God for what had happened
\v 22 because the man¦85221 who had miraculously recovered was over forty¦85218 years¦85214 old.
\s1 The believers ask God for power
\p
\v 23 After Peter and John had been released, they went to their¦85235 own \add group\add* and told them what the chief¦85244 priests¦85244 and elders¦85247 had said¦85248.
\v 24 \x + \xo 4:24: \xt Exo 20:11; Neh 9:6; Psa 146:6.\x*When they heard¦85252 this, they all began to pray out loud to God, saying, “Master¦85268, you¦85269 created heaven¦85275 and the earth¦85278 and the sea¦85281 and everything in them.
\v 25 \x + \xo 4:25-26: \xt Psa 2:1-2 (LXX).\x*You spoke \add long ago\add* by the pure spirit¦85293 through our¦85291 ancestor who was your¦85291 servant¦85301, David, when you¦85302 said¦85303,
\q1 ‘Why are the other nations angry and¦85308 their¦85291 peoples¦85309 tried new \add ideas\add*?”
\q1
\v 26 The earthly¦85317 kings¦85315 and rulers¦85320 stood a worked together¦85321 against the master¦85327 and against his¦85332 messiah¦85331.’
\m
\v 27 \x + \xo 4:27: a \xt Luk 23:7-11; \xo b \xt Mat 27:1-2; Mrk 15:1; Luk 23:1; Jn 18:28-29.\x*And indeed Herod and Pontius¦85354 Pilate¦85355 met with the pagan¦85357 \add Romans\add* and the peoples¦85359 of Israel to conspire against¦85342 your¦85346 pure servant¦85345 Yeshua who you chose.
\v 28 Then they did exactly what your¦85365 power and plan had already decided would happen.
\v 29 So now, master¦85375, see their¦85381 threats¦85379 and¦85382 help us, your slaves¦85385, to be able to proclaim your message¦85393 with boldness¦85389.
\v 30 Let us experience your power to heal and do miracles and things that confirm the scriptures by means of the name¦85414 \add and authority\add* of your pure servant¦85417, Yeshua¦85419.”
\p
\v 31 As they finished their¦85422 requests, the place¦85425 where they had met was shaken¦85423 and all of them were filled¦85431 with the pure spirit¦85438, and they \add went out and\add* proclaimed God's message¦85442 with boldness¦85446.
\s1 The believers share their wealth and possessions
\p
\v 32 \x + \xo 4:32: \xt Acts 2:44-45.\x*And so the group of believers¦85455 were united in their will and attitude. No one claimed anything¦85474 to be their own, but they shared everything they had.
\v 33 The ambassadors¦85499 of the master¦85507, Yeshua¦85508, experienced great power¦85493 and proclaimed the truth about how he came back to life, and \add God's\add* favour was with them.
\v 34 None of them were lacking anything, because any of them who owned properties¦85532 or houses¦85535 would sell them and bring¦85540 the proceeds.
\v 35 They would lay them down in front of the ambassadors¦85552, and from there it¦85553 was distributed¦85553 around according to what needs each person had.
\p
\v 36 Joseph (a Levite born in Cyprus who was nicknamed ‘Barnabas’, meaning ‘Encourager’, by the ambassadors¦85573)
\v 37 owned a field¦85588 which he sold, and brought¦85590 the money¦85592 and put it down in front of the ambassadors¦85600.
\c 5
\s1 The death of Ananias and Sapphira
\p
\v 1 But in contrast, a couple named Ananias¦85604 and Sapphira sold a property¦85614
\v 2 but agreed together to hide some of the proceeds. So Ananias brought¦85628 a smaller amount and put it¦85636 down in front of the ambassadors¦85635.
\v 3 Then Peter said¦85638, “Ananias¦85644, why has Satan¦85652 filled¦85648 your¦85655 mind such that you would lie to the pure spirit¦85659 and keep aside some of the proceeds of the property¦85670?
\v 4 Wasn't it yours before it was sold? And even when it was sold, the money was still yours. Why did you decide to handle it like this? It wasn't people¦85699 that you're lying to, but God.”
\v 5 When Ananias¦85707 heard that, he fell down and stopped¦85713 breathing¦85713. Everyone who heard about it felt very afraid,
\v 6 and the young¦85726 men¦85726 there stood up and covered¦85727 his \add body\add*, carried it out, and buried¦85731 him.
\p
\v 7 After about three¦85737 hours¦85736, Ananias' wife¦85741 came in, not knowing anything about what had happened.
\v 8 Peter checked, “Is it true that you¦85766 guys sold the property¦85764 for such-and-such an amount?”
\p “Yes, for that amount,” she¦85767 replied.
\p
\v 9 But Peter said¦85775 to her¦85793, “Why did the two of you agree¦85782 to test the spirit¦85787 of the master¦85789? The guys wh just buried¦85794 your¦85793 husband¦85796 are just out the door¦85801, and they'll carry you out also.”
\v 10 Sapphira immediately¦85809 fell down in front of him¦85814 and stopped¦85816 breathing¦85816. Then the young¦85820 men¦85820 came in and found¦85821 her dead¦85824, so they took \add her body out\add* and buried¦85830 her with her husband¦85833.
\v 11 So the entire assembly¦85842 of believers became¦85836 very afraid, along with every else who heard about these¦85849 events.
\s1 Ongoing miracles and healings
\p
\v 12 The ambassadors¦85856 went on to do many miracles and amazing things, and all the people¦85866 who gathered in Solomon's¦85880 Porch had a single visions,
\v 13 but¦85892 no one else dared to join them. However, the people¦85896 were talking positively about them
\v 14 and more were becoming believers¦85901 in the master¦85903—big numbers of both men and women¦85908.
\v 15 Some would even bring¦85915 those who were sick¦85917 out to the side of the road, lying them on beds and mats waiting for Peter¦85929 to come past so that his¦85936 shadow¦85932 might touch them.
\v 16 More crowds were coming¦85947 from the towns around Jerusalem¦85958, bringing¦85959 those who were sick¦85960 and those tormented¦85962 by demons, and they were all getting healed¦85969.
\s1 The preachers get arrested but released again
\p
\v 17 But the chief¦85976 priest¦85976 and his colleagues who were members of the sect of Sadducees¦85986 were filled¦85987 with jealously¦85988 and took action
\v 18 by having the ambassadors¦85998 arrested and thrown into the public¦86004 jail.
\v 19 But one of the master's¦86015 angels¦86012 opened¦86021 the prison¦86027 doors¦86025 during the night¦86018 and¦86029 led them out again, saying,
\v 20 “Now go and stand in the temple¦86039 and keep telling the people¦86041 all the teaching about \add new\add* life¦86046.”
\v 21 So at dawn, having taken notice of the angel, they went into the temple¦86056 and started teaching¦86058 \add the people there again\add*.
\p When the chief¦86063 priest¦86063 arrived¦86059 with his¦86082 companions, they called together¦86072 the \add religious\add* council and also the \add political\add* council of Israel, then called for the ambassadors to be brought¦86088 in from the prison¦86087.
\v 22 But when their attendants¦86098 got to the jail, they weren't there, so they returned¦86106 to the gathering and told them,
\v 23 “We found the prison¦86115 all locked up with the guards¦86124 in their positions at the doors¦86130, but¦86132 when they opened¦86131 it up, there was no one inside¦86133!”
\v 24 When they¦86138 heard¦86138 this, the officer¦86147 of the temple¦86149 and¦86150 the chief¦86152 priests¦86152 were totally puzzled as to what could have happened.
\v 25 But then someone¦86164 came in and¦86182 told them, “Hey, the men¦86171 that you¦86173 put in prison¦86176 are in the temple¦86180—standing there teaching¦86183 the people¦86185.”
\v 26 So the temple officer¦86189 took the attendants¦86192 and went and got them, but didn't use force¦86199 because they were afraid that the people¦86204 might start throwing rocks at them.
\p
\v 27 So they¦86212 brought¦86209 them in and stood them in front of the council¦86215, where the chief¦86221 priest¦86221 addressed them,
\v 28 \x + \xo 5:28: \xt Mat 27:25.\x*“We officially commanded¦86225 you all not to be teaching in this name¦86232 and authority. But see¦86235 here, now you have filled¦86236 Jerusalem with your¦86242 teaching, and then you're blaming us for the death of that man¦86251.”
\v 29 But Peter and¦86258 the other ambassadors¦86260 answered¦86254, “It's better to obey God than people¦86269.
\v 30 The god¦86278 of our¦86281 ancestors brought Yeshua¦86283 back to life after you¦86285 all handed¦86286 him¦86287 over to be hung up on a pole.
\v 31 But God honoured this way-maker and saviour¦86295 by placing him¦86300 on his¦86300 right¦86299, to \add encourage\add* Israel to repent¦86303 and \add then\add* to forive their¦86308 sins¦86308.
\v 32 We are witnesses¦86317 of these¦86322 messages¦86321, along with the pure spirit¦86325 who God gave¦86331 to the ones who obey him¦86336.”
\p
\v 33 When the gathered councils heard¦86339 this, they were enraged and wanted to kill¦86345 them.
\v 34 But a certain¦86349 member¦86356 of the Pharisee party¦86356 named Gamaliel¦86358 stood up in the council¦86354 chamber. He was a law teacher¦86359 respected by all the community, and he ordered the \add guards\add* to take them outside¦86367 for a while,
\v 35 then he¦86375 said¦86375, “Fellow Israelis, think carefully about what you're planning to do with these¦86395 men¦86394.
\v 36 A while back, a man called Theudas¦86406 became¦86439 prominent, saying¦86407 that he was someone¦86409 important. Eventually about¦86422 four¦86424 hundred¦86424 others joined¦86416 him, but he was killed¦86427 and those who had followed him were dispersed¦86437 and it all came¦86439 to nothing¦86441.
\v 37 A bit later a Galilean¦86447 man named Judas became prominent at the time of the census and he attracted people¦86455 to him. But he also died, and all those who'd been persuaded¦86468 by him ended up being¦86468 scattered¦86470.
\v 38 So here's my advice to you¦86477 all: pull back from \add killing\add* these¦86482 men¦86481 and allow¦86484 them, because¦86491 if this teaching and goings on is man-made, it'll be overthrown,
\v 39 but if it's from God, you all won't be able to bring them down in the case that you find yourselves opposing God.”
\p So they were persuaded¦86533 by Gamaliel,
\v 40 and after calling in the ambassadors¦86539 and having them beaten, they commanded¦86541 them not to speak¦86545 under the name¦86549 and authority of Yeshua¦86551 and then sent¦86553 them out.
\v 41 So the ambassadors left the councils¦86564, very excited that they were considered¦86566 worthy¦86566 to be disgraced because of Yeshua.
\v 42 After that, they¦86586 never stopped teaching¦86587 and preaching¦86589 the good¦86589 message¦86589 about Yeshua¦86594 the messiah¦86593 in the temple¦86581 and in various homes.
\c 6
\s1 Seven administrators appointed
\p
\v 1 However around that time when the number of Yeshua-followers were growing, some of the Greek converts starting grumbling¦86606 about the Jewish believers because¦86612 the Greek widows¦86621 were being¦86613 overlooked¦86613 in the daily¦86619 sharing \add of food and money\add*.
\v 2 So the twelve¦86631 \add ambassadors\add* assembled the believers together and told them, “We're not pleased¦86641 about having to take time off \add sharing\add* the message¦86648 of God to be serving¦86651 here at the \add distribution\add* tables¦86652.
\v 3 So brothers¦86660, look around you¦86664 for seven¦86668 men¦86662 who're well known to be full of \add God's\add* spirit¦86670 and¦86672 wisdom¦86673, so we¦86675 can appoint¦86675 them to be in charge of this part of the work.
\v 4 Then we¦86682 \add ourselves\add* can continue to pray and¦86687 share the message¦86691.”
\p
\v 5 This idea pleased¦86695 the group, so they¦86707 went ahead and chose¦86707 Stephen (a man¦86711 full of faith¦86714 and of the pure spirit¦86717), Philip, Procorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas¦86729, and Nicolas (a non-Jew from Antioch¦86734 who had previously converted¦86733 to Judaism).
\v 6 They stood¦86738 these seven up in front of the ambassadors¦86743, who prayed¦86746 and¦86744 then placed their¦86749 hands¦86750 on them.
\p
\v 7 God's message¦86753 continued spreading and the number of followers¦86763 in Jerusalem¦86765 was rapidly increasing, and a large number of the priests¦86771 became believers.
\s1 Stephen gets arrested after teaching and doing miracles
\p
\v 8 Now Stephen \add (one of the seven)\add* was full of grace¦86782 and power and was doing¦86786 miracles and amazing demonstrations of God's power among¦86791 the people¦86793.
\v 9 But a group from the Freedmen¦86811 Synagogue as well as \add Jews\add* from Cyrene, Alexandria¦86815, Cilicia, and Asia rose up and started arguing against Stephen,
\v 10 but they weren't able to refute the wisdom¦86831 that he spoke \add with the help of\add* the pure spirit¦86838.
\v 11 So they¦86859 got some men¦86860 \add to falsely accuse Stephen\add* saying¦86861, “We heard¦86864 him¦86865 denigrating Moses and¦86873 God.”
\v 12 So they stirred¦86876 up the people¦86879 and the elders¦86882 and the law teachers and so they approached¦86887 \add Stephen\add* and arrested him and brought¦86892 him to the council¦86896 \add chambers\add*.
\v 13 There they¦86898 produced the false¦86901 witnesses¦86900 saying¦86904, “This man¦86908 won't stop spreading messages¦86915 against this holy \add temple\add* and against the law
\v 14 because we¦86926 heard¦86926 him¦86928 saying¦86929 that that Yeshua from Nazareth¦86933 will be tearing¦86935 down this building and¦86939 will be changing¦86940 the traditions that Moses gave¦86945 to us.”
\v 15 So then the council¦86962 members looked¦86949 across at Stephen and saw that his¦86968 face \add was shining\add* like that of an angel¦86971.
\c 7
\s1 Stephen's history discourse and accusations
\p
\v 1 Then the chief¦86979 priest¦86979 asked \add Stephen\add*, “Is all this true?”
\p
\v 2 \x + \xo 7:2-3: \xt Gen 12:1.\x*And he replied, “My¦87004 brothers¦86993 and fathers¦86995, please listen. Our¦87004 honoured God was seen¦87001 by our¦87004 ancestor Abraham in Mesopotamia¦87009 before¦87010 he moved to Haran
\v 3 and he told him, ‘Leave your land here and your relatives¦87029, and go to the place that I will show you.’
\v 4 \x + \xo 7:4: a \xt Gen 11:31; \xo b \xt Gen 12:4.\x*So he left Chaldea and moved to Haran, and then after¦87054 his¦87059 father¦87058 died, he moved again to this land where we now live.
\v 5 \x + \xo 7:5: \xt Gen 12:7; 13:15; 15:18; 17:8.\x*Abraham hadn't received any land here as an inheritance¦87083, in fact he'd never been near this land and nor did he have any children¦87110, yet God promised¦87091 to give¦87093 the \add entire\add* country to him and his¦87103 descendants¦87102.
\v 6 \x + \xo 7:6-7: \xt Gen 15:13-14.\x*And yet God \add also\add* told him¦87124 that his¦87124 descendants¦87122 would end up staying in another¦87128 country where they would be enslaved¦87130 and mistreated¦87134 for four¦87137 hundred¦87137 years¦87136.
\v 7 \x + \xo 7:7: \xt Exo 3:12.\x*However God promised to punish the nation¦87141 that enslaved them and told him that in the end, they would leave that place¦87163 and serve¦87145 him here in this country.
\v 8 \x + \xo 7:8: a \xt Gen 17:10-14; \xo b \xt Gen 21:2-4; \xo c \xt Gen 25:26; \xo d \xt Gen 29:31–35:18.\x*And he contracted with Abraham about being circumcised, and so when he had Isaac, he circumcised him on the eighth¦87182 day¦87179, and then Isaac went on to have Jacob, and Jacob to have the \add twelve\add* tribal leaders.
\p
\v 9 \x + \xo 7:9: a \xt Gen 37:11; \xo b \xt Gen 37:28; \xo c \xt Gen 39:2,21.\x*Those brothers went on to become jealous¦87197 of Joseph and sent him back into Egypt \add as a slave\add*, but God was with him
\v 10 \x + \xo 7:10: \xt Gen 41:39-41.\x*and rescued¦87210 him out of all his¦87217 troubles there. Then God gave¦87219 him wisdom¦87224 and caused him to gain the favour¦87221 of Pharaoh, the king¦87228 of Egypt, who then appointed¦87231 him as the ruler of all Egypt and over Pharaoh's own household¦87240.
\v 11 \x + \xo 7:11: \xt Gen 42:1-2.\x*Then a famine¦87245 hit all Egypt and Canaan causing great¦87258 distress and our¦87266 ancestors were unable to find enough food.
\v 12 But Jacob heard¦87267 that grain¦87272 was available in Egypt, so first¦87285, he¦87280 sent¦87278 off our¦87284 tribal leaders.
\v 13 \x + \xo 7:13: a \xt Gen 45:1; \xo b \xt Gen 45:16.\x*On their¦87307 second¦87290 visit, Joseph revealed himself to them, and¦87297 so Pharaoh became¦87299 aware of Joseph's heritage.
\v 14 \x + \xo 7:14: a \xt Gen 45:9-10,17-18; \xo b \xt Gen 46:27 (LXX).\x*Then Joseph sent¦87308 for his¦87315 father¦87314 Jacob, and¦87317 all the extended family—some seventy-five¦87324 of them.
\v 15 \x + \xo 7:15: a \xt Gen 46:1-7; \xo b \xt Gen 49:33.\x*So Jacob went to Egypt, where he and the \add twelve\add* tribal leaders eventually died¦87335,
\v 16 \x + \xo 7:16: \xt Gen 23:3-16; 33:19; 50:7-13; Josh 24:32.\x*although their¦87361 bodies were moved to Shechem where they were put into the tomb¦87351 that Abraham had bought from the sons¦87360 of Hamor.

\v 17 \x + \xo 7:17-18: \xt Exo 1:7-8.\x*But as the time¦87373 limit promised¦87378 to Abraham by God was getting closer, \add our\add* people¦87386 multiplied¦87388 in Egypt
\v 18 until¦87391 another¦87395 Pharaoh ended up ruling there who had never known¦87401 Joseph.
\v 19 \x + \xo 7:19: a \xt Exo 1:10-11; \xo b \xt Exo 1:22.\x*He took advantage¦87408 of us Jews and mistreated¦87412 our¦87411 ancestors, even forcing them apart from their¦87411 own babies¦87420 so they wouldn't live¦87426.
\v 20 \x + \xo 7:20: \xt Exo 2:2.\x*Moses was born during that time¦87429 and¦87433 God considered him beautiful¦87435. He spent three¦87441 months¦87440 in his \add own\add* father's¦87446 house¦87444
\v 21 \x + \xo 7:21: \xt Exo 2:3-10.\x*before being placed outside, from where Pharaoh's¦87462 daughter¦87461 took¦87457 him and brought¦87464 him up herself¦87467 as her¦87462 own son.
\v 22 So Moses was instructed¦87471 in all the wisdom¦87477 of the Egyptians, and was a powerful¦87483 speaker and project leader.
\p
\v 23 \x + \xo 7:23-29: \xt Exo 2:11-15.\x*But when he hit forty¦87496, it entered his mind to vist his relatives, Israelis¦87509.
\v 24 When he noticed one of them being mistreated, he retaliated¦87518 and while defending the oppressed man, he struck¦87525 \add and killed\add* the Egyptian.
\v 25 He thought his¦87546 relatives would understand¦87537 that God was bringing salvation¦87549 to them via him¦87546, but¦87553 they¦87551 didn't see it that way.
\v 26 So on the following¦87559 day¦87560 when he saw two of them quarrelling¦87563, he tried to resolve the situation by saying, ‘Men, you're alll brothers¦87580. Why are you injuring¦87585 each other?’
\v 27 But the bullying one pushed¦87593 him¦87594 away and¦87601 said¦87595, ‘Who made you¦87598 the judge¦87602 over us?
\v 28 Do you want to kill¦87607 me like you killed¦87613 that Egyptian yesterday¦87614?’
\v 29 \x + \xo 7:29: \xt Exo 18:3-4.\x*When he heard that, Moses fled \add Egypt\add* and became¦87630 an exile in Midian where¦87635 he \add eventually\add* had two¦87638 sons¦87637.
\p
\v 30 \x + \xo 7:30-34: \xt Exo 3:1-10.\x*After another forty¦87647 years¦87645, he was in the wilderness¦87652 of Mount¦87654 Sinai when he saw an angel¦87657 in the flame¦87660 of a burning thorn¦87664 bush.
\v 31 Moses was amazed at the vision¦87672 when he saw it so he approached¦87674 \add the bush\add* to look more closely when he heard the voice¦87680 of the master¦87682 saying,
\v 32 ‘I am the god of your¦87694 ancestors—the god of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob.’ At that point, Moses started trembling¦87706 and was scared to go any closer to look,
\v 33 but the master¦87725 said¦87717, ‘Take off your¦87734 sandals¦87729, because the ground¦87745 you're standing on is dedicated to God.
\v 34 I have noticed the mistreatment¦87753 of my¦87756 people¦87755 in Egypt and heard¦87765 their¦87756 groaning¦87762 and so I came¦87768 down to rescue¦87769 them, so now I'm going to send¦87774 you¦87776 \add back\add* to Egypt.’
\p
\v 35 \x + \xo 7:35: \xt Exo 2:14.\x*This was the same Moses that they had previously rejected and asked who had made him ruler and judge¦87790 over them. Now God had indeed sent¦87803 him as ruler and liberator by means of the angel¦87807 that he saw in the thorn¦87813 bush.
\v 36 \x + \xo 7:36: a \xt Exo 7:3; \xo b \xt Exo 14:21; \xo c \xt Num 14:33.\x*So eventually Moses led them out of Egypt after doing miracles and signs¦87821 of God's power there, and then at the Red Sea and during the forty¦87836 years¦87835 in the wilderness¦87834.
\v 37 \x + \xo 7:37: \xt Deu 18:15,18.\x*This same Moses told Israelis that in the future God would raise up from among them another prophet¦87847 like him.
\v 38 \x + \xo 7:38: \xt Exo 19:1–20:17; Deu 5:1-33.\x*Now he was the person that \add led\add* the assembly¦87871 \add of people\add* in the wilderness¦87874, was spoken to by an angel¦87877 on Mt. Sinai, and one of our¦87889 ancestors that received¦87892 living¦87895 messages to pass on to us.
\p
\v 39 “Yet our¦87907 ancestors didn't want to obey that man, so they rejected him¦87909 and started thinking about Egypt again,
\v 40 \x + \xo 7:40: \xt Exo 32:1.\x*saying to Aaron, ‘Make some gods¦87930 for us to lead us, because we've got no idea what happened to that Moses who led us out of Egypt.’
\v 41 \x + \xo 7:41: \xt Exo 32:2-6.\x*So together they made a calf as an idol¦87963 to bring sacrifices¦87961 to, and they were pleased with what they'd achieved.
\v 42 \x + \xo 7:42-43: \xt Amos 5:25-27 (LXX).\x*But God turned¦87972 and allowed them to serve the heavenly¦87984 armies, just as the prophets¦87990 wrote,

\q1
\v 43 You turned to Molech's tent and Rephan's star¦88016 as your¦88017 gods by making images¦88023 of them to bow down to. So for that, I'll exile you all beyond¦88035 Babylon.’
\p
\v 44 \x + \xo 7:44: \xt Exo 25:9,40.\x*The tent of evidence was with our¦88046 ancestors in the wilderness¦88049—made to the pattern¦88063 that God had shown Moses.
\v 45 \x + \xo 7:45: \xt Josh 3:14-17.\x*Our¦88073 ancestors then carried that tent into the land having¦88070 inherited¦88070 it along with Joshua from the possession¦88079 of the pagans which¦88067 God drove¦88083 out ahead of them. It remained there until¦88093 the time of David

\p
\v 48 But the highest¦88124 one doesn't live in structures made by people, but as the prophet¦88134 wrote,

\v 52 Which¦88199 one of the prophets¦88201 wasn't persecuted¦88203 by your¦88207 ancestors? Even the ones that foretold¦88212 the coming of the righteous¦88218 one were killed¦88209 off by them in just the same way that you yourselves became¦88226 his¦88207 betrayers¦88222 and murderers¦88224!
\v 53 You had received¦88228 the law under the direction of angels¦88233, and¦88234 yet you didn't obey it¦88236.”
\s1 Stephen's lynching and death
\p
\v 54 When they heard that, they were raging inside and grating¦88248 their¦88250 teeth¦88251 at him¦88253.
\v 55 But being¦88254 full of the pure spirit¦88259, Stephen started up into the sky and was able to see God's splendor, as well as seing Yeshua standing there on God's right¦88274.
\v 56 He said¦88280, “I can look through the sky that's opened¦88285 up and can see mankind's child standing at God's right¦88294 side.”
\p
\v 57 At this point, they blocked their¦88305 ears¦88304 and rushed¦88307 together to grab Stephen, yelling loudly.
\v 58 They drove him out of the city¦88316 and then started throwing¦88312 rocks at him. His¦88331 accusers left their¦88326 cloaks in charge of a young¦88331 man¦88331 named¦88333 Saul.
\v 59 As Stephen was being hit by the rocks, he¦88348 called out, “Master Yeshua¦88345, receive¦88347 my¦88350 spirit¦88349.”
\v 60 Then falling to his knees¦88354, just before he died he called out loudly, “Master, don't hold this sin¦88369 against them.”
\c 8
\p
\v 1 (And Saul was agreeing that Stephen should be executed.)
\s1 Persecution of believers intensifies
\p That same day¦88388, intense persecution¦88389 began against¦88394 the assembly¦88396 in Jerusalem, and so the believers fled throughout¦88404 the regions¦88406 of Judea and Samaria¦88410, except¦88411 for the twelve who stayed.
\v 2 (Some godly men¦88423 buried¦88418 Stephen with loud wailing.)
\p
\v 3 \x + \xo 8:3: \xt Acts 22:4-5; 26:9-11.\x*As for Saul¦88433, he started on destroying the assembly¦88438 by entering¦88442 people's homes and dragging¦88443 both men and women¦88448 out and then off to prison¦88452.
\s1 Philip preaches in Samaria
\p
\v 4 However, now the people who had fled began the proclaim the good message to others in other places.
\v 5 Around the same time, Philip went to a city¦88467 in Samaria¦88470 and¦88463 told them about the messiah¦88474.
\v 6 Crowds gathered and listened carefully to Philip¦88489 and watched him do miracles—
\v 7 many demon-possessed people shouted¦88512 loudly as the demons left them, and many who were paralysed¦88520 or lame were healed¦88523
\v 8 so there were a lot of happy people there.
\s1 Simon the magician seeks power
\p
\v 9 One man¦88537 in the city¦88546 had been practicing¦88547 magic¦88547 and amazing¦88549 the people¦88553 and he claimed that he was someone¦88558 great¦88560. His name¦88540 was Simon
\v 10 and the people there from the least to the most important said, “This power is from the great god¦88575.”
\v 11 They gave him¦88581 a lot of attention because¦88582 he'd been amazing them with magic¦88587 for quite a long time¦88585.
\v 12 However when Philip started preaching¦88597 the good message about God's kingdom¦88602 and the name and authority of Yeshua the messiah¦88611, they believed¦88592 the message, and many men and women¦88616 asked to be immersed¦88612 \add in water\add*.
\v 13 Simon himself¦88621 also believed¦88622 and was immersed¦88624, and then started accompanying Philip around—marvelling¦88641 as he¦88641 observed¦88630 the miracles¦88636 and signs¦88634 of God's power.
\p
\v 14 When the ambassadors¦88649 in Jerusalem heard¦88643 that many people from Samaria¦88653 had accepted God's message¦88655, they¦88659 sent¦88659 Peter and¦88664 John out to them
\v 15 so then they prayed¦88668 for them to receive¦88672 the pure spirit¦88673.
\v 16 (The pure spirit hadn't fallen¦88683 on any of them at that point, but¦88685 they¦88687 had only been immersed¦88686 into the name¦88690 and authority of the master¦88693 Yeshua¦88694.)
\v 17 So Peter and John placed their¦88700 hands¦88701 on the new believers and they received¦88705 the pure spirit¦88706.
\p
\v 18 When Simon the magician saw that they received the spirit¦88723 after having¦88708 the hands¦88718 of the ambassadors¦88720 placed on them, he offered¦88726 money¦88729 to Peter and John, saying,
\v 19 “Give me this authority¦88736 so that whoever I place \em my\em* hands¦88745 on will receive¦88746 the pure spirit¦88747.”
\p
\v 20 But Peter responded, “May your money¦88772 join you in your destruction¦88763 because¦88764 you thought¦88769 you could buy God's gift¦88766 with it¦88761.
\v 21 There's no role for you here and no part for you in our work because your¦88788 heart¦88787 isn't right¦88791 with God.
\v 22 You need to turn away from this evil¦88801 \add desire\add* and beg the master¦88808 that maybe he'll forgive¦88812 you for your¦88803 wrong intentions¦88816
\v 23 because I perceive that you¦88832 have a bitter¦88824 attitude and and ungodly habits.
\p
\v 24 Simon answered¦88834, “Oh, please ask the master¦88851 on my behalf that none of what you¦88865 mentioned will happen to me.”
\s1 Philip immerses the Ethiopian official
\p
\v 25 After that, Peter and John continued to testify¦88875 and proclaim the good message¦88880 about the master¦88883 in many villages¦88892 around Samaria¦88894 before they returned¦88885 to Jerusalem.
\p
\v 26 Then an angel¦88897 from the master¦88899 spoke¦88900 to Philip, “Start walking and head south¦88910 on the road that goes downhill from Jerusalem to Gaza through the wilderness¦88923.”
\v 27 So he headed off, and \add on the road\add* he came across an important official¦88932 of the Ethiopia queen\f + \fr 8:27 \ft Some translations list the queen's name as ‘Candace’, but that was the name of the series of queens, cf., Pharaoh or Caesar which came to be used as a title for more than one person.\f* and was in charge of her¦88937 treasury¦88943. This man¦88929 had been in Jerusalem to worship God
\v 28 and was returning¦88955 home in his¦88961 chariot¦88960. As he rode, he was reading¦88963 \add the scroll of\add* the prophet¦88969 Isaiah,
\v 29 and the spirit¦88974 told Philip to approach him and stay by the chariot¦88981.
\v 30 So Philip ran up to the chariot and heard¦88988 the man reading from the prophet¦88993 Isaiah and asked, “Do you know what it is that you're reading about?”
\p
\v 31 “How could I know when I don't have someone¦89014 to guide me,” he answered, and so he invited Philip to climb up and sit¦89024 with him.
\v 32 Now the particular passage¦89029 that he was reading¦89033 was this:\x + \xo 8:32-33: \xt Isa 53:7-8 (LXX).\x*
\q1 ‘He was led away like a sheep¦89038 being led to the slaughterhouse¦89040,
\q1 and stayed as silent¦89052 as a lamb being shorn
\q2 so he never opened his¦89058 mouth¦89057.
\q1
\v 33 He was humiliated¦89061 by a lack of justice¦89064.
\q1 Who can name his descendants,
\q2 because his life¦89079 is being¦89074 taken from the earth¦89077?’
\p
\v 34 “Now tell me,” said¦89087 the official, “who was Isaiah talking about? Was he talking about himself¦89097 or someone¦89101 else?”
\v 35 So Philip started with that passage and explained the good¦89116 message¦89116 about Yeshua to him.
\v 36 As they were going¦89122 along¦89123 the road¦89125, they came to some water, and the official asked, “Look, here's some water. What would stop me from being immersed¦89139 here?”
\p
\v 37 ≈
\v 38 So he commanded¦89164 \add the driver\add* to stop the chariot¦89167 and they both climbed down, and Philip¦89176 immersed¦89181 the official in the water¦89173.
\v 39 But as they came out of the water¦89188, the master's¦89197 spirit¦89189 snatched¦89198 Philip¦89200 away and so the official never saw¦89203 him again, but he continued on his¦89197 journey very happy.
\v 40 As for Philip, he found¦89217 himself at \add the town of\add* Azotus, and as he passed through¦89221 \add the coastal towns\add* on the way to Caesarea, he proclaimed the good¦89222 message¦89222 in each town.
\c 9
\s1 Yeshua talks to Saul
\r (Acts 22:6-16; 26:12-18)
\p
\v 1 Meanwhile Saul was still¦89238 spouting off murderous¦89242 threats¦89240 towards¦89243 the followers¦89245 of the master¦89247. He went to the chief¦89250 priest¦89250
\v 2 and obtained \add official\add* letters¦89255 to enable him to enter the Jewish meeting halls in Damascus¦89257 so that if he found either male or female followers of Yeshua, he could arrest them and bring¦89276 them to Jerusalem in chains.
\p
\v 3 On his journey as he approached Damascus¦89287, suddenly¦89289 light¦89294 from the sky¦89299 flashed¦89293 around¦89293 him.
\v 4 He dropped to his knees and heard¦89305 a voice¦89306 calling, “Saul, Saul, why are you¦89313 persecuting¦89313 me?”
\p
\v 5 “Who are you, master¦89319?” he¦89314 asked.
\p And the voice replied, “I'm Yeshua, the one that you're persecuting¦89331.
\v 6 But stand up and go into the city¦89359, and you'll be told there what you need to do.”
\p
\v 7 Meanwhile his travelling¦89372 companions had stood¦89374 there speechless¦89375, because they had heard the voice¦89379 but couldn't see anyone.
\v 8 They helped Saul up from the ground¦89390, but even when he opened¦89393 his¦89398 eyes¦89397, he couldn't see anything. So they had to lead him into Damascus¦89407 by hand¦89402.
\v 9 Saul stayed there for three¦89411 days¦89410, unable to see and¦89414 not eating or drinking anything.
\s1 Ananias restores Saul's sight
\p
\v 10 Now there was a believer there in Damascus¦89426 named Ananias, and the master spoke to him in a vision¦89436, calling, “Ananias.”
\p “I'm here, master,” he answered.
\p
\v 11 So the master¦89448 told him¦89450, “Get up and¦89460 go to Judas' house¦89463 in Straight¦89459 Street where you'll find a man named Saul from Tarsus. He's praying¦89470 right now
\v 12 and in his vision¦89475, he saw¦89472 a man¦89473 named Ananias¦89478 who comes in and places his hands¦89486 on him so that he can receive¦89488 his sight¦89488 back.”
\p
\v 13 But Ananias¦89492 resisted, “Master, I've heard¦89495 a lot about that man¦89500, including all the evil¦89503 things he's done to your¦89507 dedicated people in Jerusalem,
\v 14 and¦89512 the reason he's here in Damascus with the authority¦89515 of the chief¦89518 priests¦89518 is to arrest everyone who trusts in you¦89525.”
\p
\v 15 But the master¦89531 said¦89526, “Go now, because¦89533 I have chosen that man¦89539 to be a bearer of my¦89544 name¦89543 and authority both in other countries, even to their¦89544 kings¦89550, and to the descendants of Israel,
\v 16 because I'll be showing¦89556 him what he's going to have to suffer¦89565 for bearing my¦89564 name¦89563.”
\p
\v 17 So Ananias¦89569 left and went¦89566 into Judas' house¦89574 where he placed his hands¦89580 on Saul and said¦89583, “Brother Saul, the master¦89587 has sent¦89588 me here—Yeshua the one you saw on the road¦89596 when you were coming¦89598 here—so that you will be able to see again and also be filled¦89603 with the pure spirit¦89604.”
\v 18 Immediately something¦89608 like scales¦89617 fell off his¦89610 eyes¦89613 and he was able to see again, and he got up and got immersed¦89626 in water,
\v 19 before getting something to eat to renew his strength¦89631.
\s1 Saul starts preaching in Damascus
\p Then Saul stayed several days¦89641 with the believers in Damascus¦89639.
\v 20 He went straight into the Jewish meeting halls and started proclaiming¦89649 that Yeshua¦89651 is God's son.
\p
\v 21 The hearers were all amazed, saying¦89668, “Isn't this the guy that persecuted¦89673 the ones following that Yeshua in Jerusalem, and even came to Damascus to arrest them here and take them back to the chief¦89696 priests¦89696?”
\p
\v 22 But Saul was growing stronger\f + \fr 9:22 \ft It's not clear here whether it means that Saul was growing physically stronger, or that his preaching and debating skills were improving.\f* and he was confounding¦89704 the Jews living in Damascus¦89711 as he taught them that Yeshua is the \add promised\add* messiah¦89717.
\p
\v 23 \x + \xo 9:23-25: \xt 2Cor 11:32-33.\x*After several days¦89721, the religious Jews plotted¦89723 together¦89723 to kill¦89726 him¦89727,
\v 24 but Saul found out about their¦89735 plan. Those Jews were also watching¦89737 the city exits so they could kill¦89752 him if he tried leaving,
\v 25 but his¦89758 supporters took him to the city wall at night¦89759 time and lowered¦89767 him down in a basket¦89769.
\s1 Saul goes to Jerusalem but has to leave
\p
\v 26 When he got back to Jerusalem, Saul attempted¦89779 to join in with the believers¦89789 there but they were all scared of him, not believing¦89789 that he was a true follower¦89792 of Yeshua.
\v 27 However Barnabas¦89793 took Saul and brought¦89797 him to the twelve, and Saul told them how he had seen the master¦89810 on the road¦89807, and been spoken to by him, and how he had spoken boldy in Damascus¦89818 in the name¦89822 and authority of Yeshua.
\v 28 So Saul stayed connected with the believers, going¦89832 in and out of Jerusalem and speaking¦89838 boldly¦89838 in the name¦89841 and authority of the master¦89843.
\v 29 He also talked and¦89847 debated¦89848 with the Greek-speaking Jews, but¦89855 they¦89854 wanted to kill¦89858 him¦89859,
\v 30 so when the brothers¦89864 found out, they took Saul down to Caesarea \add on the coast\add*, and from there sent¦89871 him \add on a ship\add* to Tarsus.
\p
\v 31 After that the assembly¦89881 of believers throughout Judea and Galilee¦89887 and Samaria¦89889 had peace¦89892 and grew in their¦89901 respect and service of the master¦89902, also well as increasing in numbers through the encouragement of the pure spirit¦89908.
\s1 Peter heals Aeneas
\p
\v 32 Peter travelled around the country and then went to visit the dedicated believers in Lydda.
\v 33 He saw a paralysed¦89944 man¦89930 named Aeneas¦89934 who'd spent eight¦89937 years¦89936 lying¦89938 on his pallet¦89941,
\v 34 and said¦89946 to him¦89947, “Aeneas, Yeshua¦89955 the messiah¦89957 is healing¦89951 you¦89952. Stand up and pack up your bed.” And straight away Aeneas stood up
\v 35 and all the people living in Lydda and Sharon who saw¦89966 him¦89969 turned¦89981 to the master¦89984.
\s1 Peter brings Tabitha back to life
\p
\v 36 Then in Joppa there was a believer named Tabitha (or Dorcas if translated) and¦90003 she¦90006 did a lot of good¦90002 things as well as being generous to the poor.
\v 37 Around that time she¦90014 got sick and died. After washing her¦90018 body, they¦90019 placed it¦90007 in an upper¦90023 room,
\v 38 and since Joppa was near Lydda and the believers had heard¦90034 that Peter was there, they¦90040 quickly sent¦90040 two¦90041 men¦90042 to request, “Please come as soon as possible.”
\v 39 So Peter went with them, and when they arrived¦90060 in Joppa they took him up to the room. All the widows¦90072 stood¦90068 there, sobbing and showing¦90075 him various clothes¦90078 that Tabitha had made for them.
\v 40 But Peter had them all removed from the room, and then kneeling down he prayed¦90105 before turning back to the body¦90110 and said¦90111, “Tabitha, get up.” Then she opened¦90116 her¦90119 eyes¦90118, and seeing Peter there she sat¦90124 up.
\v 41 Peter helped her to stand up, then he called¦90133 the believers and the widows¦90139, and presented¦90143 the live Tabitha to them.
\v 42 News of this spread throughout¦90149 Joppa¦90152 and¦90153 many people there believed¦90155 in the master¦90159.
\v 43 So Peter stayed on there for quite a few days¦90163, living with a tanner¦90173 of hides named Simon.
\c 10
\s1 Peter and Cornelius each hear from God
\p
\v 1 Just up in Caesarea there was a Roman army commander named Cornelius (leader of the ‘Italian Regiment’)
\v 2 who, along with all his household¦90198, worshipped God and obeyed his laws. He gave to the poor and regularly asked God for help.
\v 3 One afternoon around 3pm he had a vision¦90214 where he clearly¦90215 saw¦90212 an angel¦90223 of God come¦90226 into the house and spoke, “Cornelius.”
\p
\v 4 Cornelius was scared and looked¦90235 intently¦90235 and asked, “What is it, master¦90243?”
\p “Your¦90249 prayers¦90248 and your¦90249 helping the poor rose up to God's notice and attention,” he said.
\v 5 “Now, send some messengers to Joppa to go and find a man there named Simon Peter.
\v 6 He's staying with Simon¦90282 the tanner¦90284 whose¦90285 house¦90288 is by the sea¦90290.”
\v 7 So as soon as the angel¦90302 left, Cornelius called¦90308 two¦90309 of his house¦90311 servants¦90311 and¦90313 a godly soldier¦90314 from his bodyguard,
\v 8 and¦90319 after explaining¦90320 the task to them, he¦90326 sent¦90326 them off to Joppa¦90330.
\p
\v 9 The next day¦90331 as they were approaching the town, Peter¦90342 went¦90341 up onto the flat roof of the house¦90345 around midday to pray.
\v 10 But he felt hungry¦90354 and wanted something to eat, but while it was still being prepared¦90358 he fell into a trance¦90368
\v 11 and saw the sky open up. Something like a sheet¦90381 was being¦90389 lowered down to the earth¦90392 by the four¦90383 corners¦90384
\v 12 and it held all kinds of animals and reptiles¦90406, as well as birds¦90411.
\v 13 Then he heard a voice¦90416 saying, “Get up Peter, and slaughter these and eat¦90423 them.”
\p
\v 14 “I can't, master¦90429,” Peter responded, “because¦90430 I've never¦90431 eaten anything that's forbidden.”
\p
\v 15 But the voice¦90439 spoke a second¦90444 time¦90444, “Don't you¦90451 be treating anything as unclean that God has made clean¦90450.”
\v 16 This vision happened three¦90459 times¦90459 and¦90460 then the sheet thing was lifted back up into the sky.
\p
\v 17 Now Peter was still there wondering what the vision¦90484 was all about when the men¦90490 sent¦90492 by Cornelius had tracked down the tanner's house¦90500 and arrived outside.
\v 18 They called out to ask if Simon Peter was staying there.
\p
\v 19 Even as Peter still continued to ponder¦90522 about¦90523 the vision¦90525, the spirit¦90530 said¦90526, “Hey, there's three¦90535 men¦90533 here looking for you¦90538.
\v 20 So get up and¦90543 go downstairs to them. Believe everything they say because¦90551 I sent¦90554 them here.”
\v 21 So he went down and asked the men¦90564, “I'm the one you're looking for, so tell me what you came here for.”
\p
\v 22 They answered, “We were sent by Cornelius who's an army commander who worships God and obeys his laws and has a good reputation with you Jewish people. A holy angel¦90613 told him¦90620 to send¦90615 for you to come to his house¦90619 so they can listen to what you have to say.”
\v 23 So Peter invited them in to stay the night.
\p The next day¦90635, Peter and¦90644 some of the believers from Joppa started out with them
\v 24 and they arrived in Caesarea the following day¦90657. Cornelius was expecting¦90671 them and had also invited some relatives¦90676 and close¦90681 friends¦90682 to join them.
\v 25 Peter entered the house and when they met, Cornelius knelt down and worshipped him.
\v 26 But Peter pulled him¦90726 up and said, “Stand up. I'm just a man¦90736 like you.”
\v 27 After greeting each other, Peter went into the main room and¦90748 found that quite a few people had gathered there.
\v 28 Then he¦90753 told them, “You all know that us Jews are forbidden by our laws to associate with or to enter the house of a non-Jew. However, God showed¦90780 me that it's not right to treat other¦90771 people as being¦90767 lesser or undesirable.
\v 29 That's why I came¦90790 without any reservations when you sent for me. But I'm still waiting to know what you all want from me?”
\p
\v 30 So Cornelius answered, “I was praying¦90825 in my¦90829 house¦90828 three days ago in the middle of the afternoon when I suddenly saw a man¦90832 in shining¦90839 clothes¦90838 standing in front of me
\v 31 and he said, ‘Your prayer¦90848 has been heard, Cornelius, and God has noticed your¦90845 gifts to the poor.
\v 32 Now he wants you to send¦90860 messengers to get Simon, the one called¦90868 Peter, from Joppa where he's living by the sea¦90882 in Simon the tanner's¦90878 house¦90874.’
\v 33 I did that straight away and you kindly came here, so now we're all here in God's \add sight\add* to find out everything that the master¦90928 has commanded¦90922 you to say.”
\s1 Peter's talk in Caesarea
\p
\v 34 So Peter spoke up and said¦90937, “Honestly, I'm still just realising that God doesn't favour¦90945 only certain people\x + \xo 10:34: \xt Deu 10:17.\x*,
\v 35 but he¦90952 accepts¦90958 people from any nation¦90951 as long as they honour and obey him.
\v 36 He sent us a message through the descendants of Israel—a good message that teaches that we can have peace¦90972 through Yeshua the messiah¦90975—everyone's master¦90979.
\v 37 And you all know the news that started in Galilee¦90995 and spread through¦90986 all Judea after¦90996 the time of John's teaching and ministry of immersion¦90998—
\v 38 how God filled Yeshua¦91002 from Nazareth¦91005 with the pure spirit¦91012 and with power¦91016, and who then went around doing¦91022 good¦91022 and heaing all those oppressed¦91027 by the devil¦91031, because¦91032 God was with him.
\v 39 We are witnesses¦91043 of all the things¦91045 he did in the Jewish provinces and in Jerusalem, and then how he was executed by them on a stake¦91063.
\v 40 Then God brought him back to life on the third¦91072 day¦91074 and sent him where he¦91070 could be seen,
\v 41 not by all the people¦91085, but to the witnesses¦91087 that God had previously¦91089 appointed¦91089—to us who ate¦91096 with him and drank¦91099 with him after¦91103 he'd been raised from the dead¦91108.
\v 42 He commanded¦91113 us to tell the people¦91117, and to testify¦91119 that he is the one who God has designated¦91125 to be the judge¦91129 of the living¦91130 and the dead¦91132.
\v 43 \add The writings of\add* all the prophets¦91136 point towards him, and everyone¦91145 who believes¦91147 \add that he's God\add* can have their¦91144 sins¦91139 forgiven¦91138 by his¦91144 authority.”
\s1 God's spirit enters non-Jews
\p
\v 44 While Peter¦91153 was still¦91150 speaking¦91151, the pure spirit¦91160 came down onto everyone who was listening.
\v 45 The Jewish believers¦91174 who had come with Peter were astonished that the gift¦91187 of the pure spirit¦91190 had been poured¦91193 out even on non-Jews
\v 46 as they¦91194 heard them speaking¦91197 in other languages and¦91199 magnifying¦91200 God. Then Peter said,
\v 47 “Surely¦91209 no one could argue against them getting immersed¦91219 in water¦91211 now that they've received¦91227 the pure spirit¦91224 just like we¦91232 did?”
\v 48 So with the authority of Yeshua the messiah¦91246, he¦91241 commanded¦91234 for them to be immersed¦91247 \add in water\add*.
\c 11
\s1 Peter explains everything to those in Jerusalem
\p
\v 1 Soon the ambassadors¦91264 and¦91266 other believers in Judea heard¦91259 that non-Jews had also accepted God's message¦91286,
\v 2 but when Peter went¦91295 to Jerusalem, the strict Jewish believers were upset with him¦91338,
\v 3 saying¦91342 that he had gone into the home of uncircumcised¦91348 pagans and¦91351 \add even\add* eaten with them.
\p
\v 4 But Peter¦91359 started explaining¦91360 from the beginning,
\v 5 “I was staying in Joppa, and as I was praying¦91371 I saw¦91373 a vision¦91376 of an object¦91379 like a linen¦91382 sheet¦91382 coming¦91377 down, as if it was being¦91387 let down out of the sky by its four¦91384 corners¦91386. As it came¦91393 down to me
\v 6 I looked¦91399 at it and saw¦91402 animals, even wild animals, and reptiles¦91412 and birds¦91415.
\v 7 I also heard¦91419 a voice¦91422 telling me, ‘Peter, get up and slaughter these and eat¦91432 them.’
\v 8 But I said¦91433, ‘Master, I can't because¦91438 I've never¦91444 eaten anything that's forbidden.’
\v 9 But the voice¦91454 from the sky spoke again, ‘Don't you¦91467 be treating anything as unclean that God has made clean¦91466.’
\v 10 This happened three¦91474 times¦91474, and¦91475 then it was pulled¦91477 up again¦91478 into the sky.
\v 11 Next minute there were three¦91486 men¦91487 at the house¦91492 where I was staying \add saying\add* that they had been sent¦91497 from Caesarea to fetch me,
\v 12 and the spirit¦91507 told me to go with them without questioning anything they said. These six¦91521 other believers went with me, and we¦91525 arrived at the house¦91528 of the man¦91530.
\v 13 He told us how he'd seen an angel¦91538 standing there in his¦91542 house¦91541 and who'd told him¦91542, ‘Send messengers to Joppa to fetch Simon, the one called¦91556 Peter,
\v 14 and he¦91570 will explain to you how you and all your¦91572 household¦91571 can be saved¦91566.’
\v 15 Then when I started speaking¦91578 to them, the pure spirit¦91583 came down on then just like it¦91583 had happened to us previously.
\v 16 That reminded¦91596 me of the words of the master¦91602 when he told us, ‘John submerged people using water¦91608, but you all will be submerged by the pure spirit¦91613.
\v 17 Therefore¦91617 if God gave¦91621 the same¦91619 gift¦91620 to them that he'd given to us when we'd believed¦91629 in the master¦91632 Yeshua the messiah¦91634, what authority did I have to contradict God?’ ”
\p
\v 18 When the group heard¦91652 all this, they had no objections and they praised God, saying¦91662, “It seems that God has also allowed the pagans¦91667 to repent¦91671 and live.”
\s1 Many in Antioch become believers
\p
\v 19 Over time, due to the persecution that began with Stephen's killing, the ones who had moved away went as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch¦91696, but they only shared Yeshua's teaching with other Jews.
\v 20 However, some of the believers were from Cyprus and Cyrene, and when they got to Antioch¦91721 they proclaimed the good¦91729 news from the master¦91731 Yeshua¦91732 to the Greeks.
\v 21 And the master caused their efforts to prosper, so a large number¦91743 of Greeks believed¦91745 and decided to follow the master.
\p
\v 22 News about this reached the assembly¦91758 in Jerusalem, so they¦91767 sent¦91767 Barnabas¦91768 to Antioch¦91772.
\v 23 When he arrived¦91775 and saw how God's grace¦91779 \add was spreading\add*, he was elated¦91783 and encouraged them all to earnestly continue to follow the master¦91794.
\v 24 Barnabas was good¦91799 man¦91797 and full of the pure spirit¦91802 and full of faith¦91805 \add in God\add*, and a large¦91809 number of people decided to follow Yeshua.
\p
\v 25 So Barnabas went to Tarsus to look for Saul,
\v 26 and when he found¦91831 him, he brought¦91834 him back to Antioch. Then for a whole¦91848 year¦91847 they met with the assembly¦91853 and \add regularly\add* taught a large¦91858 crowd¦91857. It was there in Antioch that the believers were first¦91863 called Christians.
\p
\v 27 In those days¦91883, some prophets¦91887 from Jerusalem went to Antioch¦91889,
\v 28 and one of them named Agabus when he was prompted by the spirit¦91910, stood¦91898 up and predicted that the world¦91920 would experience a severe famine¦91911 (and this happened \add later\add* during¦91925 the reign of Claudius).
\v 29 The believers decided to send¦91944 assistance to their¦91941 fellow¦91950 believers who lived in Judea¦91949—each one according to his¦91941 means—
\v 30 and so they¦91955 did, sending their contributions with Barnabus¦91962 and Saul¦91964 to take to the elders¦91959.
\c 12
\s1 Persecution of believers restarts
\p
\v 1 Around that time¦91970, King Herod \add Agrippa\add* used his power to mistreat¦91980 some of the believers from the assembly¦91985,
\v 2 and he had Jacob, the brother¦91994 of John, executed using a sword¦91997.
\v 3 Then when he saw that it pleased¦92002 the Jewish religious leaders, he went on to seize Peter during the Feast of Flat Bread.
\v 4 After being arrested¦92025, Peter was put in prison¦92029 where he was guarded¦92036 by four squads¦92034 of four soldiers¦92035 each. After the Passover Feast, Herod planned to display Peter to the people¦92046.
\v 5 But while he was being¦92051 held in prison¦92054, those in the assembly¦92070 were earnestly¦92062 asking God¦92050 to help him.
\s1 An angel leads Peter out of prison
\p
\v 6 Herod planned to send for Peter later that evening, but meanwhile Peter had fallen¦92095 asleep¦92095 chained with two chains between¦92096 two soldiers¦92098. There were also prison¦92113 guards¦92102 at the door¦92109
\v 7 but an angel of the master¦92117 \add suddenly appeared\add* standing by Peter and light¦92122 radiated through the prison¦92127 cell. The angel poked Peter in the side to wake him up, saying¦92137, “Quickly, get up!” The chains¦92146 fell off his¦92134 wrists
\v 8 and the angel said, “Get dressed and put on your sandals¦92164,” so he did. Then the angel said, “Now put on your coat and follow¦92177 me.”
\v 9 So Peter followed¦92181 the angel¦92194 out of the cell, not really knowing if it was real or he was still dreaming.
\v 10 They went past the first¦92202 guard¦92203 and then the second¦92205, and then came to the iron gate which¦92219 led out of the prison into the city¦92218. The gate opened¦92221 by itself and they went out onto the street, then at the end of the street the angel¦92240 suddenly left him.
\p
\v 11 By now Peter was fully awake and said¦92251 to himself¦92249, “Now I know that the master¦92259 really did send his¦92262 angel¦92261 to rescue¦92264 me from Herod and from the plans of the Jewish leaders.”
\p
\v 12 Now that he realised this, he went to Mary's house¦92285 (the mother¦92289 of John Mark) where¦92295 many believers had met to pray.
\v 13 He knocked¦92301 at the door¦92308 in the fence and a servant¦92313 girl¦92313 named Rhoda¦92317 came out to see who it was.
\v 14 But when she recognised¦92320 Peter's voice¦92322, she was so excited that she forgot about opening the door, but ran back inside to tell everyone that Peter was standing out there.
\v 15 They told her that she must be raving¦92352 mad, but she insisted¦92355 it was true, but they said¦92350 that it must be his¦92369 angel¦92366.
\p
\v 16 Meanwhile Peter¦92372 continued¦92373 knocking¦92374, and when they eventually opened¦92376 the outer door they saw¦92379 that it¦92376 was him¦92382 and they were amazed.
\v 17 But Peter signalled them with his hand¦92391 to be quiet, and then he explained how the master¦92403 had led him out of the prison¦92408, and instructed them, “Tell this to Jacob and the brothers¦92416.” Then he left and went off to another¦92422 place¦92423.
\p
\v 18 Once daylight came¦92438, there¦92427 was pandemonium among¦92431 the soldiers¦92433 \add in the prison as they tried to figure out\add* what had happened to Peter¦92437.
\v 19 Then when King Herod sent for Peter and he wasn't there, the prison guarded¦92449 were interrogated and then taken away to be executed.
\p After that, Herod left Judea and went up to Caesarea to stay.
\s1 The death of Herod
\p
\v 20 Now King Herod was disputing with the people of Tyre and Sidon, and so they got together and persuaded¦92487 Blastos¦92488, a close personal servant of the king, to be their¦92499 spokesman in asking for peace¦92498 because¦92499 they were dependent on food from the king's provinces.
\p
\v 21 On the agreed day¦92514, Herod¦92516 dressed¦92517 in his royal¦92519 garments and seated on his throne, started to address¦92525 them.
\v 22 The crowd shouted out, “This¦92538 is the voice¦92538 of a god¦92537, not of a man¦92543.”
\v 23 Because he didn't attribute the honour to God, an angel¦92550 of the master¦92551 immediately¦92545 struck¦92548 him down and he stopped¦92571 breathing¦92571 as a result of a worm infestation.
\p
\v 24 Meanwhile God's message¦92574 continued to spread and¦92580 multiply¦92581.
\p
\v 25 By then Barnabas¦92582 and Saul had completed their ministry and returned to\f + \fr 12:25 \ft TD:Some manuscripts have ‘from’ here because in the next few sentences it seems that they were returned to Antioch.\f* Jerusalem taking John Mark along¦92595 with them.
\c 13
\s1 The spirit chooses Barnabas and Saul
\p
\v 1 In the assembly¦92611 at Antioch¦92607 there¦92603 were some prophets¦92612 and teachers¦92614: Barnabas¦92619, Simeon (called¦92624 Niger¦92625), Lucius frp, Cyrene, Manaen (who grew up with Herod the tetrarch), and Saul.
\v 2 One day when they were ministering¦92639 to the master¦92643 and fasting¦92645, the pure spirit¦92648 said¦92646, Appoint Barnabas¦92656 and Saul to serve me and do the work that I have called¦92664 them to.”
\v 3 So they¦92676 fasted¦92667 and prayed¦92669 and place their¦92673 hands¦92674 on the two, and then sent¦92676 them off.
\s1 The preaching of Birnabi and of Saulu there to Sipri
\p
\v 4 So Barnabas and Saul, having¦92682 been sent¦92682 by the pure spirit¦92688, went down to Seleucia¦92695 \add at the coast\add* and then sailed¦92699 for there¦92696 on to \add the island of\add* Cyprus.
\v 5 When they arrived in \add the town of\add* Salamis¦92709, they proclaimed¦92712 God's message¦92715 in the Jewish meeting halls. They also had John as their¦92718 assistant.
\s1 Sergius believes after Bar-Yeshua is blinded
\p
\v 6 They travelled around the island¦92738 and when they got to Paphos, they met a Jewish man¦92744 named Bar-Yeshua.\f + \fr 13:6 \ft The Greek form of his name was Elymas according to verse 8.\f* He was a sorcerer and false¦92748 prophet¦92748
\v 7 who was with Sergius Paulus the proconsul¦92762, an intelligent¦92766 man¦92765. Sergius sent for Barnabas¦92770 and Saul because he wanted to hear¦92777 God's message¦92779 from them,
\v 8 but the sorcerer opposed them and tried to prevent Sergius¦92785 from believing.
\v 9 So then Saul (the \add Roman\add* form of his name was Paul¦92809), filled¦92810 with the pure spirit¦92811 looked¦92814 intently¦92814 at Bar-Yeshua
\v 10 and said¦92817, “You're full of all kinds of deceit¦92821 and fraud¦92825 you child of the devil¦92828. Will you never stop twisting the truth about following the master¦92838?
\v 11 Well, look here! The master¦92848 will extend his power against you and blind¦92853 you—you'll go a season¦92860 without seeing¦92855 the sun!”
\p And immediately¦92861 he could only see fog and darkness¦92873, and needed someone to guide him around¦92875 by the hand.
\v 12 The proconsul¦92882 believed¦92887 when he saw what had happened, and was amazed as he learnt about the master¦92897.
\s1 Paul and Barnabas in Pisidia
\p
\v 13 After that, Paul\f + \fr 13:13 \ft From this point on in the text, Paul is referred to by his Roman name as his ministry is largely outside of Israel. (In Israel he seemed to be better known as Saul, the Greek form of his Hebrew name Sha-ul).\f* and his companions sailed from Paphos to Perga¦92910 in Pamphylia, but John Mark left them and returned¦92918 to Jerusalem.
\v 14 Paul and his¦92949 companions, went on from Perga¦92928 to Pisidian¦92936 Antioch¦92932, where they entered the Jewish meeting hall on the Rest Day and sat¦92951 down \add with the congregation\add*.
\v 15 After the readings¦92955 from the Law and from the Prophets,\f + \fr 13:15 \ft The Hebrew Scriptures are divided into the Law, the Prophets, and the Writings.\f* the leaders¦92963 sent¦92961 a messenger over to them to ask, “Men, brothers¦92968, if you¦92976 bring any message¦92977 of encouragement for the congregation, please share it¦92982.”
\p
\v 16 So Paul¦92986 stood¦92983 up and motioning with his hand¦92990 started speaking, “Fellow Israelis and every who reveres¦92997 God, listen to me.
\v 17 The God of the people of Israel chose¦93008 our¦93006 ancestors and helped the people to prosper when they were staying in Egypt. Then later he showed his¦93006 power as he led them out
\v 18 and¦93033 sustainedXXX them in the wilderness¦93044 for around forty¦93037 years.
\v 19 Then having¦93046 overthrown seven¦93048 nations¦93047 in Caanan¦93051\x + \xo 13:19: a \xt Deu 7:1; \xo b \xt Josh 14:1.\x*, he passed¦93052 on that land as an inheritance
\v 20 after¦93070 around 450 years¦93065.
\p “Then he gave¦93072 them judges¦93073 through until¦93074 the time of the prophet¦93077 Samuel
\v 21 when they¦93079 requested¦93079 a king¦93080, and¦93081 God gave¦93082 them Saul, the son of Kish from the tribe¦93092 of Benjamin to reign for forty¦93095 years¦93094.
\v 22 After Saul was removed¦93097, God chose David to be their¦93120 king¦93105—the man of whom he said, ‘I found¦93110 David the son of Jesse, a man who wants to obey me and do everything I ask.’
\v 23 Then eventually a descendant of David arrived in Israel as promised¦93136—the saviour¦93142 Yeshua.
\v 24 Before he arrived John-the-immerser had publicly¦93145 preached to all the people¦93156 of Israel about being immersed¦93152 \add as a sign\add* of repentance¦93153.
\v 25 as John's ministry was nearing an end, he asked, ‘Who do you suspect¦93171 I am? I'm not the messiah, but he will come after¦93179 me, and I'm not \add even\add* worthy¦93185 to undo his¦93189 sandals¦93188.’
\p
\v 26 “Men, brothers¦93193, descendants¦93195 of Abraham and¦93197 others here who revere¦93202 God, the teaching about this salvation¦93211 has been sent¦93213 to us.
\v 27 The people of Jerusalem and their \add religious\add* leaders didn't recognise this \add Yeshua\add* but by their judgement¦93241 of him¦93241, they¦93242 fulfilled¦93242 the words of the prophets¦93233 that are read every¦93236 Rest Day.
\v 28 Despite not finding even one charge against him worthy of death¦93246, they requested¦93253 Pilate¦93256 to execute him.
\v 29 And when they had done all the things¦93269 that \add the prophets\add* had written¦93273 about him, they took his body down from the stake¦93288 and placed it in a burial chamber.
\v 30 But God brought him¦93298 back to life
\v 31 and his¦93325 followers who had come¦93308 to Jerusalem¦93315 from Galilee¦93313 saw him for several days¦93305 and now testify about this to the people¦93328.
\v 32 So now we¦93330 are preaching¦93332 this good¦93332 message¦93332 to you¦93331 that what God promised¦93338 to our ancestors
\v 33 has now been fulfilled¦93345 for our¦93350 descendants now that God brought Yeshua back to life just like it's written¦93370 in the second¦93372 psalm¦93368:
\q1 ‘You are my¦93375 son;
\q1 today¦93379 I have borne you.’
\m
\v 34 God brought him¦93404 back to life, and he's never going¦93408 to return¦93409 \add to the grave\add* to decay¦93411. As God said¦93413,
\q1 ‘I will give David's faithful¦93421 devout¦93418 \add things???\add* to you¦93416 all.’
\m
\v 35 So in another¦93426 psalm¦93426 God said,
\q1 ‘You won't allow your¦93433 devout¦93432 one to experience decay¦93435.’
\m
\v 36 This can't be David, because after he'd served his own generation¦93440 as God led him, he indeed died and was buried with his ancestors and his body decayed¦93455.
\v 37 On the contrary, the one who God raised¦93461 from the dead never experienced decay¦93464.
\v 38 So brothers¦93471, let it¦93467 be known¦93465 to you all that your¦93485 sins¦93479 can now be forgiven¦93477 through¦93473 this \add Yeshua\add*—the law of Moses was never able to offer you that.
\v 39 Everyone who puts their trust in \add Yeshua\add* is able to receive a clean record.
\v 40 But keep your eyes open in case something else the prophets¦93515 wrote might come¦93508 true:
\q1
\v 41 ‘Watch you scoffers¦93518, and be amazed and die because¦93526 I'm doing¦93530 something special during your¦93535 time.
\q1 Even if someone¦93543 described¦93544 it clearly to you all, you still might not believe¦93541 it.’ ”
\p
\v 42 As they¦93557 left the meeting hall after¦93564 the service, the people invited them to speak again the following Rest Day.
\v 43 But when they starting walking away, many people followed¦93578 after¦93587 Paul¦93587 and Barnabas¦93590, who then addressed¦93592 them and encouraged them to continue trusting in God's grace¦93601.
\p
\v 44 So on the following Rest Day, nearly everyone in the city¦93625 had gathered¦93626 there to hear¦93627 the message¦93633 from God.
\v 45 But the Jewish religious leaders became very jealous¦93649 when they saw the crowds¦93646 and claimed that Paul's words had slandered¦93661 God.
\v 46 But Paul¦93667 and Barnabas¦93670 responded boldly¦93662, “It was necessary¦93677 for God's message¦93682 to first¦93678 be explained in the meeting hall to all of \add the Jews\add*. But since you are rejecting that teaching, you are all judging¦93693 yourselves¦93696 to be unworthy of living forever, so instead, we will share it with the non-Jews.
\v 47 Because this is what the master¦93713 commanded¦93709 us:
\q1 ‘I have chosen you to be a light¦93719 for the pagans¦93721;
\q2 You will take salvation¦93727 to the end of the earth¦93731.’
\p
\v 48 When the non-Jews heard that, they¦93737 were very happy and were praising the master's¦93746 message¦93743, and as many as were appointed¦93751 to \add receive\add* eternal¦93754 life¦93753 believed¦93748 \add it¦93733\add*.
\p
\v 49 So from there, the master's¦93762 message¦93760 spread throughout the entire region¦93767.
\v 50 But the Jewish religious leaders¦93782 incited¦93771 some prominent¦93778 women¦93775 from the meeting halls and some from the local city¦93784 government, and they then stirred¦93786 up persecution¦93790 against¦93791 Paul¦93793 and Barnabas¦93796 and had them expelled out of their¦93803 region¦93802.
\v 51 So Paul and Barnabas just wiped their hands of that place and continued on to Iconium.
\v 52 Meanwhile the believers \add back in Pisidian Antioch\add* were full of happiness and¦93825 of the pure spirit¦93826.
\c 14
\s1 Paul and Barnabas in Iconium
\p
\v 1 A similar thing happened in Iconium. Paul and Barnabas went into the Jewish meeting hall and spoke in such as way that a lot of both Jews and Greeks believed¦93849.
\v 2 But those Jews who didn't believe got the non-Jews emotionally stirred¦93871 up to oppose the believers.
\v 3 So Paul and Barnabas ended up staying there for quite a while, and as they spoke boldly¦93899 for the master¦93903, he himself confirmed his¦93911 grace¦93910 by causing the two of them to be able to do miracles and amazing things.
\v 4 Nvertheless, the people of the city¦93931 were divided¦93924—some agreeing with the \add strict\add* Jews, and others supporting the ambassadors¦93944.
\p
\v 5 At one point, both the non-Jews and the strict Jews and their¦93964 leaders got worked up enough to come to attack them and throw¦93967 rocks to kill them.
\v 6 However, Paul and Barnabas found out about it and escaped to the Lycaonian cities¦93974 of Lystra and Derbe and the surrounding¦93983 region¦93983
\v 7 and¦93985 preached¦93987 the good¦93987 message¦93987 there¦93985.
\s1 A miracle in Lystra following by a stoning
\p
\v 8 In Lystra¦94010 there was a man¦94007 sitting¦94015 there who had been unable to use his¦94021 legs since birth.
\v 9 He was listening to Paul speaking¦94034, when Paul looked¦94039 straight at him¦94041 and¦94044 realised that the man¦94027 had the faith¦94049 to be healed¦94051.
\v 10 So in a loud¦94053 voice¦94055, Paul said¦94052, “Stand¦94065 upright onto your¦94069 feet¦94068.” And the man sprang¦94079 up and was walking¦94082 around.
\v 11 The crowd¦94086 of people who saw what Paul¦94092 had done began to shout out in Lycaonian, “These two look like men¦94103, but they're gods¦94100 that have come down to us!”
\v 12 They called Barnabas¦94113 ‘Zeus’ and Paul¦94118 ‘Hermas’ since¦94121 he was the main speaker.
\v 13 And the priest¦94133 of Zeus¦94136 wanted to sacrifice¦94160 with the crowds¦94156, so he brought¦94152 bulls¦94145 and garlands¦94148 \add of flowers\add* to the city gates¦94151 from \add the temple\add* on the path to the city.
\p
\v 14 But when the ambassadors¦94165 Barnabas¦94166 and Paul¦94168 heard¦94161 what was going on, they tore their clothes \add in dismay\add* as they rushed¦94175 out into the crowd¦94180
\v 15 shouting, “Men. Why are you doing¦94189 all these things? We are only humans¦94196 just like you all. We were bringing you the good message about abandoning these useless¦94207 \add sacrifices\add* and turning¦94209 to the living¦94215 God who made heaven¦94221 and the earth¦94224 and the sea¦94227 and everything in them.\x + \xo 14:15: \xt Exo 20:11.\x*
\v 16 In previous generations¦94238 he allowed¦94239 all the nations¦94243 to go their¦94247 own different ways¦94246,
\v 17 but he¦94273 never left himself without¦94253 evidence of himself—sending good¦94259 rains¦94263 from heaven¦94260 to give you all fruitful¦94268 seasons¦94267 with food to fill \add your stomachs\add* and happiness to fill your hearts¦94274.”
\v 18 By saying¦94279 these¦94278 things¦94278, they¦94282 were eventually just able to restrain¦94282 the people from sacrificing¦94288 to them.
\p
\v 19 But some \add strict\add* Jews came over from \add Pisidian\add* Antioch¦94306 and Iconium and were able to persuade¦94319 the crowds¦94323. They threw rocks at Paul¦94340 and dragged¦94342 him outside¦94344 the city¦94346 \add gates\add* thinking¦94347 that he was dead.
\v 20 But as the believers were standing around him, Paul got up and went back into the city¦94366, but he left again with Barnabas¦94374 the next day¦94368 and went to Derbe.
\s1 Paul and Barnabas return to the sending assembly in Antioch
\p
\v 21 They preached¦94377 the good¦94377 message¦94377 in Derbe, and after giving further training¦94389 to many of them they¦94393 returned¦94393 to Lystra and Iconium and Antioch¦94403.
\v 22 There they strengthened¦94404 the faith¦94415 of the believers, encouraging them to continue believing and¦94416 to expect that it's normal to endure a lot of suffering on the path to God's kingdom¦94428.
\v 23 They appointed some elders for \add each\add* assembly¦94436, they fasted and prayed¦94438 for the elders—asking the master¦94445 that they believed¦94448 in to look after them.
\p
\v 24 After passing through¦94451 Pisidia¦94455, they¦94456 arrived at Pamphylia
\v 25 and¦94461 after teaching the master's¦94471 message¦94469 in Perga¦94466, they¦94472 went down to \add the coastal city of\add* Attalia¦94474.
\v 26 From there¦94477, they sailed¦94478 \add back\add* to \add Syrian\add* Antioch¦94480 where the congregation had prayed for God's grace¦94485 to be with them\x + \xo 14:26: \xt 13:3.\x* for the work they had just fulfilled¦94492.
\p
\v 27 So when they arrived¦94493, they gathered¦94496 the assembly¦94499 together¦94496 and shared about what God had done with them and how he had opened¦94514 up the door¦94517 of faith¦94518 to the non-Jews.
\v 28 Then they¦94519 stayed with them there for quite a while.
\c 15
\s1 The decision from the Jerusalem elders
\p
\v 1 Then some \add people\add* came \add to Antioch\add* from Judea and were teaching the believers that according to Moses' teachings, you can't be saved¦94553 unless you've been circumcised¦94542.
\v 2 This led to no end of arguement and debate¦94561 between them and Paul¦94565 and Barnabas until it was decided that the two of them and some other¦94600 believers should go to Jerusalem to ask the ambassadors¦94608 and the elders¦94611 there about¦94618 this issue.
\p
\v 3 So indeed¦94623 the assembly¦94628 sent¦94625 the group on their way, and as they passed through¦94629 Phoenicia and Samaria¦94635, they described¦94637 how non-Jews had bcome believers and this news made the believers there¦94624 very happy.
\p
\v 4 When they arrived¦94649 in Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the assembly¦94661 and the ambassadors¦94664 and the elders¦94667, and they explained how God had used them.
\v 5 But some of the believers¦94698 who were also members of the Pharisee party¦94697 stood up and said, “It's quite proper for them to be circumcised¦94702 and to be commanded¦94704 to keep the Jewish religious laws.”
\p
\v 6 So the ambassadors¦94715 and¦94716 the elders¦94718 met separately in order to consider the matter¦94722 further.
\v 7 After a lot of debate¦94727, Peter stood¦94754 up and said, “Men, brothers¦94764, all of you here know that some time back, God chose¦94774 me to be a mouthpiece¦94782 so that the non-Jews could hear the good message and believe¦94792.
\v 8 And God who knows even people's inner thoughts, gave them the same pure spirit¦94808 as he gave us,
\v 9 and when he purified¦94824 their¦94827 minds by the faith¦94823, he didn't do anything different for them than he did for us.
\v 10 So why are you¦94831 all provoking God by putting a load on the shoulders of these believers that neither¦94842 we¦94847, nor our¦94845 ancestors, were ever able to bear?
\v 11 But we¦94858 ourselves have believed¦94858 thanks to the grace¦94853 of Yeshua¦94856 the master¦94855, and they can be saved¦94860 in just the same way.”
\p
\v 12 The whole group sat in silence¦94874, and then they listened to Barnabas¦94882 and Paul¦94885 as they described everything that God had done among¦94896 the non-Jews through them, including miracles and amazing things.
\v 13 Then while they were still silent¦94904, Jacob responded, “Men, brothers¦94912, listen to me.
\v 14 Simon Peter has told us how God first¦94918 intervened in order to select a people¦94926 for himself from among the non-Jews.
\v 15 And this actually agrees¦94934 with the message¦94937 that the prophets¦94939 recorded,
\q1
\v 16 ‘After these¦94944 things¦94944 have happened I will return¦94946,
\q1 and I will rebuild worship tent from David's time that has collapsed,
\q1 Although it was overturned¦94957, I will rebuild and restore¦94963 it,
\q1
\v 17 so that the remaining people¦94971 will want to find the master,
\q1 and also the non-Jews who cried out to me.
\q1 The master who is doing¦94990 these¦94992 things¦94992 is saying¦94987 this,
\q1
\v 18 and planned it this way from eternity¦94997.’
\p
\v 19 Because of this, my ruling is not to be troubling¦95012 the non-Jews who are turning¦95017 back to God,
\v 20 but to write¦95022 to them to keep away from anything polluted¦95028 by idols¦95030, from sexual¦95033 immorality¦95033, and from strangled¦95036 animals¦95036 and \add eating or drinking\add* blood¦95039.
\v 21 Moses' writings have been preached in every city¦95056 and are read in \add our\add* meeting halls on every Rest Day.
\s1 The letter is carried to Antioch
\p
\v 22 So the ambassadors¦95077 and elders¦95080 with all the assembly¦95084 decided to choose some men to accompany Paul¦95094 and Barnabas¦95096 to Antioch¦95091, so they chose¦95085 Judas (nicknamed Barsabbas¦95101) and Silas¦95104 who were leaders among¦95108 the believers,
\v 23 This is what they wrote: This letter is from the ambassadors¦95121 and elders¦95124, your brothers \add here in Jerusalem\add* to our non-Jewish fellow believers in Antioch¦95131 and Syria and Ciclia.
\v 24 Since¦95145 we heard¦95148 that some people who weren't sent by us came from here and disturbed¦95156 you all with their upsetting¦95159 messages¦95158,
\v 25 we unanimously agreed to select some men¦95178 to accompany our¦95186 dear \add friends\add* Barnabas¦95187 and¦95188 Paul¦95189 back.
\v 26 These are men¦95190 who have dedicated their¦95197 lives¦95195 to our¦95201 master¦95202, Yeshua¦95204 the messiah¦95205.
\v 27 So we've sent¦95209 Judas and Silas¦95213 and they'll confirm in person what we are writing.
\v 28 It seemed right to the pure spirit¦95226 and¦95230 to us to not burden¦95239 you¦95238 all with anything more than the following commands:
\v 29 you all must keep away from anything sacrificed¦95246 to idols, from \add eating or drinking\add* blood¦95248 or strangled¦95251 animals¦95251, and from sexual¦95253 immorality¦95253. You will do well if you avoid these things¦95246. Farewell.
\p
\v 30 So they were sent¦95279 off and when they arrived at Antioch¦95286, they gathered¦95288 the believers and handed¦95292 across the letter¦95294,
\v 31 and when they read it¦95295, they were very happy with the encouraging contents.
\p
\v 32 Judas and Barnabas were both prophets¦95308, and said a lot to encourage them and strengthen¦95322 \add their faith\add*.
\v 33 After they'd stayed there¦95326 for a while, the believers sent them home carrying greetings from them to the assembly \add back in Jerusalem\add*.
\p
\v 34 ≈
\v 35 But Paul¦95354 and Barnabas¦95357 stayed on there in Antioch¦95360, teaching¦95361 them and preaching¦95363 the good message along with many others¦95367.
\s1 Paul and Barnabas go separate ways
\p
\v 36 After a few days¦95376, Paul¦95382 suggested to Barnabas¦95381, “Let's go back and visit¦95386 the believers in each city¦95393 where we proclaimed¦95399 the master's¦95403 message¦95401, and see how they're doing.”
\v 37 Barnabas¦95406 agreed and wanted to take¦95411 John Mark along¦95411 with them as well,
\v 38 but Paul¦95420 didn't want to take him because he had left them in Pamphylia¦95433 instead of continuing with them in their work.
\v 39 And so it turned into such a disagreement that the two of them each went their different ways. Barnabas¦95464 took John Mark with him and¦95463 sailed to Cyprus
\v 40 while Paul¦95475 chose¦95478 Silas¦95479 and they left after being entrusted to the master's¦95485 grace¦95483 by the believers.
\v 41 They went through¦95491 Syria and¦95498 Cilicia, strengthening¦95503 the assemblies¦95505 there.
\c 16
\s1 Paul and Silas also take Timothy with them
\p
\v 1 Then Paul went to Derbe and¦95521 then on to Lystra where a believer named Timothy¦95532 lived. His¦95540 mother was a Jewish believer, but¦95539 his¦95540 father¦95538 was Greek.
\v 2 The believers in Lystra and¦95547 Iconium spoke well of Timothy
\v 3 and Paul¦95554 wanted¦95552 him to accompany them on his trip so he circumcised¦95562 him \add in advance\add* because¦95565 of the Jews in that region—everyone knew that his father¦95582 was a Greek.
\v 4 As they passed through¦95591 various towns, they explained the decision of the ambassadors¦95618 and elders¦95621 in Jerusalem¦95625 about which commands they must adhere to.
\v 5 So the assemblies¦95629 were strengthened¦95630 in this way and¦95633 their numbers¦95636 were increasing each day¦95638.
\s1 Paul's vision in Troas
\p
\v 6 From there, they¦95640 travelled through¦95640 Phrygia and¦95644 the Galatia¦95646 region¦95647, after the pure spirit¦95652 prevented them from proclaiming the message¦95656 in Asia.
\v 7 When they got to Mysia, they planned to go on into Bithynia, but Yeshua's spirit¦95682 didn't let them,
\v 8 so after leaving Mysia they¦95691 went to Troas.
\v 9 During the night¦95700, Paul¦95703 had a vision¦95696 of a Macedonian man¦95706 standing there and imploring¦95715 him¦95716, “Come on to Macedonia and help¦95724 us here.”
\v 10 So as a result of the vision¦95732, we¦95739 decided to go straight to Macedonia, concluding¦95744 that God had called¦95746 us to share the good message with them.
\s1 Lydia's enthusiasm at Philippi
\p
\v 11 From Troas we¦95767 sailed directly to Samothrace¦95769, and¦95772 then on to Neapolis the following¦95774 day¦95771.
\v 12 From there¦95780 we continued on to Philippi which¦95785 is a \add Roman\add* colony¦95795 and the capital city of the Macedonia district¦95791 where we stayed for several days.
\v 13 On the Rest Days, we went \add down\add* to the river¦95820 outside¦95814 the \add city\add* gate where¦95821 we thought people might be praying, and we spoke to the women¦95836 who had met there.
\v 14 One of them was Lydia from Thyatira who was a seller¦95842 of purple goods\f + \fr 16:14 \ft It's possible that Lydia dyed fabric and sold it, or that she actually made and sold the purple dye itself.\f* and although she already worshipped¦95846 God, the master¦95854 opened¦95855 her¦95856 mind and she readily accepted what Paul¦95863 was saying.
\v 15 So then Lydia and her¦95871 household were all \add ceremonially\add* immersed¦95866, and then she requested, “If you all consider me to be faithful¦95877 to the master¦95880, come¦95882 and stay at my¦95888 place.” So she persuaded us.
\s1 Paul and Silas get thrown into prison
\p
\v 16 One time as we were walking to the prayer¦95901 meeting, we met a female slave who was possessed by a spirit¦95906 that enabled her to tell fortunes¦95923, and thanks to that, to earn a lot of money for her masters¦95919.
\v 17 She walked along behind us and shouted out, “These¦95936 men¦95938 are slaves¦95939 of the highest¦95943 god¦95941 and they will be telling you¦95948 all how to be saved.”
\v 18 After she'd done this for several days¦95957, Paul¦95962 was so frustrated that he turned¦95964 around and spoke to the spirit¦95966 \add in her\add*, “I command¦95970 you by the authority of Yeshua the messiah¦95976 to leave her.”
\p
\v 19 But when her¦95999 masters¦95998 realised that their¦96007 profitable business¦96008 was about to come to an end, they¦96020 grabbed Paul¦96016 and Silas¦96019 and dragged¦96020 them to the authorities at the marketplace¦96023.
\v 20 They brought¦96028 them forward¦96028 to face the magistrates and¦96027 said¦96033, “These¦96035 Jews are disturbing¦96038 \add the peace\add* in our¦96040 city¦96042
\v 21 and¦96045 teaching behaviour that we as Romans can neither accept¦96055 nor practice¦96059.”
\v 22 An \add angry\add* crowd¦96067 gathered around and the magistrates ordered for Paul and Silas to have their¦96077 robes¦96079 torn off and then to be beaten with rods.
\v 23 They were severely beaten and then thrown¦96088 into prison where the officer was commanded¦96091 to keep them secure¦96096.
\v 24 Because of that, he threw them into the inner¦96112 cell and locked their¦96115 feet¦96116 in stocks¦96125.
\p
\v 25 Around midnight¦96130 Paul¦96135 and Silas¦96138 were praying¦96139 and singing¦96140 praises to God, and the other prisoners¦96149 were listening¦96143 to them.
\v 26 Suddenly there was a strong earthquake¦96152 that shook even the foundations¦96158 of the prison, and immediately¦96166 all the prison doors¦96168 opened¦96161 up and the chains of all the prisoners came loose.
\v 27 The prison officer woke up, and when he saw that all the prison doors¦96186 were open, he drew his sword¦96193 to take his own life as he figured that all the prisoners must have escaped¦96200.
\v 28 But Paul¦96210 shouted out, “Don't harm yourself¦96214! We're all still here!”
\p
\v 29 The officer called for torches, then rushed¦96226 in and knelt down trembling¦96228 in front of Paul¦96236 and Silas¦96239.
\v 30 Then he escorted them out and asked, “Masters¦96253, what do I need to do to be saved¦96259?”
\p
\v 31 “Believe¦96264 in the master¦96268 Yeshua¦96269,” they replied, “then you and your¦96277 household¦96276 can all be saved¦96272.”
\v 32 Then they explained the message¦96282 about the master¦96285 to him and all those in his¦96293 household¦96292.
\v 33 Even though it was still the middle of the night¦96303, he sponged their¦96307 wounds¦96308, and then him and his¦96319 household were all immersed¦96311 straight away.
\v 34 He took Paul and Silas up into his house¦96331 and gave them a meal, and his whole household¦96331 were happy because they now believed¦96344 in God.
\p
\v 35 The next day¦96350 the magistrates sent¦96354 officials¦96357 to tell the jailer to release Paul and Silas.
\p
\v 36 So the officer told Paul¦96397, “The magistrates \add sent these officials\add* to order¦96404 that you two to be released.”
\p
\v 37 But Paul¦96416 responded, “You mean that after publicly¦96423 beating us Roman men¦96425 without a trial, they threw us into prison¦96433 and now they want to just quietly release us.”
\p
\v 38 So the officials¦96453 reported¦96446 this back to the magistrates, and they were quite afraid¦96467 when they heard¦96470 that Paul and Silas were Roman \add citizens\add*.
\v 39 So now they came to the prison in person, and appealed¦96484 to them, and escorting them out of prison themselves, asked them to please leave the city¦96508.
\v 40 So after Paul and Silas left the prison¦96523, they went to see Lydia and after encouraging the believers there, they left.
\c 17
\s1 Jason gets in trouble in Thessalonica
\p
\v 1 After travelling¦96546 through¦96546 Amphipolis and Apollonia¦96553, Paul and Silas went to Thessalonica¦96561 where¦96562 there was a Jewish meeting hall.
\v 2 Paul's custom was to attend at the local meeting hall on the Rest Day, so he did that, and for three weekends in a row he discussed¦96584 the scriptures¦96591 with them,
\v 3 showing them how that it¦96598 \add had been written\add* that the messiah would suffer¦96599 and be killed and come back to life, and then explaining, “This Yeshua that I've been telling you¦96616 about is the messiah.”
\v 4 Some of them were persuaded¦96621 and joined¦96623 with Paul¦96625 and Silas¦96628, along with a big group of godly Greeks and quite a few prominent women¦96642.
\p
\v 5 But some of the other Jews were envious \add of them\add*, and enlisted some of the trouble-makers from the marketplaces¦96662 to form a mob. They stirred up all the people, and looking for Paul and Silas so they could bring¦96684 them out, arrived at the house¦96679 of a man named Jason.
\v 6 But when they realised that Paul and Silas weren't there, they dragged¦96693 Jason and some other believers off to the city¦96705 leaders, shouting¦96706, “Those two men who gone around upsetting¦96714 the whole world¦96713 have now come here as well,
\v 7 and Jason has welcomed¦96721 them \add into his¦96729 house\add*. They rebel against Caesar's decrees¦96728 and claim that Yeshua¦96737 is a rival king¦96732.
\v 8 So they¦96739 stirred up the crowd¦96743 and¦96744 the city¦96746 leaders with these¦96752 accusations,
\v 9 so the leaders took a heavy fine from Jason¦96759 and the others, and then released them.
\s1 Many new believers in Berea
\p
\v 10 So the believers immediately¦96768 sent¦96773 Paul¦96776 and¦96777 Silas¦96779 off during the night¦96772 to go to Berea. In Berea they also attended at the Jewish meeting hall
\v 11 and this group were more upper-class than the congregation in Thessalonica¦96800. They eagerly accepted the message¦96804 and examined¦96811 the scriptures¦96813 every¦96809 day¦96810 to check if what was being taught matched what was written there.
\v 12 Because it did, many of the people believed¦96827 including quite a few of the prominent¦96839 Greeks.
\v 13 But when the Jews from Thessalonica¦96855 found out that God's message¦96867 was also being proclaimed¦96862 by Paul¦96865 there¦96880 in Berea, they¦96876 soon turned up to agitate¦96881 and¦96882 stir the crowds¦96885.
\v 14 So the believers immediately¦96888 sent¦96895 Paul¦96894 off to the coast, but Silas¦96913 and Timothy¦96916 both stayed.
\v 15 The ones guiding Paul took him to Athens before they headed back with his instructions for Silas¦96948 and Timothy¦96951 to come¦96958 and join Paul again as soon as possible.
\s1 People of Athens like new ideas
\p
\v 16 While Paul¦96971 stayed in Athens waiting for them, he was upset in his¦96975 spirit¦96974 as he observed¦96979 how idolatrous¦96980 the people were.
\v 17 So while he stayed busy having discussions¦96984 with the Jews and other worshippers¦96994 from the meeting hall, he also spent time every¦97001 day¦97002 with whoever just happened¦97005 to be around in the marketplace¦96999.
\v 18 Some of the Epicurean and Stoic enjoyed discussing things with him, but others just mocked him, “What does this babbler¦97026 want to talk about now?”
\p But others said, “Seems that he's talking about strange¦97032 demons¦97033,” because¦97037 he was preaching¦97044 the good¦97044 message¦97044 about Yeshua and coming back to life.
\v 19 So they grabbed him and brought¦97060 him to the Aries Hill \add where the council sat\add* and asked, “Are we allowed to know¦97066 what this new teaching¦97077 that you're bringing is about?
\v 20 It seems that you¦97082 have some surprising¦97078 ideas for our¦97089 ears¦97088, so we¦97090 want to hear what it's all about.”
\v 21 (Everyone in Athens and¦97103 even visitors¦97105 often took the opportunity¦97112 either to explain or to listen to any new things.)
\p
\v 22 So Paul¦97125 stood¦97122 up in the middle of the gathering on the hill and spoke, “Men of Athens, I've noticed how you¦97139 all are very religious,
\v 23 because as I was looking around and observing¦97145 your¦97149 objects¦97148 of worship, I even discovered an altar¦97152 that was inscribed¦97157, ‘To the unknown¦97158 god¦97159.’ So without knowing¦97163 it, you already worship this God that I'm going to tell you about.
\v 24 This God who created the earth and everything in it¦97181 is the master¦97188 of heaven¦97183 and earth. He doesn't live in man-made temples¦97192
\v 25 nor can he be repaired by any human¦97200 hands¦97199 and he doesn't need to be fed. \add On the contrary\add*, he's the one who gives life¦97214 and breath¦97216 and who gives us everything that we need.
\v 26 From one man he made every¦97226 nationality¦97227 that lives across all the earth¦97238 and designated¦97239 their boundaries¦97246 and their futures.
\v 27 He made them so that they would try to discover God, and if they did search for him they might find him as he's not far from any one of us
\v 28 because
\q1 ‘We live in him and are moved¦97290 by him and exist through him.’
\m Even some of your¦97305 own poets¦97305 wrote,
\q1 ‘We are all descended¦97311 from just one.’
\m
\v 29 So since we are God's offspring, we shouldn't be putting gold¦97322 or silver¦97326 or stone¦97328 craftmanship¦97330 in the same class as the divine¦97336.
\v 30 In fact God overlooked¦97347 times¦97342 of such ignorance¦97344 in the past, but now he's informing everyone¦97360 and requiring them to repent¦97361
\v 31 because he's set a date for when he's going¦97369 to be fairly judging¦97370 the world¦97373. He's already appointed the judge who everyone can have faith¦97381 in because he brought¦97382 him back to life from the dead¦97388.
\p
\v 32 When they heard¦97389 about a dead¦97392 person coming back to life, some started mocking¦97395 but others¦97397 said¦97398, “We'd like to hear more about this from you¦97401 another time.”
\v 33 So Paul¦97410 left at that stage
\v 34 but some people joined¦97418 with him¦97420 and believed¦97421, including Dionysius who was a council member, a woman¦97431 named Damaris¦97433, and others¦97435 as well.
\c 18
\s1 Paul resides in Corinth for some time
\p
\v 1 After¦97440 this, Paul left Athens and travelled to Corinth.
\v 2 There he came across a Jew named Aquila who had been born in Pontus but who had recently¦97462 moved from Italy along with his¦97471 wife¦97470 Priscilla because¦97472 \add Emperor\add* Claudius had ordered all Jews to leave Rome. So Paul approached¦97492 them,
\v 3 and since they worked in the same¦97500 trade¦97500, he ended up staying with them and they worked together in their craft¦97515 of tent-making.
\v 4 On every¦97527 Rest Day, Paul debated in the Jewish meeting hall, and was persuading¦97538 both Jews and Greeks.
\p
\v 5 However when Silas¦97557 and¦97558 Timothy¦97560 arrived from Macedonia, Paul¦97566 was able to devote his full time to the message¦97563—demonstrating to the Jews that Yeshua is the \add promised\add* messiah¦97573.
\v 6 But when they opposed¦97583 \add the message\add* and made false accusations, he \add publicly\add* brushed \add the dust\add* off his¦97605 clothes¦97594\f + \fr 18:6 \ft In the culture, this was a demonstration that you're not responsible for their decision(s).\f* and said¦97596, “Your¦97601 future deaths are your own problem. I'm innocent \add of your guilt.\add* From now on, I'll going¦97615 to the non-Jews.”
\v 7 So Paul left there¦97622, and went to stay at the house of a man named Titus Justus who worshipped¦97635 God and whose house was next-door to the meeting hall.
\v 8 Krispo¦97645 the meeting hall leader¦97649 and all his¦97661 household¦97660 decided to follow the master¦97655, and many of the Corinthians¦97665 believed¦97651 after they heard \add the message\add* and were immersed¦97669.
\p
\v 9 Then the master¦97684 spoke to Paul¦97693 one night¦97686 in a vision¦97688, “Don't be afraid and¦97700 stay silent¦97702, but¦97698 keep¦97702 speaking¦97699 out
\v 10 because I am with you and no one can mistreat¦97714 you here because there¦97718 are many of my people¦97717 in this city¦97723.”
\v 11 So Paul stayed on for eighteen months¦97735, teaching¦97737 God's message¦97742 to the people there.
\p
\v 12 Then at the time when Gallio¦97745 was the proconsul¦97749 of Achaia, the Jews united against Paul¦97764 and¦97766 brought a case to the tribunal¦97775 against him¦97771
\v 13 saying¦97778, “This man¦97785 is going against the law by persuading¦97784 people¦97787 to be worshipping¦97788 \add his\add* God.”
\p
\v 14 But as Paul¦97794 opening¦97795 his mouth¦97797 to speak, Gallio¦97800 said¦97798 to the Jews, “I would have accepted this charge if it¦97808 was a serious wrong¦97810 or evil¦97814 crime¦97813 and¦97806 would have listened to you¦97823 Jews.
\v 15 However, since it's a question¦97828 about¦97831 a message¦97832 and names¦97834 and your own law, you all can see to it yourselves¦97841 because I don't want to get involved in judging things¦97845 like that.”
\v 16 So he sent them away from the tribunal¦97856,
\v 17 but they¦97867 grabbed Sosthenes, the leader¦97866 from the meeting hall, and beat him¦97867 up right there in front of the tribunal¦97870. But Gallio¦97876 took action to stop them.
\s1 Paul returns to Syrian Antioch
\p
\v 18 Paul¦97881 stayed on for quite a few days¦97885 after that, then he farewelled the believers and went to Cenchrea where he had his hair cut as was the custom for someone making a vow. Then taking Priscilla and Aquila with him, he sailed towards Syria.
\v 19 When they arrived¦97912 at Ephesus, he left the other two there while he went into the Jewish meeting hall and had a discussion¦97936 with the Jews there.
\v 20 They asked him¦97939 to remain¦97947 longer, but he¦97951 turned them down
\v 21 although as he gave his farewells, he said¦97957, “I'll come back here again if God wills it,” then he sailed on from Ephesus.
\p
\v 22 When he landed at Caesarea, he went \add to Jerusalem\add* and greeted¦97992 the assembly¦97994 there before continuing on to Antioch¦97997.
\v 23 He stayed there for some time¦98000 before travelling through the regions¦98008 of Galatia¦98007 and¦98009 Phrygia strengthening¦98013 \add the faith of\add* the believers \add through his teaching\add*.
\s1 Apollos teaches in Ephesus and Corinth
\p
\v 24 Meanwhile a Jewish man¦98028 named Apollos¦98021 (who had been born in \add the city of\add* Alexandria¦98024) arrived¦98030 in Ephesus. He knew the \add Hebrew\add* scriptures¦98037 well
\v 25 and had been taught about the master's¦98050 way¦98047. Being a very enthusiastic person, he started teaching¦98060 about Yeshua, even though he didn't know about being¦98052 filled with the spirit¦98054.\x + \xo 18:25: \xt 2:1-4.\x*
\v 26 So Apollos started speaking¦98075 out boldly¦98075 in the Jewish meeting hall. Priscilla and Aquila listened to him, then asked to speak¦98075 with him privately and explained¦98095 God's way¦98097 more accurately.
\v 27 Now Apollos wanted to go to Achaia, so the believers encouraged¦98142 him and sent a letter ahead of him to tell the believers there to welcome¦98148 him, so when he arrived¦98151 there, he was able to contribute¦98154 a lot to those who through God's grace¦98164 had also become believers.
\v 28 Apollos was \add also\add* able to thoroughly¦98169 refute¦98169 the arguments of the Jews and used the scriptures¦98176 to show that Yeshua¦98181 is the messiah¦98179.
\c 19
\s1 Many filled with the spirit in Ephesus
\p
\v 1 So then while Apollos¦98191 was at Corinth, Paul¦98196 travelled through¦98214 the interior regions before arriving at Ephesus. He found some followers¦98229 there,
\v 2 and asked them if they had received¦98240 the pure spirit when they had \add first\add* believed¦98241 \add in Yeshua\add*.
\p They replied, “We hadn't even heard¦98256 that there's¦98255 a pure spirit.”
\p
\v 3 “So then what were you¦98268 immmersed into?” asked Paul.
\p “With John's immersion¦98277,” they¦98269 answered.
\p
\v 4 Then Paul¦98281 said¦98278, “John immersed¦98284 people¦98288 \add in water\add* with an immersion¦98285 that went with repentance¦98286 \add from their sins\add*, but he told them to believe in the one who would follow him, that is to believe in Yeshua.”
\p
\v 5 When the followers heard¦98303 this, they¦98306 were immersed¦98306 \add in water again, this time proclaiming their faith\add* in Yeshua¦98312 the master¦98311.
\v 6 Then Paul¦98324 placed his hands¦98326 on them \add and prayed\add* and the pure spirit¦98331 came¦98329 \add down\add* onto them and they started speaking in other languages and speaking messages from God.
\v 7 There were about¦98350 twelve¦98351 men¦98349 in the group.
\p
\v 8 So Paul started going to the Jewish meeting hall and for the next three¦98366 months¦98365 he boldy discussed¦98367 and persuaded¦98369 them about God's kingdom¦98373.
\v 9 But as some of them refused to believe and became hardened¦98382 against his¦98409 teaching and started telling everyone¦98403 that the \add Yeshua\add* way¦98387 was evil¦98385, Paul stopped teaching in the meeting hall and taught the followers¦98401 at Turannos's¦98409 school¦98408 instead.
\v 10 This went on for two¦98422 years¦98421 to the point that everyone in Asia, whether Jews or Greeks, heard the message¦98438 about Yeshua.
\s1 The power of the master's message
\p
\v 11 And God was doing¦98458 incredible miracles¦98449 through Paul¦98462
\v 12 such that even if handkerchiefs¦98474 or aprons¦98477 that had touched his¦98473 skin were placed on top of any person who was sick or troubled with demons, then they would recover and the evil¦98488 spirits¦98486 would leave them.
\v 13 But some of the Jewish exorcists¦98503 going¦98500 around¦98500 attempted¦98493 to use the name¦98513 of Yeshua to drive out evil¦98511 spirits¦98509 by telling them, “I am imploring¦98520 you¦98521 all by Yeshua that Paul¦98528 preaches about.”
\v 14 Seven sons¦98545 of the Jewish chief¦98542 priest¦98542, Sceva were doing¦98550 this.
\p
\v 15 But the evil¦98587 spirit¦98585 would answer¦98581 them saying, “I know Yeshua¦98592 and¦98594 I recognise¦98597 Paul¦98596, but¦98599 who are you¦98598?”
\p
\v 16 Then the man¦98610 who had the evil¦98619 spirit¦98617 would jump on them and beat them up so they'd end up escaping¦98634 out of the house¦98638 naked¦98631 and wounded¦98633.
\v 17 When everyone in Ephesus heard about this, both Jews and Greeks were frightened, and the name¦98665 of Yeshua¦98668 the master¦98667 was being¦98663 honoured.
\v 18 Many of the people who believed¦98673 \add in Yeshua\add* came and confessed¦98676 \add their¦98681 sins\add* and wrong practices¦98680.
\v 19 Lots of the people who'd practiced¦98689 magic¦98688 brought¦98690 their¦98692 scrolls¦98693 and burnt them in front of the others. When the values of all of these were added up, it was \add huge\add*—worth around 50,000 silver¦98704 pieces.
\v 20 So that was how the master's¦98717 message¦98720 had a powerful¦98709 effect and¦98722 won over many people.
\s1 The silversmiths start a rucus in Ephesus
\p
\v 21 After all of this, Paul¦98733 decided in his spirit¦98737 that he would need to travel through¦98738 Macedonia and Achaia enroute to Jerusalem, saying, “After I've been there¦98756 a while, I will also need to go to Rome.”
\v 22 He sent¦98763 two¦98768 of his workers, Timothy¦98775 and Eratos, to Macedonia while he stayed on a bit longer in Asia \add Minor\add*.
\p
\v 23 But while he¦98798 was still there, a major disturbance¦98794 hit the Yeshua followers.
\v 24 A silversmith¦98805 named Demetrius made \add little¦98819\add* silver¦98809 shrines of Artemas¦98811 and this business¦98820 brought a tidy profit to the local craftsmen¦98816.
\v 25 Artmeas gathered all the workers¦98831 together¦98823 and told them, “Men¦98837, you¦98839 all know that our prosperity¦98846 comes from this business¦98844 of ours.
\v 26 But you've seen yourselves and heard from others that not only Ephesus, but almost¦98864 our¦98886 entire \add province of\add* Asia has become¦98887 persuaded¦98873 by this Paul¦98869 fellow, and now the crowds¦98877 are saying¦98878 that what we make are not \add real\add* gods¦98883.
\v 27 However it's not only us and our¦98911 trade¦98898 that is coming into disrepute¦98902, but the temple¦98912 of the great goddess¦98909 Artemis is considered to be useless. This could result in a loss of power for the great Artemas that all of Asia \add Minor\add* and the inhabited¦98937 world¦98937 have been worshipping¦98938.”
\p
\v 28 When the gathering heard¦98940 this, they¦98951 became very angry and¦98943 yelled out, “Artemis¦98955 of the Ephesians is great!”
\v 29 Then the \add whole\add* city¦98962 was filled¦98958 with confusion¦98965 and the people rushed¦98967 to the theatre¦98973 and grabbed Gaius and Aristarchus¦98978 from Macedonia—travelling¦98981 companions¦98981 of Paul's.
\v 30 Now Paul¦98985 wanted to go there and speak to the crowd, but the believers wouldn't let him¦98997 go.
\v 31 Also some of the Asian¦99005 leaders who were friendly¦99009 towards him, sent¦99010 messengers to him to implore¦99013 him not to go to the theatre¦99020.
\v 32 Some of the people gathered there were yelling out something, but overall it was just confusion, and¦99034 the majority of the people couldn't even tell you the reason why there were there.
\v 33 Some people in the crowd¦99047 selected Alexander the Jew and sent him forward¦99052 to speak, so he motioned with his¦99055 hand¦99064 ready to explain the situation to the people.
\v 34 But as soon as they recognised¦99071 that he was a Jew, people started yelling, “Artemis¦99091 of the Ephesians is great,” and this continued for over two¦99086 hours¦99085.
\p
\v 35 Eventually the city¦99122 administrator was able to calm the crowd¦99103 and tell them, “Men, fellow Ephesians, what person from around here doesn't know that it's Ephesus that's the temple¦99123 keeper¦99123 of the great¦99128 Artemus¦99130 and of this image¦99133 that fell down from Zeus.
\v 36 Since all of this is unquestionable¦99134, it¦99140 makes sense for everyone to calm down and¦99144 not do anything reckless¦99146.
\v 37 These men¦99152 that you¦99149 presented here haven't stolen anything from the temple¦99157, nor have they slandered¦99160 our¦99164 goddess¦99162.
\v 38 So if Demetrius¦99169 and the silver craftmen¦99177 with him¦99176 have a case against anyone¦99181,, they should bring it to the courts¦99184 and the proconsuls¦99187 and register the charges.
\v 39 But for the rest of you, if you have a grievance against others¦99192, it¦99207 needs to be settled¦99207 in a lawful¦99204 assembly¦99206,
\v 40 because we're in danger¦99210 of being charged with insurrection¦99213 about what happened today¦99216. And we would have no defence that we could respond with concerning this disorderly¦99231 gathering¦99231.” Then he told them all to go home.

\p
\v 1 After all the commotion¦99244 had died down, Paul¦99248 sent¦99245 for the believers, and after¦99239 greeting¦99256 and encouraging them, he left \add Ephesus\add* to go to Macedonia.\f + \fr 20:1 \ft As he'd already decided—see 19:21.\f*
\v 2 As he travelled through¦99264 the districts¦99268, he challenged the people there with a lot of messages, until he eventually arrived in Greece¦99280.
