\mt2 The second account by
\mt1 Luke
\mt2 commonly called
\mt1 Acts
\is1 Introduction
\is2 Author
\ip This account commonly known as \bk The Acts of the missionaries of Yeshua the Messiah\bk*, is the continuation of \bk The Good Message according to Luke\bk*, and unlike most other Bibles, the \em Open English Translation\em* places these two accounts one after the other.
\is2 This account
\ip The main purpose of this account is to tell about the actions of the first followers of Yeshua the messiah. The spirit of the master helped them to proclaim good message about him “in Yerusalem and all across \add the provinces of\add* Yudea and Samaria, and all the way to the furtherest parts of the planet” (1:8).
\ip This document has three divisions related to the expanding circles as the good message from Yeshua the messiah spread wider and wider: (1) In \bd Yerusalem\bd* where the believers start to get organised after Yeshua ascended up into the clouds; (2) the work and the message spreads wider out to all of the district of \bd Yudea\bd*; and (3) spreading more widely again around the Mediterranean Ocean and all the way to \bd Rome\bd*.
\ip It's also documented here about how God's spirit came to the believers as they were together in a room in Yerusalem at the Feast of Pentecost (fifty days after The Passover). The spirit helps and gives wisdom and strength to the believers and teachers of believers.

\s1 Introduction
\rem /s1 The Promise of the Holy Spirit
\rem /s1 Jesus Taken Up Into Heaven
\p
\v 1 \x + \xo 1:1: \xt Luk 1:1-4.\x*Dear Theophilus¦82400, I wrote my first¦82394 account¦82395 about all the things¦82398 that \nd Yeshua¦82404\nd* began¦82402 to do and¦82407 to teach¦82408
\v 2 until¦82409 the day¦82411 when he was taken¦82421 up\x + \xo 1:1: \xt Luk 24:51.\x*\add into the sky\add* after, with the help of the holy \nd spirit¦82417\nd*, having¦82413 commanded¦82413 the missionaries that he had chosen¦82420.
\s1 Yeshua, alive, tells them to wait
\p
\v 3 After the time¦82435 of his suffering¦82436, Yeshua presented¦82431 himself¦82432 to them in ways that were infallible proofs¦82440 \add that he was alive again\add*—appearing¦82445 to them and telling them about God's kingdom¦82454.
\v 4 \x + \xo 1:4: \xt Luk 24:49.\x*Once when they were together¦82458, he told them, “Don't leave Yerusalem¦82466, but wait there for what was promised¦82472 by the father¦82474, as you all have \add already\add* heard¦82476 me say.
\v 5 \x + \xo 1:5: \xt Mat 3:11; Mrk 1:8; Luk 3:16; Jn 1:33.\x*Yohan¦82484 immersed \add people\add* in water¦82487, but you all will be immersed in the holy \nd spirit¦82492\nd* in just a few days¦82504.”

\p
\v 6 So when they were \add next\add* gathered together¦82512, they asked him¦82516, “\nd Master¦82518\nd*, is this now the time when you'll be restoring¦82524 the kingdom¦82527 to Israel?”\f + \fr 1:6 \ft At the time of asking, Israelis were burdened under the rule and taxes of the Roman occupiers.\f*
\p
\v 7 But Yeshua responded to them, “You don't¦82539 need to know¦82542 the times¦82543 or seasons¦82545 \add when future events will happen\add*—it's the father¦82548 who decides all that.
\v 8 \x + \xo 1:8: \xt Mat 28:19; Mrk 16:15; Luk 24:47-48.\x*However, you all will be receiving¦82555 power¦82556 when the holy \nd spirit¦82560\nd* lands on you. Then you'll tell \add people\add* about me in Yerusalem¦82570 and all across \add the provinces of\add* Yudea and Samaria¦82577, and all the way to the furtherest parts of the planet.
\v 9 \x + \xo 1:9: \xt Mrk 16:19; Luk 24:50-51.\x*After he'd said¦82586 that and while they were still looking at him, he was lifted¦82593 up \add into the sky\add* until they could no longer see him because of the cloud\add s\add*.
\p
\v 10 As they¦82608 stood¦82618 there staring into the sky¦82611 after he'd gone, suddenly two¦82617 men¦82616 in white¦82625 clothes¦82622 were standing beside them
\v 11 and said, “You men from Galilee¦82631! Why are you still standing there looking¦82634 up at the sky? This \nd Yeshua¦82641\nd* who has been taken¦82643 up away from you into heaven will come back in the same way that you saw him go up into heaven.”

\p
\v 12 Then¦82662 they¦82660 walked down the Mount¦82664 of Olives¦82667 and returned¦82660 to Yerusalem¦82671 which was less than a kilometre away.
\v 13 \x + \xo 1:13: \xt Mat 10:2-4; Mrk 3:16-19; Luk 6:14-16.\x*They went¦82685 into the upstairs¦82684 room where¦82686 they were staying¦82688—Peter and Yohan¦82694, Yacob and Andrew¦82699, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew¦82703 and Matthew¦82705, Yacob (son of Alpheus), Simon¦82711 (the Zealot member¦82713), and Yudas (son of Yacob).
\v 14 They were united in their ongoing prayers¦82724, along with Maria¦82734 the mother¦82737 of \nd Yeshua¦82739\nd*, and his¦82744 brothers¦82743.
\p
\v 15 Then one day, Peter stood¦82751 up in the meeting of the believers¦82757 (about¦82770 120¦82772 of them) and¦82761 said¦82759,
\v 16 “Brothers¦82775, it was necessary¦82776 for the scripture¦82780 to be fulfilled¦82778, where the holy \nd spirit¦82785\nd* had spoken¦82783 previously¦82783 through David¦82790 about Yudas¦82792, the one who guided¦82795 those that arrested¦82797 \nd Yeshua¦82799\nd*
\v 17 because Yudas was one of us and¦82806 took his part in our work¦82812.
\p
\v 18 \x + \xo 1:18-19: \xt Mat 27:3-8.\x*(Yudas had bought a field with the money¦82821 he had received for his treachery, and when he had fallen down \add in that field\add*, his stomach had burst¦82828 open and his intestines¦82834 had slid out \add on the ground\add*.
\v 19 So everyone in Yerusalem¦82844 started calling¦82846 that place ‘The field of blood¦82859’.)
\p
\v 20 \x + \xo 1:20: a \xt Psa 69:25; \xo b \xt Psa 109:8.\x*Now it was written¦82860 in the scroll¦82863 of songs¦82864:
\q1 ‘Let his place become¦82865 deserted¦82869 with no one living¦82875 there,’
\m and
\q1 ‘Let another¦82884 person take¦82883 his position.’
\p
\v 21 So now it's appropriate¦82885 for one of the men¦82890 that has been with us for the whole time¦82894 that the \nd master¦82904 Yeshua¦82905\nd* was interacting with us,
\v 22 \x + \xo 1:22: a \xt Mat 3:16; Mrk 1:9; Luk 3:21; \xo b \xt Mrk 16:19; Luk 24:51.\x*from Yeshua's immersion¦82910 by Yohan¦82911 until¦82913 the day¦82915 that he was lifted up from us \add into the clouds\add*—a witness¦82920 of the resurrection¦82922—to fill this position.
\p
\v 23 So they¦82931 selected two¦82933 men: Yosef Barsabbas¦82938 (nicknamed Justus¦82941) and¦82942 Matthias¦82943.
\v 24 Then they requested¦82946, “\nd Master¦82951\nd*, you know everyone's inner thoughts, so reveal¦82954 to us which¦82955 of these¦82958 two¦82960 that you have chosen¦82956
\v 25 to take this position of service¦82972 and being an missionary—the position that Yudas¦82980 deserted to go to his own place.”
\v 26 So they drew straws and Matthias¦82999 was marked so he was chosen¦83003 to join the eleven¦83007 missionaries.

\p
\v 1 \x + \xo 2:1: \xt Lev 23:15-21; Deu 16:9-11.\x*When the Day of Pentecost actually arrived, the believers met together¦83029 in the same¦83033 room¦83033.
\v 2 Suddenly there was a noise in the sky that sounded¦83041 like a strong¦83045 wind¦83044, then it¦83048 filled¦83048 the entire¦83050 house¦83052 where¦83053 they¦83054 were sitting¦83056.
\v 3 They saw what looked like tongues¦83061 of fire¦83063 that kept dividing¦83060\f + \fr 3:1 \ft See https://www.billmounce.com/monday-with-mounce/what-%E2%80%9Cdivided-tongue%E2%80%9D-acts-2-3-0\f* and¦83064 then settling down on each one of them.
\v 4 In this way they were all filled¦83074 with the holy spirit and began¦83080 speaking in other¦83083 languages¦83084 as the spirit enabled them.
\p
\v 5 At the time, there were godly¦83104 Jews¦83102 staying¦83100 in Yerusalem¦83097 that had come from other countries¦83108 all around the world.
\v 6 When they heard this noise, lots of people¦83120 came¦83118 to investigate but they were confused¦83122 because¦83124 they heard the believers talking¦83133 in their¦83137 own languages¦83132 \add from around the world\add*.
\v 7 They were astounded¦83138 and¦83142 marvelled¦83143, asking, “Wow, aren't these¦83152 people talking¦83155 all Galileans¦83157?
\v 8 So how come we're hearing¦83161 them speak the languages¦83166 of the countries where we were born?
\v 9 There's people here from Parthia¦83173, Media¦83175, Elam, Mesopotamia¦83182, Yudea, Cappadocia¦83186, Pontus¦83187, Asia \add Minor\add*,
\v 10 Phrygia, Pamphylia, Egypt¦83195, Libya (near Cyrene), and visitors¦83207 from Rome,
\v 11 Crete, and Arabia¦83216. Some are Jews and some are non-Jews who've converted¦83212 \add to Yudaism\add*. And we¦83218 can hear¦83218 them talking¦83219 about \nd God¦83227\nd* in our¦83222 languages¦83223.”
\v 12 Everyone was amazed¦83228 and¦83231 totally puzzled, asking each other, “What's¦83242 going on here?”
\v 13 But others¦83249 scoffed¦83251 and said, “Ha, they've just had too much to drink.”
\s1 Peter's sermon
\rem /s1 Peter Preaches to a Crowd

\rem /s1 Peter's Message
\p
\v 14 So the twelve stood¦83262 up and Peter told the crowd in a loud voice¦83274, “People of Yudea and everyone staying¦83286 in Yerusalem¦83287. Listen to me so that I can explain this to you.
\v 15 This group is not drunk¦83307 like you're all thinking¦83305, because¦83311 it's still mid-morning,
\v 16 but¦83318 you're seeing what the prophet¦83325 Yoel¦83326 wrote about:
\q1
\v 17 \x + \xo 2:17-21: \xt Yoel 2:28-32 (LXX).\x*God said, ‘In the last days¦83334 I will pour out my¦83343 \nd spirit¦83342\nd* on all humanity—your children will tell of future events, your young¦83362 men will see visions¦83364, and your old men will have dreams¦83372 \add from God\add*.
\v 18 I will pour my \nd spirit¦83397\nd* out on my male and female slaves¦83380 and they¦83401 will tell of future events.
\v 19 I will do unusual things with the stars and planets, and also down on the earth¦83413 below¦83414: blood¦83415, fire¦83417, and clouds of smoke¦83420.
\v 20 I'll make the sun¦83422 go dark and the moon¦83430 go blood¦83432 red. This will happen before¦83433 the great¦83440 victorious day¦83437 of the coming of the \nd master¦83438\nd*.
\v 21 Then everyone¦83445 who relies on the name¦83451 and authority of the \nd master¦83453\nd* will be saved¦83454.’
\p
\v 22 “Fellow Israelis, listen to this account: You yourselves¦83492 know that God did miracles¦83475 through \nd Yeshua¦83462\nd* from Nazareth¦83464, and he fulfilled signs¦83479 \add from the scriptures\add*—in fact God did this right in front of you.
\v 23 \x + \xo 2:23: \xt Mat 27:35; Mrk 15:24; Luk 23:33; Jn 19:18.\x*Then as part of God's plan and foreknowledge¦83499, this Yeshua was taken to the authorities by those who didn't follow their own laws, and you¦83509 all killed¦83509 him by having him executed¦83508 on a pole.
\v 24 \x + \xo 2:24: \xt Mat 28:5-6; Mrk 16:6; Luk 24:5.\x*But \nd God¦83513\nd* released him from the agonies¦83517 of death and brought him back to life—death couldn't restrain¦83525 him.
\v 25 \x + \xo 2:25-28: \xt Psa 16:8-11 (LXX).\x*As David¦83529 wrote,
\q1 ‘I foresaw¦83536 the \nd master¦83538\nd* always being in front of me. I refuse to be afraid because¦83544 he's there on my¦83547 right¦83546.
\q1
\v 26 Because¦83552 of that, I was happy and spoke out my¦83556 praises. My¦83556 whole body lives in anticipation
\v 27 because¦83574 you will never abandon¦83576 my¦83579 soul¦83578 in Hades¦83582, nor will you allow the godly¦83586 one to decay¦83589.
\v 28 You showed me the roads to life¦83594. You fill me with gladness¦83597 because of your¦83602 presence¦83601.’
\p
\v 29 “Fellow Israelis, we can tell you¦83610 all with confidence¦83608 that our patriarch¦83613 David¦83614 both died¦83617 and was buried¦83619, and his¦83624 tomb¦83623 is still here with us today.
\v 30 \x + \xo 2:30: \xt Psa 132:11; 2Sam 7:12-13.\x*So because he was a prophet¦83633, and knowing¦83638 that \nd God¦83644\nd* has promised him to seat one of his descendants on his throne¦83663,
\v 31 he was foretelling the resurrection¦83670 of the \nd messiah¦83672\nd* who was neither¦83674 ‘abandoned¦83676 in Hades¦83683 nor did his¦83688 body decay¦83691.’
\v 32 Then \nd God¦83698\nd* raised¦83696 this \nd Yeshua¦83695\nd* back to life and we're all witnesses¦83704 of that.
\v 33 Now he's sitting at God's right¦83707 hand¦83707, and having received¦83721 the promise¦83715 of the holy \nd spirit¦83717\nd* from the father¦83724, he poured¦83725 this out which¦83727 you are all seeing¦83733 and hearing¦83735 \add today\add*.
\v 34 \x + \xo 2:34-35: \xt Psa 110:1.\x*You see, David¦83738 never went up to the heavens¦83742, but he himself¦83747 said,
\q1 ‘The master said to my master: Sit down at my right¦83757
\q1
\v 35 until¦83759 I defeat your¦83765 enemies¦83764.’
\p
\v 36 “So let all Israel know that this \nd Yeshua¦83794\nd* that you¦83796 executed¦83797 on a pole, \nd God¦83789\nd* made him¦83782 both the \nd master¦83780\nd* and¦83783 the \nd messiah¦83784\nd*.”
\rem /s1 The First Converts
\p
\v 37 When the people heard¦83803 that, they were deeply troubled and asked Peter and the other¦83823 missionaries, “What should we¦83827 do then, brothers¦83830?”
\p
\v 38 Peter responded, “Turn away \add from your sins\add* and each one of you needs to be immersed¦83842 by the authority of \nd Yeshua¦83851\nd* the \nd messiah¦83852\nd*. Then your sins will be forgiven¦83854 and you all will receive¦83860 the gift¦83862 of the holy \nd spirit¦83865\nd*,
\v 39 because that promise¦83871 is to you all and your¦83876 children¦83874 and to their descendants—to anyone who will call out to the \nd master¦83887\nd*, our¦83890 \nd God¦83889\nd*.”
\p
\v 40 Then Peter shared further teaching with them and¦83898 encouraged them to save themselves out from this corrupt generation¦83905.
\v 41 Because of that, those who welcomed¦83914 his¦83918 teaching were immersed¦83919 and about¦83929 three¦83930 thousand¦83930 people were added¦83921 to their numbers that day¦83925.
\rem /s1 The Fellowship of the Believers
\v 42 They continued listening to the teaching¦83937 of the missionaries, and in building their relationships with each other, and in breaking¦83947 bread¦83949 and praying together.

\p
\v 43 They were serious in their learning about God, and the missionaries did many miracles and signs¦83964 of God's power in Yerusalem and all the people wanted to be right with God.
\v 44 \x + \xo 2:44: \xt Acts 4:32-35.\x*All those who did believe¦83984 were united in purpose¦83988 and¦83989 had shared use of many things¦83993.
\v 45 Some sold their properties¦83997 and possessions¦84002 and divided¦84006 them among the group so that everyone had everything they needed.
\v 46 Each day¦84020 they¦84039 \add worshipped\add* together at the temple¦84027 and also went to various homes to break¦84034 bread¦84038 together. They talked about Yeshua at their mealtimes without sophistication,
\v 47 praising¦84047 \nd God¦84049\nd* and being popular with the people¦84057, and every¦84064 day¦84065 the \nd master¦84060\nd* was adding¦84061 more that were being saved¦84063.

\p
\v 1 One afternoon around 3pm, Peter and Yohan¦84084 were going¦84085 to the prayer¦84097 meeting in the temple¦84088.
\v 2 Now there was a man¦84104 who had been lame from birth, and every¦84115 day¦84116 he was placed beside a door¦84119 into the temple—an entry named ‘Beautiful¦84124 Door’. From there he could beg from the people entering¦84131 the temple.
\v 3 He saw Peter and¦84145 Yohan¦84146 about to enter¦84149 into the temple¦84152, so he asked them for a donation,
\v 4 but Peter and Yohan¦84168, looking closely at him¦84165 said¦84171, “Look at us!”
\v 5 So the man grabbed onto them, expecting¦84181 to get given something¦84182 by them.
\v 6 But Peter said¦84188, “I don't¦84197 have any silver or gold¦84196, but I'll give you what I do have. With the authority of \nd Yeshua¦84209\nd* the \nd messiah¦84210\nd* from Nazareth¦84212, \add I command you\add* to walk¦84216.”
\v 7 Then Peter grabbed¦84218 the man by the right¦84221 hand¦84222 and pulled him upwards. Immediately the man's feet¦84233 and ankles¦84238 were strengthened¦84230
\v 8 and he jumped up and stood¦84242 and started walking and went into the temple¦84252 with them, walking and skipping and praising¦84257 \nd God¦84259\nd*.
\v 9 All the people¦84265 \add there\add* saw¦84261 him¦84266 walking¦84267 and¦84268 praising¦84269 \add \add* \nd God¦84272\nd*,
\v 10 and recognising¦84273 that he was the man who usually sat \add outside\add* begging at the ‘Beautiful¦84291 Door’ of the temple¦84296, they were astonished and astounded at what had happened¦84306 to him.

\v 11 As the man clung onto Peter and Yohan¦84322, all the people¦84331 ran¦84324 to see them in Solomon's¦84345 Porch and they were really astounded¦84348.
\rem /s1 Peter Preaches in the Temple
\v 12 But when Peter saw \add the crowd\add*, he answered¦84355 their thoughts¦84372, “Fellow Israelis, why are you all puzzled about this, and why are you staring at us as if this man is walking¦84385 because of \em our\em* power¦84376 or closeness to God.”
\v 13 \x + \xo 3:13: \xt Exo 3:15.\x*The god of Abraham¦84389, Isaac¦84393, and Yacob¦84397—the god of our¦84403 fathers¦84402—gave honour to his¦84408 servant¦84407, \nd Yeshua¦84409\nd*, who you handed over \add to be killed\add* and then you rejected him when Pilate¦84424 had judged¦84426 him and wanted to release him.

\p
\v 17 So now, friends, I know that you did \add all\add* that in ignorance¦84505, just like your¦84512 leaders,
\v 18 but \add actually\add* \nd God¦84515\nd* was fulfilling¦84529 what he had had written by the prophets¦84523, that the \nd messiah¦84527\nd* should suffer¦84525.
\v 19 Because of that, \add you¦84540 all need to\add* repent¦84531 and¦84533 turn¦84535 back \add to God\add* so that your¦84540 sins¦84542 can be erased,

\v 21 \add For now\add* it¦84565 is appropriate¦84565 for heaven¦84566 to receive¦84568 him¦84588, until¦84569 the times¦84570 of restoration¦84572 of everything, which¦84574 \add again\add* \nd God¦84577\nd* has had written by the faithful prophets¦84589.
\v 22 \x + \xo 3:22: \xt Deu 18:15,18 (LXX).\x*Indeed¦84591 Moses said¦84593, ‘The \nd master¦84604\nd*, our¦84607 \nd God¦84606\nd* will raise up a prophet¦84600 for you that's like one of your¦84613 own brothers¦84611. You must listen to everything he says—whatever he tells you.

\p
\v 1 While Peter and Yohan were still talking¦84730 to the people, the chief¦84742 priests¦84742 and a temple¦84748 officer¦84746 and some people from the Sadducee sect approached¦84739 them
\v 2 because¦84757 they were very upset about what they had been teaching¦84759 the people¦84762, including preaching¦84765 that \nd Yeshua¦84769\nd* could give life to the dead¦84779.
\v 3 So they arrested¦84781 the two, and as it¦84795 was already¦84798 evening¦84797, they put them in jail¦84790 overnight.
\v 4 Despite this, many people who had heard¦84802 their message¦84804 trusted \add in Yeshua\add* and¦84806 the number¦84809 of \add families\add* who were believers¦84805 grew to around 5,000.
\p
\v 5 Then the next day¦84821, the religious leaders and the elders¦84834 and the religious teachers¦84838 gathered¦84824 together¦84824 in Yerusalem¦84841
\v 6 along with those descended¦84864 from high priests, including Annas¦84844 the current high priest¦84848 and Caiaphas¦84851 and Yohan¦84856 and Alexander¦84859.
\v 7 After \add having¦84867 Peter and Yohan brought in and\add* standing them in the middle, they¦84872 began to ask, “Under what authority did you¦84884 do this?”
\p
\v 8 Then Peter, having¦84887 been filled¦84887 with the holy \nd spirit¦84888\nd*, said¦84890 to them, “Rulers¦84893 of the people¦84895 and¦84896 elders¦84897,
\v 9 if we're being¦84903 questioned today¦84902 about a good¦84907 deed done to a man¦84908 who couldn't walk and which resulted in his healing,
\v 10 then you all need to know, and the people¦84924 of Israel should also know, that it was done under the authority and name of \nd Yeshua¦84931\nd* the \nd messiah¦84932\nd*. He was the man from Nazareth¦84934 that you executed¦84937 on a pole, but who \nd God¦84940\nd* brought back to life. It was because of his authority that this man can now stand before¦84948 you without deformity.
\v 11 \x + \xo 4:11: \xt Psa 118:22.\x*This Yeshua is:
\q1 ‘the stone¦84954 which was rejected by you¦84959 builders¦84962,
\q1 has now become¦84965 the \add vital\add* cornerstone¦84968.’
\m
\v 12 We can't be saved by anyone else, because¦84980 there's¦84984 no other¦84973 name¦84982 or authority that's been given¦84992 in the entire world under¦84987 which people¦84994 can be saved.
\p
\v 13 The assembled leaders were amazed¦85017 when they saw the boldness¦85006 of Peter and Yohan¦85008 who they knew to be illiterate¦85013, working-class men¦85012 Then they recognised¦85018 that they had been with \nd Yeshua¦85025\nd*,
\v 14 but since the man¦85030 who was no longer deformed was standing there with them, there was nothing¦85038 that they¦85039 could really accuse them of.
\v 15 So they had them removed from the room, and they asked each other,
\v 16 “What should we do with these¦85062 fellows? By now everyone in Yerusalem¦85076 has heard about the miracle they did, and we have no way to rebuff it¦85083.
\v 17 However, we have to stop it spreading¦85093 even further, so maybe we should ban them from speaking¦85107 about this name¦85110 to anyone.”
\v 18 So they called¦85121 them back in and decreed that they weren't allowed to preach or teach¦85132 under the name¦85135 of \nd Yeshua¦85137\nd* anymore.
\p
\v 19 But Peter and¦85142 Yohan¦85144 answered¦85145, “You judge \add for yourselves\add* whether¦85151 it's right¦85152 in God's eyes to listen to you¦85157 rather¦85159 than to him?
\v 20 As for us, we're not able to be silent about what we saw¦85170 and heard¦85173.”
\v 21 So after making some further¦85178 threats¦85178, the leaders sent¦85179 them off. They hadn't been able to find anything to punish¦85187 them for, because¦85199 the people¦85193 were all praising \nd God¦85198\nd* for what had happened
\v 22 \add and\add* because the man¦85209 who had miraculously recovered was over forty¦85206 years¦85202 old.

\v 23 After Peter and Yohan had been released, they went to their¦85223 own \add group\add* and told them what the chief¦85232 priests¦85232 and elders¦85235 had said¦85236.
\v 24 \x + \xo 4:24: \xt Exo 20:11; Neh 9:6; Psa 146:6.\x*When they all heard¦85240 this, they began to pray out loud to \nd God¦85252\nd*, saying, “Master¦85256, you¦85257 created heaven¦85263 and earth¦85266 and the sea¦85269, and everything in them.

\v 28 Then they did exactly what your¦85353 power and plan had already decided would happen.

\v 30 Let us experience your power to heal and do miracles and things that confirm the scriptures by means of the name¦85402 \add and authority\add* of your holy servant¦85405, \nd Yeshua¦85407\nd*.”
\p
\v 31 As they finished their¦85410 requests, the place¦85413 where they had met was shaken¦85411 and all of them were filled¦85419 with the holy \nd spirit¦85426\nd*, and they \add went out and\add* boldly proclaimed God's message¦85430.

\v 32 \x + \xo 4:32: \xt Acts 2:44-45.\x*And so the group of believers¦85443 were united in their will and attitude. No one claimed anything¦85462 to be their own, but they shared everything they had.
\v 33 The missionaries of the \nd master¦85495\nd*, \nd Yeshua¦85496\nd*, experienced great power¦85481 and proclaimed the truth about how he came back to life, and \add God's\add* favour was with them.
\v 34 None of them were lacking anything, because¦85517 any of them who owned properties¦85520 or houses¦85523 would sell them and donate the proceeds.
\v 35 They would lay them down in front of the missionaries, and from there it¦85541 was distributed¦85541 around according to what needs each person had.

\p
\v 1 But in contrast, a couple named Ananias¦85592 and Sapphira¦85596 sold a property¦85602
\v 2 but agreed together to hide some of the proceeds. So Ananias brought¦85616 a smaller amount and put it¦85624 down in front of the missionaries.
\v 3 Then Peter said¦85626, “Ananias¦85632, why has Satan¦85640 filled¦85636 your¦85643 mind¦85642 such that you would lie to the holy \nd spirit¦85647\nd* and keep aside some of the proceeds of the property¦85658?
\v 4 Wasn't it yours before it was sold? And even when it was sold, the money was still yours. Why did you decide¦85675 to handle it like this? It wasn't people¦85687 that you're lying¦85686 to, but \nd God¦85690\nd*.”
\v 5 When Ananias¦85695 heard that, he fell down and stopped¦85701 breathing¦85701. Everyone who heard about it felt very afraid,
\v 6 and the young¦85714 men¦85714 there stood up and covered¦85715 his \add body\add*, carried it out, and buried¦85719 him.
\p
\v 7 Three hours¦85724 later, Ananias' wife¦85729 came in, not knowing¦85732 anything about¦85723 what had happened.
\v 8 Peter checked, “Is it true that you¦85754 guys sold the property¦85752 for such-and-such an amount?”
\p “Yes, for that amount,” she¦85755 replied.
\p
\v 9 But Peter said¦85763 to her, “Why did the two of you agree¦85770 to test the \nd spirit¦85775\nd* of the \nd master¦85777\nd*? The guys who just buried¦85782 your¦85785 husband¦85784 are just out the door¦85789, and they'll carry you out as well.”
\v 10 Sapphira immediately¦85797 fell down in front of him¦85802 and stopped¦85804 breathing¦85804. Then the young¦85808 men¦85808 came in and found¦85809 her dead¦85812, so they took \add her body out\add* and buried¦85818 her with her husband¦85821.
\v 11 So the entire¦85828 assembly¦85830 of believers became¦85824 very afraid, along with every else who heard about these¦85837 events.

\v 12 The missionaries went on to do many miracles and amazing things, and all the people¦85854 who gathered in Solomon's¦85868 Porch had a united vision,

\v 14 and more were becoming believers¦85889 in the \nd master¦85891\nd*—big numbers of both men and women¦85896.
\v 15 Some would even bring¦85903 those who were sick¦85905 out to the side of the road, lying them on beds and mats waiting for Peter to come past so that \add even\add* his shadow¦85920 might touch them.
\v 16 More crowds were coming¦85935 from the towns around Yerusalem¦85946, bringing¦85947 those who were sick¦85948 and those tormented¦85950 by demons¦85954, and they were all getting healed¦85957.

\v 17 But the chief¦85964 priest¦85964 and his colleagues who were members of the sect of Sadducees¦85974 were filled¦85975 with jealousy¦85976 and took action
\v 18 by having the missionaries arrested¦85979 and thrown into the public¦85992 jail¦85991.
\v 19 But one of the \nd master's¦86003\nd* messengers¦86000 opened¦86009 the prison¦86015 doors¦86013 during the night¦86006 and¦86018 led them out again, saying,
\v 20 “Now go and stand in the temple¦86027 and keep telling the people¦86029 all the teaching about \add new\add* life¦86034.”
\v 21 So at dawn, having taken notice of the messenger, they went into the temple¦86044 and started teaching¦86046 \add the people there again\add*.
\p When the chief¦86051 priest¦86051 arrived¦86047 with his companions, they called together¦86060 the \add religious\add* council and also the \add political\add* council of Israel, then called for the missionaries to be brought¦86076 in from the prison¦86075.
\v 22 But when their attendants¦86086 got to the jail, they weren't there, so they returned¦86094 to the gathering and told them,
\v 23 “We found the prison¦86103 all locked up with the guards¦86112 in their positions at the doors¦86118, but¦86120 when they opened¦86119 it up, there was no one inside¦86121!”
\v 24 When they¦86126 heard¦86126 this, the officer¦86135 of the temple¦86137 and¦86138 the chief¦86140 priests¦86140 were totally puzzled as to what could have happened.
\v 25 Just then someone¦86152 came in and¦86170 told them, “Hey, the men¦86159 that you¦86161 put in prison¦86164 are in the temple¦86168—standing there teaching¦86171 the people¦86173.”
\v 26 So the temple officer¦86177 took the attendants¦86180 and went and got them, but didn't use force¦86187 because¦86190 they were afraid that the people¦86192 might start throwing rocks at them.
\p
\v 27 So they¦86200 brought¦86197 them in and stood them in front of the council¦86203, where the chief¦86209 priest¦86209 addressed them,
\v 28 \x + \xo 5:28: \xt Mat 27:25.\x*“We officially commanded¦86213 you all not to be teaching in this name¦86220 and authority. But see¦86223 here, now you have filled¦86224 Yerusalem¦86227 with your¦86230 teaching, and what's more, you're blaming us for the death of that man¦86239.”
\v 29 But Peter and¦86246 the other missionaries answered¦86242, “It's better to obey \nd God¦86254\nd* than people¦86257.
\v 30 The \nd god¦86266\nd* of our¦86269 ancestors¦86268 brought \nd Yeshua¦86271\nd* back to life after you¦86273 all handed¦86274 him¦86275 over to be hung up on a pole.
\v 31 But \nd God¦86280\nd* honoured this way-maker and saviour¦86283 by placing him¦86288 in the place of honour, to \add encourage\add* Israel to repent¦86291 and \add then\add* to forgive¦86295 their sins¦86296.
\v 32 We are witnesses¦86305 of these¦86310 messages¦86309, along with the holy \nd spirit¦86313\nd* who \nd God¦86321\nd* gave¦86319 to the ones who obey him¦86324.”
\p
\v 33 When the gathered councils heard¦86327 this, they were enraged and wanted to kill¦86333 them,
\v 34 but a certain¦86337 member¦86344 of the Pharisee¦86344 party¦86344 named Gamaliel¦86346 stood up in the council¦86342 chamber. He was a law teacher¦86347 respected by all the community, and he ordered the \add guards\add* to take them outside¦86355 for a while,
\v 35 then he said¦86363, “Fellow Israelis, think carefully about what you're planning to do with these¦86383 men¦86382.
\v 36 A while back, a man called Theudas¦86394 became¦86427 prominent, saying¦86395 that he was someone¦86397 important. Eventually about¦86410 four¦86412 hundred¦86412 others joined¦86404 him, but he was killed¦86415 and those who had followed him were dispersed¦86425 and it all came to nothing¦86429.
\v 37 A bit later on, a Galilean¦86435 man named Yudas became prominent at the time of the census and he attracted people¦86443 to him. But he also died, and all those who'd been persuaded¦86456 by him ended up being¦86456 scattered¦86458.
\v 38 So here's my advice to you¦86465 all: pull back from \add killing\add* these¦86470 men¦86469 and allow¦86472 them \add to continue\add*, because¦86479 if this teaching and goings on is man-made, it'll be overthrown,
\v 39 but if it's from God, you all won't be able to bring them down in case you find yourselves opposing God.”
\p So they were persuaded¦86521 by Gamaliel,
\v 40 and after calling¦86525 in the missionaries and having them beaten, they commanded¦86529 them not to speak¦86533 using the name¦86537 and authority of \nd Yeshua¦86539\nd* and then sent¦86541 them out.
\v 41 So the missionaries left the councils¦86552, very excited that they were considered¦86554 worthy¦86554 to be disgraced because¦86555 of Yeshua.
\v 42 After that, they¦86574 never stopped teaching¦86575 and preaching¦86577 the good¦86577 message¦86577 about \nd Yeshua¦86582\nd* the \nd messiah¦86581\nd* in the temple¦86569 and in various homes.

\v 1 However around that time when the number of Yeshua-followers were growing, some of the Greek converts starting grumbling¦86594 about the Jewish believers because¦86600 the Greek widows¦86609 were being¦86601 overlooked¦86601 in the daily¦86607 sharing \add of food and money\add*.
\v 2 So the twelve¦86619 \add missionaries\add* assembled the believers together and told them, “We're not pleased¦86629 about having to take time off \add sharing\add* the message¦86636 of \nd God¦86638\nd* to be serving¦86639 here at the \add distribution\add* tables¦86640.
\v 3 So brothers¦86648, look around you¦86652 for seven¦86656 men¦86650 who're well known to be full of \add God's\add* \nd spirit¦86658\nd* and¦86660 wisdom¦86661, so we¦86663 can appoint¦86663 them to be in charge of this part of the work.
\v 4 Then we¦86670 \add ourselves\add* can continue to pray and¦86675 share the message¦86679.”
\p
\v 5 This idea pleased¦86683 the group, so they¦86695 went ahead and chose¦86695 Stephen (a man¦86699 full of faith¦86702 and of the holy \nd spirit¦86705\nd*), Philip, Procorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas¦86717, and Nicolas (a non-Jew from Antioch¦86722 who had previously converted¦86721 to Yudaism).
\v 6 They stood¦86726 these seven up in front of the missionaries, who prayed¦86734 and¦86732 then placed their¦86737 hands¦86738 on them.
\p
\v 7 God's message¦86741 continued spreading and the number of followers in Yerusalem¦86753 was rapidly increasing, and a large number of the priests¦86759 became believers.

\v 11 So they¦86847 got some men¦86848 \add to falsely accuse Stephen\add* saying¦86849, “We heard¦86852 him¦86853 denigrating Moses and¦86861 \nd God¦86863\nd*.”
\v 12 So they stirred¦86864 up the people¦86867 and the elders¦86870 and the law teachers¦86873 and so they approached¦86875 \add Stephen\add* and arrested him and brought¦86880 him to the council¦86884 \add chambers\add*.
\v 13 There they¦86886 produced the false¦86889 witnesses¦86888 saying¦86892, “This man¦86896 won't stop spreading messages¦86903 against this holy \add temple\add* and against the law
\v 14 because¦86915 we¦86914 heard¦86914 him¦86916 saying¦86917 that that \nd Yeshua¦86919\nd* from Nazareth¦86921 will be tearing¦86923 down this building and¦86927 will be changing¦86928 the traditions that Moses¦86935 gave¦86933 to us.”
\v 15 So then the council¦86950 members looked¦86937 across at Stephen and saw that his¦86956 face \add was shining\add* like that of one \add of God's\add* messengers¦86959.

\v 1 Then the chief¦86967 priest¦86967 asked \add Stephen\add*, “Is all this true?”
\p
\v 2 \x + \xo 7:2-3: \xt Gen 12:1.\x*And he replied, “My brothers¦86981 and fathers¦86983, please listen. Our¦86992 honoured \nd God¦86986\nd* was seen¦86989 by our¦86992 ancestor Abraham¦86993 in Mesopotamia¦86997 before¦86998 he moved to Haran
\v 3 and he told him, ‘Leave your land and your relatives¦87017, and go to the place that I will show you.’
\v 4 \x + \xo 7:4: a \xt Gen 11:31; \xo b \xt Gen 12:4.\x*So he left Chaldea and moved to Haran, and then after¦87042 his¦87047 father¦87046 died, he moved again to this land where we now live.
\v 5 \x + \xo 7:5: \xt Gen 12:7; 13:15; 15:18; 17:8.\x*Abraham hadn't received any land here as an inheritance¦87071, in fact he'd never been near this land and nor did he have any children¦87098, yet God promised¦87079 to give¦87081 this \add entire\add* country to him and his¦87091 descendants¦87090.
\v 6 \x + \xo 7:6-7: \xt Gen 15:13-14.\x*And yet \nd God¦87104\nd* \add also\add* told him¦87112 that his¦87112 descendants¦87110 would end up staying in another¦87116 country where they would be enslaved¦87118 and mistreated¦87122 for four¦87125 hundred¦87125 years¦87124.
\v 7 \x + \xo 7:7: \xt Exo 3:12.\x*However \nd God¦87139\nd* promised to punish the nation¦87129 that enslaved them, and told him that in the end they would leave that place¦87151 and serve¦87133 him here in this country.
\v 8 \x + \xo 7:8: a \xt Gen 17:10-14; \xo b \xt Gen 21:2-4; \xo c \xt Gen 25:26; \xo d \xt Gen 29:31–35:18.\x*And he contracted with Abraham about being circumcised, and so when Abraham had Isaac, he circumcised him on the eighth¦87170 day¦87167, and then Isaac went on to have Yacob, and Yacob to have the \add twelve\add* tribal leaders.
\p
\v 9 \x + \xo 7:9: a \xt Gen 37:11; \xo b \xt Gen 37:28; \xo c \xt Gen 39:2,21.\x*Those brothers went on to become jealous¦87185 of Yosef and sent him back into Egypt¦87190 \add as a slave\add*, but \nd God¦87194\nd* was with him
\v 10 \x + \xo 7:10: \xt Gen 41:39-41.\x*and rescued¦87198 him out of all his¦87205 troubles there. Then God gave¦87207 him wisdom¦87212 and caused him to gain the favour¦87209 of Pharaoh, the king¦87216 of Egypt, who then appointed¦87219 him as the ruler of all Egypt and over Pharaoh's own household¦87228.
\v 11 \x + \xo 7:11: \xt Gen 42:1-2.\x*Then a famine¦87233 hit all Egypt¦87241 and Canaan causing great¦87246 distress and our¦87254 ancestors¦87253 were unable to find enough food.
\v 12 But Yacob¦87258 heard¦87255 that grain¦87260 was available in Egypt¦87264, so first¦87273, he sent¦87266 off our¦87272 tribal leaders.
\v 13 \x + \xo 7:13: a \xt Gen 45:1; \xo b \xt Gen 45:16.\x*On their second¦87278 visit, Yosef revealed himself to them, and¦87285 so Pharaoh became¦87287 aware of Yosef's heritage.
\v 14 \x + \xo 7:14: a \xt Gen 45:9-10,17-18; \xo b \xt Gen 46:27 (LXX).\x*Then Yosef sent¦87296 for his¦87303 father¦87302 Yacob¦87300 and¦87305 all the extended family—some seventy-five¦87312 of them.
\v 15 \x + \xo 7:15: a \xt Gen 46:1-7; \xo b \xt Gen 49:33.\x*So Yacob¦87319 went to Egypt¦87321, where he and the \add twelve\add* tribal leaders eventually died¦87323,
\v 16 \x + \xo 7:16: \xt Gen 23:3-16; 33:19; 50:7-13; Josh 24:32.\x*although their bodies were moved to Shechem where they were put into the tomb¦87339 that Abraham¦87343 had bought from the sons¦87348 of Hamor.
\p
\v 17 \x + \xo 7:17-18: \xt Exo 1:7-8.\x*But as the time¦87360 limit promised¦87365 to Abraham¦87370 by \nd God¦87368\nd* was getting closer, \add our\add* people¦87373 multiplied¦87375 in Egypt¦87377
\v 18 until¦87378 another¦87382 Pharaoh ended up ruling there who had never known¦87388 Yosef.
\v 19 \x + \xo 7:19: a \xt Exo 1:10-11; \xo b \xt Exo 1:22.\x*He took advantage¦87395 of us Jews and mistreated¦87399 our¦87398 ancestors¦87401, even forcing them apart from their¦87409 own babies¦87407 so they wouldn't live.
\v 20 \x + \xo 7:20: \xt Exo 2:2.\x*Moses was born during that time¦87416 and¦87420 \nd God¦87424\nd* considered him beautiful¦87422. He spent three¦87428 months¦87427 in his \add own\add* father's¦87433 house¦87431
\v 21 \x + \xo 7:21: \xt Exo 2:3-10.\x*before being placed outside, from where Pharaoh's¦87449 daughter¦87448 took¦87444 him and brought¦87451 him up herself¦87454 as her own son.
\v 22 So Moses was instructed¦87458 in all the wisdom¦87464 of the Egyptians, and was a powerful¦87470 speaker and project leader.
\p
\v 23 \x + \xo 7:23-29: \xt Exo 2:11-15.\x*But when he hit forty¦87483, it entered his mind¦87488 to visit¦87490 his relatives, the Israelis.
\v 24 When he noticed one of them being mistreated, he retaliated¦87504 and while defending the oppressed man, he struck¦87511 \add and killed\add* the Egyptian.
\v 25 He thought his¦87532 relatives would understand¦87523 that \nd God¦87529\nd* was bringing salvation¦87535 to them via him¦87532, but¦87539 they¦87537 didn't see it that way.
\v 26 So on the following¦87545 day¦87546 when he saw two of them quarrelling¦87549, he tried to resolve the situation by saying, ‘Men, you're all brothers¦87566. Why are you injuring¦87571 each other?’
\v 27 But the bullying one pushed¦87579 him¦87580 away and¦87587 said¦87581, ‘Who made you¦87584 the judge¦87588 over us?
\v 28 Do you want to kill¦87593 me like you killed¦87599 that Egyptian yesterday¦87600?’
\v 29 \x + \xo 7:29: \xt Exo 18:3-4.\x*When he heard that, Moses fled \add Egypt\add* and became¦87616 an exile in Midian where¦87621 he \add eventually\add* had two¦87624 sons¦87623.
\p
\v 30 \x + \xo 7:30-34: \xt Exo 3:1-10.\x*After another forty¦87633 years¦87631, he was in the wilderness¦87638 around Mount¦87640 Sinai when he saw a messenger¦87643 in the flame¦87646 of a burning thorn¦87650 bush.
\v 31 Moses was amazed at the vision¦87658 when he saw it, so he approached¦87660 \add the bush\add* to look more closely when he heard Yahweh's voice¦87666 saying,
\v 32 ‘I am the god of your¦87680 ancestors¦87679—the god of Abraham¦87683 and of Isaac¦87687 and of Yacob¦87691.’ At that point, Moses started trembling¦87692 and was scared to go any closer to look,
\v 33 but Yahweh said¦87703, ‘Take off your¦87720 sandals¦87715, because¦87722 the ground¦87731 you're standing on is dedicated to God.
\v 34 I have noticed the mistreatment¦87739 of my¦87742 people¦87741 in Egypt and heard¦87751 their¦87749 groaning¦87748 and so I came¦87754 down to rescue¦87755 them, so now I'm going to send¦87760 you¦87762 \add back\add* to Egypt.’
\p
\v 35 \x + \xo 7:35: \xt Exo 2:14.\x*This was the same Moses that they had previously rejected and asked who had made him ruler and judge¦87776 over them. Now \nd God¦87781\nd* had indeed sent him as ruler and liberator by means of the messenger¦87793 that he saw in the thorn¦87799 bush.
\v 36 \x + \xo 7:36: a \xt Exo 7:3; \xo b \xt Exo 14:21; \xo c \xt Num 14:33.\x*So eventually Moses led them out of Egypt¦87811 after doing miracles and signs¦87807 of God's power there, and then also at the Red Sea and during the forty years¦87821 in the wilderness¦87820.
\v 37 \x + \xo 7:37: \xt Deu 18:15,18.\x*This same Moses told Israelis that in the future \nd God¦87838\nd* would raise up another prophet¦87833 like him from among them.
\v 38 \x + \xo 7:38: \xt Exo 19:1–20:17; Deu 5:1-33.\x*Now Moses was the person that \add led\add* the assembly¦87857 \add of people\add* in the wilderness¦87860, was spoken to by one \add of God's\add* messengers¦87863 on Mt. Sinai, and¦87871 one of our¦87875 ancestors¦87873 that received¦87878 living¦87881 messages to pass on to us.
\p
\v 39 “Yet our¦87893 ancestors¦87892 didn't want to obey that man, so they rejected him¦87895 and started thinking about Egypt¦87909 again,
\v 40 \x + \xo 7:40: \xt Exo 32:1.\x*saying to Aaron, ‘Make some gods¦87916 for us to lead us because¦87915 we've got no idea what happened to that Moses who led us out of Egypt¦87931.’
\v 41 \x + \xo 7:41: \xt Exo 32:2-6.\x*So together they made a calf as an idol¦87949 to bring sacrifices¦87947 to, and they were pleased with what they'd achieved.
\v 42 \x + \xo 7:42-43: \xt Amos 5:25-27 (LXX).\x*But \nd God¦87962\nd* turned¦87958 and allowed them to serve the heavenly¦87970 armies, just as the prophets¦87976 wrote,
\q1 ‘It wasn't me that you Israelis sacrificed¦87980 to for those forty years¦87983 in the wilderness¦87987.
\q1
\v 43 You turned to Molech's tent and Rephan's star¦88002 as your¦88005 gods by making images¦88009 of them to bow down to. So for that, I'll send you all away into exile beyond¦88021 Babylon¦88022.’
\p
\v 44 \x + \xo 7:44: \xt Exo 25:9,40.\x*The tent of evidence was with our¦88032 ancestors¦88030 in the wilderness¦88035—made to the pattern¦88049 that God had shown Moses.
\v 45 \x + \xo 7:45: \xt Josh 3:14-17.\x*Our¦88059 ancestors¦88058 then carried that tent into the land, having¦88056 inherited¦88056 it along with Joshua from the possession¦88065 of the pagans which¦88053 \nd God¦88072\nd* drove¦88069 out ahead of them. The tent remained there until¦88079 the time of David¦88082
\v 46 \x + \xo 7:46: \xt 2Sam 7:1-16; 1Ch 17:1-14.\x*who found¦88084 favour¦88085 with \nd God¦88088\nd* and¦88089 requested¦88090 to find a tent for the house¦88095 of Yacob¦88097,
\v 47 \x + \xo 7:47: \xt 1Ki 6:1-38; 2Ch 3:1-17.\x*but it was Solomon¦88098 who built¦88102 the house¦88105 for God \add to reside in\add*.
\p
\v 48 However the highest¦88110 one doesn't actually live in structures made by people, but as the prophet¦88120 wrote,
\q1
\v 49 \x + \xo 7:49-50: \xt Isa 66:1-2.\x*‘Heaven is my throne¦88127,

\q1 How could you¦88138 possibly build¦88138 a suitable house¦88137 for me?
\q1
\v 50 Wasn't it me that created everything?’
\p
\v 51 \x + \xo 7:51: \xt Isa 63:10.\x*You stiff-necked people with uncircumcised¦88160 hearts¦88165 and ears¦88169! You're always¦88171 opposing¦88176 the holy \nd spirit¦88173\nd* just like your¦88181 ancestors¦88180 were.
\v 52 Which¦88185 one of the prophets¦88187 wasn't persecuted¦88189 by your¦88193 ancestors¦88192? Even the ones that foretold¦88198 the coming of the righteous¦88204 one were killed¦88195 off by them in just the same way that you yourselves became¦88212 his betrayers¦88208 and murderers¦88210!

\p
\v 54 When they heard that, they were raging inside and grating¦88234 their¦88236 teeth¦88237 at him¦88239.
\v 55 But being¦88240 full of the holy \nd spirit¦88245\nd*, Stephen stared up into the sky and¦88254 was able to see God's splendor, as well as seing \nd Yeshua¦88255\nd* standing there on God's right¦88260.
\v 56 He said¦88266, “I can look through the sky that's opened¦88271 up and can see humanity's child standing at God's right¦88280 side.”
\p
\v 57 At this point, they blocked their¦88291 ears¦88290 and rushed¦88293 together to grab Stephen, yelling loudly¦88287.
\v 58 They drove him out of the city¦88302 and then started throwing¦88298 rocks at him. His accusers left their¦88312 cloaks in charge of a young¦88317 man¦88317 named¦88319 Saul.
\v 59 As Stephen was being hit by the rocks, he called out, “\nd Master¦88329 Yeshua¦88331\nd*, receive¦88333 my¦88336 spirit¦88335.”
\v 60 Then falling to his knees¦88340, just before he died he called out loudly¦88344, “\nd Master¦88347\nd*, don't¦88348 hold this sin¦88355 against them.”

\v 5 Around the same time, Philip went to a city¦88453 in Samaria¦88456 and told them about the \nd messiah¦88460\nd*.
\v 6 Crowds gathered and listened carefully to Philip and watched him do miracles—
\v 7 many demon-possessed¦88497 people shouted¦88498 loudly¦88501 as the demons¦88497 left them, and many who were paralysed¦88506 or lame were healed¦88509

\s1 Simon the magician seeks power
\rem /s1 Simon the Sorcerer
\p
\v 9 One man¦88523 in the city¦88532 had been practicing¦88533 magic¦88533 and amazing¦88535 the people¦88539, and he claimed that he was someone¦88544 great¦88546. His name¦88526 was Simon¦88527
\v 10 and the people there from the least to the most important said, “This power is from the great \nd god¦88561\nd*.”
\v 11 They gave him¦88567 a lot of attention because¦88568 he'd been amazing them with magic¦88573 for quite a long time¦88571.
\v 12 However when Philip started preaching¦88583 the good message about God's kingdom¦88588 and the name and authority of \nd Yeshua¦88596\nd* the \nd messiah¦88597\nd*, they believed¦88578 the message, and many men and women¦88602 asked to be immersed¦88598 \add in water\add*.
\v 13 Simon¦88605 himself¦88607 also believed¦88608 and was immersed¦88610, and then started accompanying Philip around—marvelling¦88627 as he observed¦88616 the miracles¦88622 and signs¦88620 of God's power.
\p
\v 14 When the missionaries in Yerusalem¦88633 heard¦88629 that many people from Samaria¦88639 had accepted God's message¦88641, they¦88645 sent¦88645 Peter and¦88650 Yohan¦88651 out to them
\v 15 so then they prayed¦88654 for them to receive¦88658 the holy \nd spirit¦88659\nd*.
\v 16 (The holy spirit hadn't fallen¦88669 on any of them at that point, but¦88671 they¦88673 had only been immersed¦88672 into the name¦88676 and authority of the \nd master¦88679 Yeshua¦88680\nd*.)
\v 17 So Peter and Yohan placed their¦88686 hands¦88687 on the new believers and they received¦88691 the holy \nd spirit¦88692\nd*.
\p
\v 18 When Simon¦88698 the magician saw that they received the \nd spirit¦88709\nd* after having¦88694 the hands¦88704 of the missionaries placed on them, he offered¦88712 money¦88715 to Peter and Yohan, saying,
\v 19 “Give me this authority¦88722 so that anyone who I place \em my\em* hands¦88731 on will receive¦88732 the holy \nd spirit¦88733\nd*.”
\p
\v 20 But Peter responded, “May your money¦88758 join you in your destruction¦88749 because¦88750 you thought¦88755 you could buy God's gift¦88752 with it¦88747.
\v 21 There's¦88762 no role for you here and no part for you in our work because your¦88774 heart¦88773 isn't right¦88777 with \nd God¦88782\nd*.
\v 22 You need to turn away from this evil¦88787 \add desire\add* and beg the \nd master¦88794\nd* that maybe he'll forgive¦88798 you for your¦88789 wrong intentions¦88802
\v 23 because I perceive that you¦88818 have a bitter¦88810 attitude and¦88812 ungodly habits.
\p
\v 24 Simon¦88823 answered¦88820, “Oh, please ask the \nd master¦88837\nd* on my behalf that none of what you¦88851 mentioned will happen to me.”

\v 25 After that, Peter and Yohan continued to testify¦88861 and proclaim the good message¦88866 about the \nd master¦88869\nd* in many villages¦88878 around Samaria¦88880 before they returned¦88871 to Yerusalem¦88874.

\p
\v 26 Then a messenger¦88883 from the \nd master¦88885\nd* spoke¦88886 to Philip, “Start walking and head south¦88896 on the road that goes downhill from Yerusalem¦88904 to Gaza through the wilderness¦88909.”
\v 27 So he headed off, and \add on the road\add* he came across an important official¦88918 of the Ethiopian queen\f + \fr 8:27 \ft Some translations list the queen's name as ‘Candace’, but that was the name of the series of queens, cf., Pharaoh or Caesar which came to be used as a title for more than one person.\f* who was in charge of her¦88930 treasury¦88929.

\v 28 and was returning¦88941 home in his¦88947 chariot¦88946. As he rode, he was reading¦88949 \add the scroll of\add* the prophet¦88955 Isayah,
\v 29 and the \nd spirit¦88960\nd* told Philip to approach him and stay by the chariot¦88967.
\v 30 So Philip ran up to the chariot and heard¦88974 the man reading from the prophet¦88979 Isayah and asked, “Do you know what it is that you're¦88987 reading about?”
\p
\v 31 “How could I know when I don't¦88999 have someone¦89000 to guide me,” he answered, and so he invited Philip to climb up and sit¦89010 with him.

\v 33 He was humiliated¦89047 by a lack of justice¦89050.

\p
\v 34 “Now tell me,” said¦89073 the official, “who was Isayah talking about? Was he talking about himself¦89083 or someone¦89087 else?”
\v 35 So Philip started with that passage and explained the good¦89102 message¦89102 about \nd Yeshua¦89105\nd* to him.
\v 36 As they were going¦89108 along¦89109 the road¦89111, they came to some water, and the official asked, “Look, here's some water. What would stop me from being immersed¦89125 here?”
\p
\v 37 ≈
\v 38 So he commanded¦89150 \add the driver\add* to stop the chariot¦89153 and they both climbed down, and Philip immersed¦89167 the official in the water¦89159.
\v 39 But as they came out of the water¦89174, the \nd master's¦89183 spirit¦89175\nd* snatched¦89184 Philip away and so the official never saw¦89189 him again, but he continued on his¦89199 journey very happy.
\v 40 As for Philip, he found¦89203 himself at \add the town of\add* Azotus, and as he passed through¦89207 \add the coastal towns\add* on the way to Caesarea¦89218, he proclaimed the good¦89208 message¦89208 in each town.

\v 1 Meanwhile Saul was still¦89223 spouting off murderous¦89227 threats¦89225 towards¦89228 the followers of the \nd master¦89232\nd*. He went to the chief¦89235 priest¦89235
\v 2 and obtained \add official\add* letters¦89240 to enable him to enter the Jewish¦89246 meeting¦89246 halls¦89246 in Damascus¦89242 so that if he found either male or female followers of Yeshua, he could arrest them and bring¦89261 them to Yerusalem¦89263 in chains.
\p
\v 3 On his journey as he approached Damascus¦89272, suddenly¦89274 light¦89279 from the sky¦89284 flashed¦89278 around¦89278 him.
\v 4 He dropped to his knees\f + \fr 9:4 \ft It seems most likely that Paul and company were walking to Damascus (and not on horseback despite paintings by Caravaggio and others). The journey of somewhere around 300km would have taken around two weeks.\f* and heard¦89290 a voice¦89291 calling, “Saul, Saul, why are you¦89298 persecuting¦89298 me?”
\p
\v 5 “Who are you, master¦89304?” he¦89299 asked.
\p And the voice replied, “I'm \nd Yeshua¦89311\nd*, the one that you're¦89315 persecuting¦89316.
\v 6 Now, stand up and go into the city¦89344, and you'll be told there what you need to do.”
\p
\v 7 Meanwhile his travelling¦89357 companions had stood¦89359 there speechless¦89360, because they had heard the voice¦89364 but couldn't see anyone.
\v 8 They helped Saul¦89372 up from the ground¦89375, but even when he opened¦89376 his¦89383 eyes¦89382, he couldn't see anything. So they had to lead him into Damascus¦89392 by hand¦89387.
\v 9 Saul stayed there for three¦89396 days¦89395, unable to see and¦89399 not eating or drinking anything.
\s1 Ananias restores Saul's sight
\p
\v 10 Now there was a believer there in Damascus¦89411 named Ananias, and the master spoke to him in a vision¦89421, calling, “Ananias.”
\p “I'm here, master,” he answered.
\p
\v 11 So the \nd master¦89433\nd* told him¦89435, “Get up and¦89445 go to Yudas' house¦89448 in Straight¦89444 Street where you'll find a man named Saul from Tarsus¦89452. He's praying¦89455 right now
\v 12 and in his vision¦89460, he saw¦89457 a man¦89458 named Ananias¦89463 who comes in and places his hands¦89471 on him so that he can receive¦89473 his sight¦89473 back.”
\p
\v 13 But Ananias¦89477 resisted, “\nd Master¦89478\nd*, I've heard¦89480 a lot about that man¦89485, including all the evil¦89488 things he's done to your¦89492 dedicated people in Yerusalem¦89495,
\v 14 and¦89497 the reason he's here in Damascus with the authority¦89500 of the chief¦89503 priests¦89503 is to arrest everyone who trusts in you¦89510.”
\p
\v 15 But the \nd master¦89516\nd* said¦89511, “Go now, because¦89518 I have chosen that man¦89524 to be a bearer of my¦89529 name¦89528 and authority both in other countries, even to their kings¦89535, and to the descendants of Israel,
\v 16 because I'll be showing¦89541 him what he's going to have to suffer¦89550 for bearing my¦89549 name¦89548.”
\p
\v 17 So Ananias¦89554 left and went¦89551 into Yudas' house¦89559 where he placed his hands¦89565 on Saul and said¦89568, “Brother Saul, the \nd master¦89572\nd* has sent¦89573 me here—\nd Yeshua¦89575\nd* the one you saw on the road¦89581 when you were coming¦89583 here—so that you will be able to see again and also be filled¦89588 with the holy \nd spirit¦89589\nd*.”
\v 18 Immediately something¦89593 like scales¦89602 fell off Saul's eyes¦89598 and he was able to see again, and he got up¦89609 and got immersed¦89611 in water,
\v 19 before getting something to eat to renew his strength¦89616.

\p Then Saul stayed several days¦89626 with the believers in Damascus.
\v 20 He went straight into the Jewish¦89633 meeting¦89633 halls¦89633 and started proclaiming¦89634 that \nd Yeshua¦89636\nd* is God's son.
\p
\v 21 The hearers were all amazed¦89645, saying¦89653, “Isn't this the guy that persecuted¦89658 the ones following that Yeshua in Yerusalem¦89661, and even came to Damascus to arrest them here and take them back to the chief¦89681 priests¦89681?”
\p
\v 22 But Saul was growing stronger\f + \fr 9:22 \ft It's not clear here whether it means that Saul was growing physically stronger, or that his preaching and debating skills were improving.\f* and he was confounding¦89689 the Jews¦89691 living¦89693 in Damascus¦89695 as he taught¦89696 them that Yeshua is the \add promised\add* \nd messiah¦89701\nd*.

\rem /s1 Saul in Jerusalem
\p
\v 26 When he got back to Yerusalem¦89761, Saul attempted¦89763 to join in with the believers there but they were all scared of him, not believing¦89773 that he was a true follower of Yeshua.
\v 27 However Barnabas¦89777 took Saul and brought¦89781 him to the twelve, and Saul told them how he had seen the \nd master¦89794\nd* on the road¦89791, and been spoken to by him, and how he had spoken boldly¦89803 in Damascus¦89802 in the name¦89806 and authority of \nd Yeshua¦89808\nd*.
\v 28 So Saul stayed connected with the believers, going¦89816 in and out of Yerusalem¦89819 and speaking¦89822 boldly¦89822 in the name¦89825 and authority of the \nd master¦89827\nd*.
\v 29 He also talked and¦89831 debated¦89832 with the Greek-speaking Jews, but¦89839 they¦89838 wanted to kill¦89842 him¦89843,
\v 30 so when the brothers¦89848 found out, they took Saul down to Caesarea¦89853 \add on the coast\add*, and from there sent¦89855 him \add on a ship\add* to Tarsus¦89859.

\v 32 Peter¦89897 travelled around the country and then went to visit the dedicated believers in Lydda¦89909.
\v 33 He saw a paralysed¦89928 man¦89914 named Aeneas who'd spent eight¦89921 years¦89920 lying¦89922 on his pallet¦89925,
\v 34 and said¦89930 to him¦89931, “Aeneas, \nd Yeshua¦89939\nd* the \nd messiah¦89941\nd* is healing¦89935 you¦89936. Stand up and pack up your bed.” And straight away Aeneas stood up
\v 35 and all the people living¦89956 in Lydda¦89957 and Sharon¦89961 who saw¦89950 him¦89953 became followers of the \nd master¦89968\nd*.

\rem /s1 Peter in Lydda and Joppa
\p
\v 36 Then in Yoppa¦89970 there was a believer named Tabitha¦89976 (or Dorcas if translated) and¦89987 she¦89990 did a lot of good¦89986 things as well as being generous to the poor.
\v 37 Around that time she¦89998 got sick and died. After washing her¦90002 body, they¦90003 placed it¦89991 in an upper¦90007 room,
\v 38 and since Yoppa¦90015 was near Lydda¦90011 and the believers had heard¦90018 that Peter was there, they¦90024 quickly sent¦90024 two¦90025 men¦90026 to request, “Please come as soon as possible.”
\v 39 So Peter went with them, and when they arrived¦90044 in Yoppa they took him up to the room. All the widows¦90056 stood¦90052 there, sobbing and showing¦90059 him various clothes¦90062 that Tabitha had made for them.
\v 40 But Peter had them all removed from the room, and then kneeling down he prayed¦90089 before turning back to the body¦90094 and said¦90095, “Tabitha¦90096, get up.” Then she opened¦90100 her¦90103 eyes¦90102, and seeing Peter there she sat¦90108 up.
\v 41 Peter helped her to stand up, then he called¦90117 the believers and the widows¦90123, and presented¦90127 the live Tabitha to them.
\v 42 News of this spread throughout¦90133 Yoppa¦90136 and¦90137 many people there believed¦90139 in the \nd master¦90143\nd*.
\v 43 So Peter stayed on there for quite a few days¦90147, living with a tanner¦90157 of hides named Simon¦90156.

\s1 Peter and Cornelius each hear from God
\rem /s1 Cornelius Calls for Peter
\rem /s1 Peter and Cornelius
\p
\v 1 Just up in Caesarea¦90163 there was a Roman army commander named Cornelius (leader of the ‘Italian¦90173 Regiment’)
\v 2 who, along with all his household¦90182, worshipped God and obeyed his laws. He gave to the poor and regularly asked God for help.
\v 3 One afternoon around 3pm he had a vision¦90198 where he clearly¦90199 saw¦90196 one of God's messengers¦90207 come¦90210 into the house and call, “Cornelius.”
\p
\v 4 Cornelius was scared and looked¦90219 intently¦90219 and asked, “What is it, master¦90227?”
\p “Your¦90233 prayers¦90232 and your¦90233 helping the poor rose up to God's notice and attention,” he said.
\v 5 “Now, send some messengers to Yoppa¦90250 to go and find a man there named Simon¦90254 Peter.
\v 6 He's staying with Simon¦90266 the tanner¦90268 whose¦90269 house¦90272 is by the sea¦90274.”
\v 7 So as soon as the messenger¦90286 left, Cornelius called¦90292 two¦90293 of his house¦90295 servants¦90295 and¦90297 a godly¦90299 soldier¦90298 from his bodyguard,
\v 8 and after explaining¦90304 the task to them, he sent¦90310 them off to Yoppa¦90314.
\rem /s1 Peter's Vision
\rem /s1 Peter Visits Cornelius
\p
\v 9 The next day¦90315 as they were approaching the town, Peter went¦90325 up onto the flat roof of the house¦90329 around midday to pray.
\v 10 But he felt hungry¦90338 and wanted something to eat, but while it was still being prepared¦90342 he fell into a trance¦90352
\v 11 and saw the sky open up. Something like a sheet¦90365 was being¦90373 lowered down to the earth¦90376 by the four¦90367 corners¦90368
\v 12 and it held all kinds of animals and reptiles¦90390, as well as birds¦90395.
\v 13 Then he heard a voice¦90400 saying, “Get up Peter, and slaughter these and eat¦90407 them.”
\p
\v 14 “I can't, \nd master¦90413\nd*,” Peter responded, “because¦90414 I've never¦90415 eaten anything that's forbidden.”
\p
\v 15 But the voice¦90423 spoke a second¦90428 time¦90428, “Don't you¦90435 be treating anything as unclean that \nd God¦90433\nd* has made clean¦90434.”
\v 16 This vision happened three¦90443 times and¦90444 then the sheet thing was lifted back up into the sky.
\p
\v 17 Now Peter was still there wondering what the vision¦90468 was all about when the men¦90474 sent¦90476 by Cornelius had tracked down the tanner's house¦90484 and arrived outside.
\v 18 They called out to ask if Simon¦90496 Peter was staying there.
\p
\v 19 Even as Peter still continued to ponder¦90506 about¦90507 the vision¦90509, the \nd spirit¦90514\nd* said¦90510, “Hey, there's three¦90519 men¦90517 here looking¦90520 for¦90520 you¦90522.
\v 20 So get up and¦90527 go downstairs to them. Believe everything they say because¦90535 I sent¦90538 them here.”
\v 21 So he went down and asked the men¦90548, “I'm the one you're looking¦90561 for, so tell me what you came here for.”
\p
\v 22 They answered, “We were sent by Cornelius who's an army commander who worships \nd God¦90585\nd* and obeys his laws and has a good reputation with you Jewish people. A holy messenger¦90597 told him¦90604 to send¦90599 for you to come to his house¦90603 so they can listen to what you have to say.”
\v 23 So Peter invited them in to stay the night.
\rem /s1 Peter at Cornelius' House
\p The next day¦90619, Peter and¦90628 some of the believers¦90631 from Yoppa¦90635 started out with them
\v 24 and they arrived in Caesarea¦90649 the following day¦90641. Cornelius was expecting¦90655 them and had also invited some relatives¦90660 and close¦90665 friends¦90666 to join them.
\v 25 Peter entered the house and when they met, Cornelius knelt down and worshipped him
\v 26 but Peter pulled him¦90710 up and said, “Stand up. I'm just a man like you.”
\v 27 After greeting each other, Peter went into the main room and¦90732 found that quite a few people had gathered there.
\v 28 Then he told them, “You all know that us Jews¦90749 are forbidden by our laws to associate with or to enter the house of a non-Jew. However, \nd God¦90762\nd* showed¦90764 me that it's not right to treat other¦90755 people as being¦90751 lesser or undesirable.
\v 29 That's why I came¦90774 without any reservations when you sent for me. But I'm still waiting to know what you all want from me?”
\p
\v 30 So Cornelius answered, “I was praying¦90809 in my¦90813 house¦90812 three days ago in the middle of the afternoon when I suddenly saw a man¦90816 in shining¦90823 clothes¦90822 standing in front of me
\v 31 and he said, ‘Your¦90829 prayer¦90832 has been heard, Cornelius¦90826, and \nd God¦90843\nd* has noticed your¦90829 gifts to the poor.
\v 32 Now he wants you to send¦90844 messengers to get Simon, the one called¦90852 Peter, from Yoppa¦90847 where he's living by the sea¦90866 in Simon the tanner's¦90862 house¦90858.’
\v 33 I did that straight away and you kindly came here, so now we're all here in God's \add sight\add* to find out everything that the \nd master¦90912\nd* has commanded¦90906 you to say.”

\rem /s1 Gentiles Hear the Good Message; The Gentiles Hear the Good News; Peter's Speech

\v 34 So Peter spoke up and said¦90921, “Honestly, I'm still just realising that \nd God¦90931\nd* doesn't favour¦90929 only certain people\x + \xo 10:34: \xt Deu 10:17.\x*,
\v 35 but he accepts¦90942 people from any nation¦90935 as long as they honour and obey him.
\v 36 He sent us a message through the descendants of Israel—a good message that teaches that we can have peace¦90956 through \nd Yeshua¦90958\nd* the \nd messiah¦90959\nd*—everyone's \nd master¦90963\nd*.
\v 37 And you all know the news that started in Galilee¦90979 and spread through¦90970 all Yudea after¦90980 the time of Yohan's teaching and ministry of immersion¦90982—
\v 38 how God filled \nd Yeshua¦90986\nd* from Nazareth¦90989 with the holy \nd spirit¦90996\nd* and with power¦91000, and who then went around doing¦91006 good¦91006 and healing¦91008 all those oppressed¦91011 by the devil¦91015, because¦91016 God was with him.
\v 39 We are witnesses¦91027 of all the things¦91029 he did in the Jewish provinces and in Yerusalem¦91040, and then how he was executed by them on a stake¦91047.
\v 40 Then \nd God¦91050\nd* brought him back to life on the third¦91056 day¦91058 and sent him where he could be seen,

\v 42 He commanded¦91097 us to tell the people¦91101, and to testify¦91103 that he is the one who \nd God¦91112\nd* has designated¦91109 to be the judge¦91113 of the living¦91114 and the dead¦91116.

\v 44 While Peter was still¦91134 speaking¦91135, the holy \nd spirit¦91144\nd* came down onto everyone who was listening.
\v 45 The Jewish believers¦91158 who had come with Peter were astonished that the gift¦91171 of the holy \nd spirit¦91174\nd* had been poured¦91177 out even on non-Jews¦91169
\v 46 as they¦91178 heard them speaking¦91181 in other languages¦91182 and¦91183 magnifying¦91184 \nd God¦91186\nd*. Then Peter said,

\v 1 Soon the missionaries and¦91250 other believers¦91253 in Yudea heard¦91243 that non-Jews¦91266 had also accepted God's message¦91270,
\v 2 but when Peter went¦91279 to Yerusalem¦91287, the strict Jewish believers were upset with him¦91322,
\v 3 saying¦91326 that he had gone into the home of uncircumcised¦91332 pagans and¦91335 \add even\add* eaten with them.
\p
\v 4 But Peter started explaining¦91344 from the beginning,
\v 5 “I was staying in Yoppa¦91353, and as I was praying¦91355 I saw¦91357 a vision¦91360 of an object¦91363 like a sheet¦91366 coming¦91361 down, as if it was being¦91371 let down out of the sky by its four¦91368 corners¦91370. As it came¦91377 down to me
\v 6 I looked¦91383 at it and saw¦91386 animals, even wild animals, and reptiles¦91396 and birds¦91399.
\v 7 I also heard¦91403 a voice¦91406 telling me, ‘Peter, get up and slaughter these and eat¦91416 them.’
\v 8 But I said¦91417, ‘\nd Master¦91421\nd*, I can't because¦91422 I've never¦91428 eaten anything that's forbidden.’
\v 9 But the voice¦91438 from the sky spoke again, ‘Don't you¦91451 be treating anything as unclean that \nd God¦91449\nd* has made clean¦91450.’
\v 10 This happened three¦91458 times, and¦91459 then it was pulled¦91461 up again¦91462 into the sky.

\v 15 Then when I started speaking¦91562 to them, the holy \nd spirit¦91567\nd* came down on them just like \nd it\nd* had happened to us previously.
\v 16 That reminded¦91580 me of the words of the \nd master¦91586\nd* when he told us, ‘Yohan¦91589 immersed people in water¦91592, but you all will be immersed in the holy \nd spirit¦91597\nd*.
\v 17 Therefore¦91601 if God gave¦91605 the same¦91603 gift¦91604 to them that he'd given to us when we'd believed¦91613 in the \nd master¦91616 Yeshua¦91617\nd* the \nd messiah¦91618\nd*, what authority did I have to contradict God?’ ”
\p
\v 18 When the group heard¦91636 all this, they had no objections and they praised God, saying¦91646, “It seems that God has also allowed the pagans¦91651 to repent¦91655 and live.”

\p
\v 19 Over time, due to the persecution that began with Stephen's killing, the ones who had moved away went as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch¦91680, but they only shared Yeshua's teaching with other Jews¦91690.
\v 20 However, some of the believers were from Cyprus and Cyrene, and when they got to Antioch¦91705 they proclaimed the good¦91713 news from the \nd master¦91715 Yeshua¦91716\nd* to the Greeks.
\v 21 And the master caused their efforts to prosper, so a large number¦91727 of Greeks believed¦91729 and decided to follow the master.
\p
\v 22 News about this reached the assembly¦91742 in Yerusalem¦91746, so they¦91751 sent¦91751 Barnabas¦91752 to Antioch¦91756.
\v 23 When he arrived¦91759 and saw how God's grace¦91763 \add was spreading\add*, he was elated¦91767 and encouraged them all to earnestly continue to follow the \nd master¦91778\nd*.
\v 24 Barnabas was good¦91783 man¦91781 and full of the holy \nd spirit¦91786\nd* and full of faith¦91789 \add in God\add*, and a large¦91793 number of people decided to follow Yeshua.
\p
\v 25 So Barnabas went to Tarsus¦91803 to look for Saul,
\v 26 and when he found¦91815 him, he brought¦91818 him back to Antioch. Then for a whole¦91832 year¦91831 they met with the assembly¦91837 and \add regularly\add* taught a large¦91842 crowd¦91841. It was there in Antioch that the believers were first¦91847 called Christians.
\p
\v 27 In those days¦91867, some prophets¦91871 from Yerusalem¦91870 went to Antioch¦91873,
\v 28 and one of them named Agabus when he was prompted by the \nd spirit¦91894\nd*, stood¦91882 up and predicted that the world¦91904 would experience a severe famine¦91895 (and this happened \add later\add* during¦91909 the reign of Claudius).
\v 29 The believers decided to send¦91928 assistance to their¦91925 fellow¦91934 believers who lived in Yudea—each one according to his means—
\v 30 and so they¦91939 did, sending their contributions with Barnabus¦91946 and Saul¦91948 to take to the elders¦91943.

\v 1 Around that time¦91954, King Herod¦91958 \add Agrippa\add* used his power to mistreat¦91964 some of the believers from the assembly¦91969,
\v 2 and he had Yacob¦91976, the brother¦91978 of Yohan¦91979, executed by the sword¦91981.
\v 3 Then when he saw that it pleased¦91986 the Jewish religious leaders, he went on to seize Peter during the Feast of Flat Bread.
\v 4 After being arrested¦92009, Peter was put in prison¦92013 where he was guarded¦92020 by four squads¦92018 of four soldiers¦92019 each. After the Passover Feast, Herod planned to display Peter to the people¦92030,
\v 5 but while he was being¦92035 held in prison¦92038, those in the assembly¦92054 were earnestly¦92046 asking \nd God¦92034\nd* to help him.

\p
\v 6 Herod¦92072 planned to send for Peter later that evening, but meanwhile Peter had fallen¦92079 asleep¦92079 chained with two chains between¦92080 two soldiers¦92082. There were also prison¦92097 guards¦92086 at the door¦92093
\v 7 but one of the \nd master's¦92101\nd* messengers \add suddenly appeared\add* standing by Peter and light¦92106 radiated through the prison¦92111 cell. The messenger poked Peter in the side to wake him up, saying¦92121, “Quickly, get up!” The chains¦92130 fell off his¦92128 wrists
\v 8 and the messenger said, “Get dressed and put on your sandals¦92148,” so he did. Then the messenger said, “Now put on your coat¦92158 and follow¦92161 me.”
\v 9 So Peter followed¦92165 the messenger¦92178 out of the cell, not really knowing¦92169 if it was real or if he was still dreaming.
\v 10 They went past the first¦92186 guard¦92187 and then the second¦92189, and then came to the iron gate which led out of the prison into the city¦92202. The gate opened¦92205 by itself and they went out onto the street, then at the end of the street the messenger¦92224 suddenly left him.
\p
\v 11 By now Peter was fully awake and said¦92235 to himself¦92233, “Now I know that the \nd master¦92243\nd* really did send his¦92246 messenger¦92245 to rescue¦92248 me from Herod¦92253 and from the plans of the Jewish leaders.”
\p
\v 12 Now that he realised this, he went to Maria's¦92271 house¦92269 (the mother¦92273 of Yohan¦92274 Mark) where¦92279 many believers had met to pray.
\v 13 He knocked¦92285 at the door¦92292 in the fence and a servant¦92297 girl¦92297 named Rhoda came out to see who it was.
\v 14 But when she recognised¦92304 Peter's voice¦92306, she was so excited that she forgot about opening the door, but ran back inside to tell everyone that Peter was standing out there.
\v 15 They told her that she must be raving¦92336 mad, but she insisted¦92339 it was true, but they said¦92334 that it must be his¦92353 messenger¦92350.
\p
\v 16 Meanwhile Peter continued¦92357 knocking¦92358, and when they eventually opened¦92360 the outer door, they saw¦92363 that it¦92360 was him¦92366 and they were amazed.
\v 17 But Peter signalled them with his hand¦92375 to be quiet, and then he explained how the \nd master¦92387\nd* had led him out of the prison¦92392, and instructed them, “Tell this to Yacob¦92397 and the brothers¦92400.” Then he left and went off to another¦92406 place¦92407.
\p
\v 18 Once daylight came, there¦92411 was pandemonium among¦92415 the soldiers¦92417 \add in the prison as they tried to figure out\add* what had happened to Peter.
\v 19 Then when King Herod sent for Peter and he wasn't there, the prison guards¦92433 were interrogated and then taken away to be executed.

\p
\v 20 Now King Herod was disputing with the people of Tyre¦92453 and Tsidon, and so they got together and persuaded¦92471 Blastos¦92472, a close personal servant of the king, to be their¦92486 spokesman in asking for peace¦92482 because¦92483 they were dependent on food from the king's provinces.
\p
\v 21 On the agreed day¦92498, Herod¦92500 dressed¦92501 in his royal¦92503 garments and seated on his throne, started to address¦92509 them.
\v 22 The crowd shouted out, “This is the voice¦92522 of a \nd god¦92521\nd*, not of a man.”
\v 23 Because he didn't attribute the honour to \nd God¦92543\nd*, one the \nd master's¦92535\nd* messengers¦92534 immediately¦92529 struck¦92532 him down and he stopped¦92555 breathing¦92555 as a result of a worm infestation.
\p
\v 24 Meanwhile God's message¦92558 continued to spread and¦92564 multiply¦92565.

\v 2 One day when they were ministering¦92623 to the \nd master¦92627\nd* and fasting¦92629, the holy \nd spirit¦92632\nd* said¦92630, Appoint Barnabas¦92640 and Saul¦92643 to serve me and do the work that I have called¦92648 them to.”

\s1 Sergius believes after Bar-Jesus is blinded
\p
\v 6 They travelled around the island¦92722 and when they got to Paphos, they met a Jewish man¦92728 named Bar-Jesus.\f + \fr 13:6 \ft The Greek form of his name was Elymas according to verse 8.\f* He was a sorcerer and false¦92732 prophet¦92732

\v 8 but the sorcerer opposed them and tried to prevent Sergius¦92769 from believing.
\v 9 So then Saul¦92789 (the \add Roman\add* form of his name was Paul¦92793), filled¦92794 with the holy \nd spirit¦92795\nd* looked¦92798 intently¦92798 at Bar-Jesus
\v 10 and said¦92801, “You're full of all kinds of deceit¦92805 and fraud¦92809 you child of the devil¦92812. Will you never stop twisting the truth about following the \nd master¦92822\nd*?

\p And immediately¦92845 he could only see fog and darkness¦92857, and needed someone to guide him around¦92859 by the hand.

\v 13 After that, Paul\f + \fr 13:13 \ft From this point on in the text, Paul is referred to by his Roman name as his ministry is largely outside of Israel. (In Israel he seemed to be better known as Saul, the Greek form of his Hebrew name Sha-ul.)\f* and his companions sailed from Paphos to Perga¦92894 in Pamphylia, but Yohan¦92897 Mark left them and returned¦92902 to Yerusalem¦92905.
\v 14 Paul and his companions, went on from Perga¦92912 to Pisidian¦92920 Antioch¦92916, where they entered the Jewish¦92926 meeting¦92926 hall¦92926 on the Rest Day and sat¦92935 down \add with the congregation\add*.
\v 15 After the readings¦92939 from the Law and from the Prophets,\f + \fr 13:15 \ft The Hebrew Scriptures are divided into the Law, the Prophets, and the Writings.\f* the leaders¦92947 sent¦92945 a messenger over to them to ask, “Men, brothers¦92952, if you¦92960 bring any message¦92961 of encouragement for the congregation, please share it¦92966.”
\p
\v 16 So Paul¦92970 stood¦92967 up and, motioning with his hand¦92974, started speaking, “Fellow Israelis and every who reveres¦92981 \nd God¦92983\nd*, listen to me.
\v 17 The \nd God¦92986\nd* of the people of Israel chose¦92992 our¦92995 ancestors¦92994 and helped the people to prosper when they were staying in Egypt¦93008. Then later he showed his power as he led them out
\v 18 and¦93017 sustainedXXX them in the wilderness¦93028 for around forty years.
\v 19 Then having¦93030 overthrown seven¦93032 nations¦93031 in Caanan\x + \xo 13:19: a \xt Deu 7:1; \xo b \xt Josh 14:1.\x*, he passed¦93036 on that land as an inheritance
\v 20 after¦93054 around 450 years¦93049.
\p “Then he gave¦93056 them judges¦93057 through until¦93058 the time of the prophet¦93061 Samuel
\v 21 when they¦93063 requested¦93063 a king¦93064, and¦93065 \nd God¦93069\nd* gave¦93066 them Saul, the son of Kish from the tribe¦93076 of Benjamin to reign for forty¦93079 years¦93078.
\v 22 After Saul was removed¦93081, God chose David to be their king¦93089—the man of whom he said, ‘I found¦93094 David the son of Jesse¦93099, a man who wants to obey me and do everything I ask.’
\v 23 Then eventually a descendant of David arrived in Israel as promised¦93120—the saviour¦93126 \nd Yeshua¦93128\nd*.
\v 24 Before he arrived Yohan-the-Immerser had publicly¦93129 preached to all the people¦93140 of Israel about being immersed¦93136 \add as a sign\add* of repentance¦93137.
\v 25 As Yohan's ministry was nearing an end, he asked, ‘Who do you suspect¦93155 I am? I'm not the messiah, but he will come after¦93163 me, and I'm not \add even\add* worthy¦93169 to undo his sandals¦93172.’
\p
\v 26 “Men, brothers¦93177, descendants¦93179 of Abraham¦93180 and¦93181 others here who revere¦93186 \nd God¦93188\nd*, the teaching about this salvation¦93195 has been sent¦93197 to us.
\v 27 The people of Yerusalem¦93203 and their \add religious\add* leaders didn't recognise this \add Yeshua\add*, but by their judgement¦93225 of him¦93225 they¦93226 fulfilled¦93226 the words of the prophets¦93217 that are read every¦93220 Rest Day.
\v 28 Despite not finding even one charge against him worthy of death¦93230, they requested¦93237 Pilate¦93240 to execute him
\v 29 and when they had done all the things¦93253 that \add the prophets\add* had written¦93257 about him, they took his body down from the stake¦93272 and placed it in a burial chamber.
\v 30 But \nd God¦93280\nd* brought him¦93282 back to life
\v 31 and his¦93309 followers who had come¦93292 to Yerusalem¦93299 from Galilee¦93297 saw him for several days¦93289 and now testify about this to the people¦93312.
\v 32 So now we're preaching¦93316 this good¦93316 message¦93316 to you¦93315 that what God promised¦93322 to our ancestors¦93320
\v 33 has now been fulfilled¦93329 for our¦93334 descendants, now that \nd God¦93328\nd* brought \nd Yeshua¦93340\nd* back to life just like it's written¦93354 in the second¦93356 psalm¦93352:
\q1 ‘You are my¦93359 son;
\q1 today¦93363 I have borne you.’
\m
\v 34 God brought him¦93388 back to life, and he's never going¦93392 to return¦93393 \add to the grave\add* to decay¦93395. As God said¦93397,
\q1 ‘I will give David's faithful¦93405 devout¦93402 \add things???\add* to you¦93400 all.’
\m
\v 35 So in another¦93410 psalm¦93410 God said,
\q1 ‘You won't allow your¦93417 devout¦93416 one to experience decay¦93419.’
\m
\v 36 This can't be David¦93420, because after he'd served his own generation¦93424 as \nd God¦93428\nd* led him, he indeed died and was buried with his ancestors¦93435 and his body decayed¦93439.
\v 37 On the contrary, the one who \nd God¦93444\nd* raised¦93445 from the dead never experienced decay¦93448.
\v 38 So brothers¦93455, let it¦93451 be known¦93449 to you all that your sins¦93463 can now be forgiven¦93461 through¦93457 this \add Yeshua\add*—the law of Moses was never able to offer you that.
\v 39 Everyone who puts their trust in \add Yeshua\add* is able to receive a clean record.
\v 40 But keep your eyes open in case something else the prophets¦93499 wrote might come¦93492 true:
\q1
\v 41 ‘Watch¦93500 you scoffers¦93502, and be amazed and die because¦93510 I'm doing¦93514 something special during your¦93519 time.
\q1 Even if someone¦93527 described¦93528 it clearly to you all, you still might not believe¦93525 it.’ ”
\p
\v 42 As they¦93541 left the meeting hall after¦93548 the service, the people invited them to speak again the following Rest Day.
\v 43 But when they starting walking away, many people followed¦93562 after¦93571 Paul¦93571 and Barnabas¦93574, who then addressed¦93576 them and encouraged them to continue trusting in God's grace¦93585.
\rem /s1 Paul Turns to the Gentiles
\p
\v 44 So on the following Rest Day, nearly everyone in the city¦93609 had gathered¦93610 there to hear¦93611 the message¦93617 from \nd God¦93622\nd*.
\v 45 But the Jewish religious leaders became very jealous¦93633 when they saw the crowds¦93630 and claimed that Paul's words had slandered¦93645 God.
\v 46 But Paul¦93651 and Barnabas¦93654 responded boldly¦93646, “It was necessary¦93661 for God's message¦93666 to be explained in the meeting hall to all of \add the Jews\add* first¦93662. But since you are rejecting that teaching, you are all judging¦93677 yourselves¦93680 to be unworthy of living forever, so instead, we will \add now\add* share it with the non-Jews¦93690.
\v 47 Because¦93692 this is what the \nd master¦93697\nd* commanded¦93693 us:
\q1 ‘I have chosen you to be a light¦93703 for the pagans¦93705;
\q2 You will take salvation¦93711 to the end of the earth¦93715.’
\p
\v 48 When the non-Jews¦93720 heard that, they¦93721 were very happy and were praising the \nd master's¦93730\nd* message¦93727, and as many as were appointed¦93735 to \add receive\add* eternal¦93738 life¦93737 believed¦93732 \add it¦93717\add*.
\p
\v 49 So from there, the \nd master's¦93746\nd* message¦93744 spread throughout the entire¦93749 region¦93751.
\v 50 But the Jewish religious leaders¦93766 incited¦93755 some prominent¦93762 women¦93759 from the meeting halls and some from the local city¦93768 government, and they then stirred¦93770 up persecution¦93774 against¦93775 Paul¦93777 and Barnabas¦93780 and had them expelled out of their¦93787 region¦93786.
\v 51 So Paul and Barnabas just left that place to face their own consequences, and continued on to Iconium.
\v 52 Meanwhile the believers \add back in Pisidian Antioch\add* were full of happiness and¦93809 of the holy \nd spirit¦93810\nd*.

\rem /s1 In Iconium
\p
\v 1 A similar thing happened in Iconium. Paul and Barnabas went into the Jewish¦93824 meeting¦93824 hall¦93824 and spoke in such as way that a lot of both Jews¦93826 and Greeks believed¦93833.
\v 2 But those Jews who didn't believe got the non-Jews¦93866 emotionally stirred¦93855 up to oppose the believers¦93869.
\v 3 So Paul and Barnabas ended up staying there for quite a while, and as they spoke boldly¦93883 for the \nd master¦93886\nd*, he himself confirmed his¦93894 grace¦93893 by enabling the two of them to be able to do miracles and amazing things.
\v 4 Nevertheless, the people¦93912 of the city¦93914 were divided¦93907—some agreeing with the \add strict\add* Jews¦93921, and others supporting the missionaries.
\p
\v 5 At one point, both the non-Jews¦93939 and the strict Jews and their¦93947 leaders got worked up enough to come in order to attack them and throw¦93950 rocks to kill them.
\v 6 However, Paul and Barnabas found out about it and escaped to the Lycaonian cities¦93957 of Lystra and Derbe and the surrounding¦93966 region¦93966
\v 7 and¦93968 preached¦93970 the good¦93970 message¦93970 there¦93968.

\v 8 In Lystra there was a man¦93990 sitting¦93998 there who had been unable to use his¦94004 legs since birth.
\v 9 He was listening to Paul speaking¦94017, when Paul looked¦94022 straight at him¦94024 and¦94027 realised that the man¦94010 had the faith¦94032 to be healed¦94034.
\v 10 So in a loud¦94036 voice¦94038, Paul said¦94035, “Stand¦94048 upright on your¦94052 feet¦94051.” And the man sprang¦94062 up and was walking¦94065 around.
\v 11 The crowd¦94069 of people who saw what Paul¦94075 had done began to shout out in Lycaonian, “These two look like men¦94086, but they're really gods¦94083 who have come down to us!”
\v 12 They called Barnabas¦94096 ‘Zeus’ and called Paul¦94101 ‘Hermas¦94102’ since¦94104 he was the main speaker.
\v 13 And the priest¦94116 of Zeus wanted to sacrifice¦94143 with the crowds¦94139, so he brought¦94135 bulls¦94128 and garlands¦94131 \add of flowers\add* to the city gates¦94134 from \add the temple\add* on the path to the city.
\p
\v 14 But when the missionaries Barnabas¦94149 and Paul¦94151 heard¦94144 what was going on, they tore their clothes \add in dismay\add* as they rushed¦94158 out into the crowd¦94163
\v 15 shouting, “Men, why are you doing¦94172 all these things? We are only humans¦94179 just like all of you. We were bringing you the good message about abandoning these useless¦94190 \add sacrifices\add* and turning¦94192 to the living¦94198 \nd God¦94196\nd* who made heaven¦94204 and the earth¦94207 and the sea¦94210 and everything in them.\x + \xo 14:15: \xt Exo 20:11.\x*
\v 16 In previous generations¦94221 he allowed¦94222 all the nations¦94226 to go their¦94230 own different ways¦94229,
\v 17 but he never left himself without¦94236 evidence of himself—sending good¦94242 rains¦94246 from heaven¦94243 to give you all fruitful¦94251 seasons¦94250 with food to fill \add your stomachs\add* and happiness to fill your hearts¦94257.”
\v 18 By saying¦94262 these¦94261 things¦94261, they¦94265 were eventually just able to restrain¦94265 the people from sacrificing¦94271 to them.
\p
\v 19 But some \add strict\add* Jews¦94297 came over from \add Pisidian\add* Antioch¦94289 and Iconium and were able to persuade¦94302 the crowds¦94306. They threw rocks at Paul¦94323 \add to kill him\add* and dragged¦94325 his body outside¦94327 the city¦94329 \add gates\add* thinking¦94330 that he was dead.
\v 20 But as the believers were standing around him, Paul got up and went back into the city¦94349, but he left¦94354 again with Barnabas¦94357 the next day¦94351 and went to Derbe.

\p
\v 21 They preached¦94360 the good¦94360 message¦94360 in Derbe, and after giving further training¦94372 to many of them, they¦94376 returned¦94376 to Lystra and Iconium and Antioch¦94386.
\v 22 There they strengthened¦94387 the faith¦94398 of the believers—encouraging them to continue believing and¦94399 to expect that it's normal to endure a lot of suffering on the path to God's kingdom¦94411.
\v 23 They appointed some elders for \add each\add* assembly¦94419, then they fasted and prayed¦94421 for the elders—asking the \nd master¦94428\nd* that they believed¦94431 in to look after them.
\p
\v 24 After passing through¦94434 Pisidia¦94438, they¦94439 arrived at Pamphylia
\v 25 and¦94444 after teaching the master's message¦94452 in Perga¦94449, they¦94455 went down to \add the coastal city of\add* Attalia¦94457.
\v 26 From there¦94460, they sailed¦94461 \add back\add* to \add Syrian\add* Antioch¦94463 where the congregation had prayed for God's grace¦94468 to be with them\x + \xo 14:26: \xt 13:3.\x*for the work they had just fulfilled¦94475.
\p
\v 27 So when they arrived¦94476, they gathered¦94479 the assembly¦94482 together¦94479 there and shared about what \nd God¦94488\nd* had done with them and how he had opened¦94497 up the door¦94500 of faith¦94501 to the non-Jews¦94499.
\v 28 Then they¦94502 stayed on with them there for quite a while.
\c 15
\s1 The decision from the Yerusalem elders
\rem /s1 The Meeting at Jerusalem
\rem /s1 The Council at Jerusalem
\p
\v 1 Then some \add people\add* came \add to Antioch\add* from Yudea and were teaching the believers¦94519 that according to Moses' teachings, you can't be saved¦94536 unless you've been circumcised¦94525.
\v 2 This led to no end of argument and debate¦94544 between them and Paul¦94548 and Barnabas until it was decided that the two of them and some other¦94583 believers should go to Yerusalem¦94596 to ask the missionaries and the elders¦94594 there about¦94601 this issue.
\p
\v 3 So indeed¦94606 the assembly¦94611 sent¦94608 the group on their way, and as they passed through¦94612 Phoenicia and Samaria¦94618, they described¦94620 how non-Jews¦94624 had become believers and this news made the believers there¦94607 very happy.
\p
\v 4 When they arrived¦94632 in Yerusalem¦94635, they were welcomed by the assembly¦94644 and the missionaries and the elders¦94650, and they explained how \nd God¦94657\nd* had used them.
\v 5 But some of the believers¦94681 who were also members of the Pharisee¦94680 party¦94680 stood up and said, “It's quite proper for them to be circumcised¦94685 and to be commanded¦94687 to keep the Jewish religious laws.”
\p
\v 6 So the missionaries and¦94699 the elders¦94701 met separately in order to consider the matter¦94705 further.
\v 7 After a lot of debate¦94710, Peter stood¦94737 up and said, “Men, brothers¦94747, all of you here know that some time back, \nd God¦94759\nd* chose¦94757 me to be a mouthpiece¦94765 so that the non-Jews¦94769 could hear the good message and believe¦94775.
\v 8 And \nd God¦94781\nd* who knows even people's inner thoughts, gave them the same holy \nd spirit¦94791\nd* that he gave us,
\v 9 and when he purified¦94807 their¦94810 minds by the faith¦94806, he didn't do anything different for them than he did for us.
\v 10 So why are you¦94814 all provoking \nd God¦94816\nd* by putting a load on the shoulders of these believers that neither¦94825 we¦94830, nor our¦94828 ancestors¦94827, were ever able to bear?
\v 11 But we¦94841 ourselves have believed¦94841 thanks to the grace¦94836 of \nd Yeshua¦94839\nd* the \nd master¦94838\nd*, and they can be saved¦94843 in just the same way.”
\p
\v 12 The whole group sat in silence¦94857, and then they listened to Barnabas¦94865 and Paul¦94868 as they described everything that \nd God¦94875\nd* had done among¦94879 the non-Jews¦94881 through them, including miracles and amazing things.
\v 13 Then while they were still silent¦94887, Yacob¦94891 responded, “Men, brothers¦94895, listen to me.
\v 14 Simon Peter has told us how \nd God¦94903\nd* first¦94901 intervened in order to select a people¦94909 for himself from among the non-Jews¦94907.
\v 15 And this actually agrees¦94917 with the message¦94920 that the prophets¦94922 recorded,
\q1
\v 16 ‘After¦94925 these¦94927 things¦94927 have happened I will return¦94929,
\q1 and I will rebuild the worship tent from David's time that has collapsed,
\q1 Although it was overturned¦94940, I will rebuild and restore¦94946 it,
\q1
\v 17 so that the remaining people¦94954 will want to find the master,
\q1 and also the non-Jews¦94961 who cried out to me.
\q1 The master who is doing¦94973 these¦94975 things¦94975 is saying¦94970 this,
\q1
\v 18 and planned it this way from eternity¦94980.’
\p
\v 19 Because of this, my ruling is not to be troubling¦94995 the non-Jews¦94999 who are turning¦95000 back to \nd God¦95003\nd*,
\v 20 but to write¦95005 to them to keep away from anything polluted¦95011 by idols¦95013, from sexual¦95016 immorality¦95016, and from strangled¦95019 animals¦95019 and \add eating or drinking\add* blood¦95022.
\v 21 Moses' writings have been preached in every city¦95039 and are read in \add our\add* meeting¦95051 halls¦95051 on every Rest Day.
\s1 The letter is carried to Antioch
\rem /s1 The Letter for Gentile Believers
\rem /s1 The Letter to the Gentile Believers

\p
\v 22 So the missionaries and elders¦95063 with all the assembly¦95067 decided to choose some men to accompany Paul¦95077 and Barnabas¦95079 to Antioch¦95074, so they chose¦95068 Yudas (nicknamed Barsabbas¦95084) and Silas¦95087 who were leaders among¦95091 the believers¦95093,
\v 23 This is what they wrote: This letter is from the missionaries and elders¦95107, your brothers \add here in Yerusalem\add* to our non-Jewish fellow believers¦95110 in Antioch¦95114 and Syria and Cilicia.
\v 24 Since¦95128 we heard¦95131 that some people who weren't sent by us came from here and disturbed¦95139 you all with their upsetting¦95142 messages¦95141,
\v 25 we unanimously agreed to select some men¦95161 to accompany our¦95169 dear \add friends\add* Barnabas¦95170 and¦95171 Paul¦95172 back.
\v 26 These are men¦95173 who have dedicated their¦95180 lives¦95178 to our¦95186 \nd master¦95185\nd*, \nd Yeshua¦95187\nd* the \nd messiah¦95188\nd*.
\v 27 So we've sent¦95192 Yudas and Silas¦95196 and they'll confirm in person what we are writing.
\v 28 It seemed right to the holy \nd spirit¦95209\nd* and¦95213 to us to not burden¦95222 you¦95221 all with anything more than the following commands:
\v 29 you all must keep away from anything sacrificed¦95229 to idols, from \add eating or drinking\add* blood¦95231 or strangled¦95234 animals¦95234, and from sexual¦95236 immorality¦95236. You will do well if you avoid these things¦95229. Farewell.
\p
\v 30 So they were sent¦95262 off and when they arrived at Antioch¦95269, they gathered¦95271 the believers and handed¦95275 across the letter¦95277,
\v 31 and when they read it¦95278, they were very happy with the encouraging contents.
\p
\v 32 Yudas and Barnabas were both prophets¦95291, and said a lot to encourage them and strengthen¦95305 \add their faith\add*.
\v 33 After they'd stayed there¦95309 for a while, the believers¦95315 sent them home carrying greetings from them to the assembly \add back in Yerusalem\add*.
\p
\v 34 ≈
\v 35 But Paul¦95337 and Barnabas¦95340 stayed on there in Antioch¦95343, teaching¦95344 them and preaching¦95346 the good message along with many others¦95350.
\s1 Paul and Barnabas go separate ways
\rem /s1 Paul and Barnabas Separate
\rem /s1 Disagreement Between Paul and Barnabas
\p
\v 36 After a few days¦95359, Paul¦95365 suggested to Barnabas¦95364, “Let's go back and visit¦95369 the believers¦95371 in each city¦95376 where we proclaimed¦95382 the \nd master's¦95386\nd* message¦95384, and see how they're doing.”
\v 37 Barnabas¦95389 agreed and wanted to take¦95394 Yohan¦95398 Mark¦95402 along¦95394 with them as well,
\v 38 but Paul¦95403 didn't want to take him because he had left them in Pamphylia¦95416 instead of continuing with them in their work.
\v 39 And so it turned into such a disagreement that the two of them each went their different ways. Barnabas¦95447 took Yohan Mark with him and¦95446 sailed to Cyprus
\v 40 while Paul¦95458 chose¦95461 Silas¦95462 and they left¦95463 after being entrusted to the \nd master's¦95468\nd* grace¦95466 by the believers¦95473.
\v 41 They went through¦95474 Syria and¦95481 Cilicia, strengthening¦95486 the assemblies¦95488 there.
\c 16
\s1 Paul and Silas also take Timothy with them
\rem /s1 Timothy Joins Paul and Silas

\rem /s1 Paul's Second Missionary Journey
\p
\v 1 Then Paul went to Derbe and¦95504 then on to Lystra where a believer named Timothy¦95515 lived. His mother was a Jewish believer, but¦95522 his father¦95521 was Greek.
\v 2 The believers¦95533 in Lystra and¦95530 Iconium spoke well of Timothy
\v 3 and Paul¦95537 wanted¦95535 him to accompany them on his trip so he circumcised¦95545 him \add in advance\add* because¦95548 of the Jews¦95550 in that region—everyone knew that his father¦95565 was a Greek¦95562.
\v 4 As they passed through¦95574 various towns, they explained the decision of the missionaries and elders¦95604 in Yerusalem¦95608 about which commands they must adhere to.
\v 5 So the assemblies¦95612 were strengthened¦95613 in this way and¦95616 their numbers¦95619 were increasing each day¦95621.

\p
\v 6 From there, they¦95623 travelled through¦95623 Phrygia and¦95627 the Galatia¦95629 region¦95630, after the holy \nd spirit¦95635\nd* prevented them from proclaiming the message¦95639 in Asia \add Minor\add*.
\v 7 When they got to Mysia, they planned to go on into Bithynia, but \nd Yeshua's¦95667 spirit¦95665\nd* didn't let them,
\v 8 so after leaving Mysia they¦95674 went to Troas.
\v 9 During the night¦95683, Paul¦95686 had a vision¦95679 of a Macedonian man¦95689 standing there and imploring¦95698 him¦95699, “Come on to Macedonia¦95690 and help¦95707 us here.”
\v 10 So as a result of the vision¦95715, we¦95722 decided to go straight to Macedonia¦95726, concluding¦95727 that \nd God¦95732\nd* had called¦95729 us to share the good message with them.

\p
\v 11 From Troas we¦95750 sailed directly to Samothrace¦95752, and¦95755 then on to Neapolis the following¦95757 day¦95754.
\v 12 From there¦95763 we continued on to Philippi which¦95768 is a \add Roman\add* colony¦95778 and the capital city of the Macedonia¦95776 district¦95774 where we stayed for several days.
\v 13 On the Rest Days, we went \add down\add* to the river¦95803 outside¦95797 the \add city\add* gate where¦95804 we thought people might be praying, and we spoke to the women¦95819 who had met there.
\v 14 One of them was Lydia from Thyatira who was a seller¦95825 of purple goods\f + \fr 16:14 \ft It's possible that Lydia dyed fabric and sold it, or that she actually made and sold the purple dye itself.\f* and although she already worshipped¦95829 \nd God¦95832\nd*, the \nd master¦95837\nd* opened¦95838 her¦95839 mind¦95840 and she readily accepted what Paul¦95846 was saying.
\v 15 So then Lydia and her¦95854 household were all \add ceremonially\add* immersed¦95849, and then she requested, “If you all consider me to be faithful¦95860 to the \nd master¦95863\nd*, come¦95865 and stay at my¦95871 place.” So she persuaded us.
\s1 Paul and Silas get thrown into prison
\rem /s1 In Prison at Philippi
\rem /s1 Paul and Silas in Prison
\p
\v 16 One time as we were walking to the prayer¦95884 meeting, we met a female slave who was possessed by a spirit¦95889 that enabled her to tell fortunes¦95906, and thanks to that, to earn a lot of money for her masters¦95902.
\v 17 She¦95912 walked along behind us and shouted out, “These¦95919 men¦95921 are slaves¦95922 of the highest¦95926 \nd god¦95924\nd* and they will be telling you¦95931 all how to be saved.”
\v 18 After she'd done this for several days¦95940, Paul¦95945 was so frustrated that he turned¦95947 around and spoke to the spirit¦95949 \add in her\add*, “I command¦95953 you by the authority of \nd Yeshua¦95958\nd* the \nd messiah¦95959\nd* to leave her.”
\p
\v 19 But when her¦95982 masters¦95981 realised that their¦95992 profitable business¦95991 was about to come to an end, they¦96003 grabbed Paul¦95999 and Silas¦96002 and dragged¦96003 them to the authorities at the marketplace¦96006.
\v 20 They brought¦96011 them forward¦96011 to face the magistrates and¦96010 said¦96016, “These¦96018 Jews¦96026 are disturbing¦96021 \add the peace\add* in our¦96023 city¦96025
\v 21 and¦96028 teaching behaviour that we as Romans can neither accept¦96038 nor practice¦96042.”
\v 22 An \add angry\add* crowd¦96050 gathered around and the magistrates ordered for Paul and Silas to have their¦96060 robes¦96062 torn off and then to be beaten with rods.
\v 23 They were severely beaten and then thrown¦96071 into prison where the officer was commanded¦96074 to keep them secure¦96079.
\v 24 Because of that, he threw them into the inner¦96095 cell and locked their¦96098 feet¦96099 in stocks¦96108.
\p
\v 25 Around midnight¦96113 Paul¦96118 and Silas¦96121 were praying¦96122 and singing¦96123 praises to \nd God¦96125\nd*, and the other prisoners¦96132 were listening¦96126 to them.
\v 26 Suddenly there was a strong earthquake¦96135 that shook even the foundations¦96141 of the prison, and immediately¦96149 all the prison doors¦96151 opened¦96144 up and the chains of all the prisoners came loose.
\v 27 The prison officer woke up, and when he saw that all the prison doors¦96169 were open, he drew his sword¦96176 to take his own life as he figured that all the prisoners must have escaped¦96183.
\v 28 But Paul¦96193 shouted out, “Don't harm yourself¦96197! We're all still here!”
\p
\v 29 The officer called for torches, then rushed¦96209 in and knelt down trembling¦96211 in front of Paul¦96219 and Silas¦96222.
\v 30 Then he escorted them out and asked, “Masters¦96236, what do I need to do to be saved¦96242?”
\p
\v 31 “Believe¦96247 in the \nd master¦96251 Yeshua¦96252\nd*,” they replied, “then you and your¦96260 household¦96259 can all be saved¦96255.”
\v 32 Then they explained the message¦96265 about the \nd master¦96268\nd* to him and all those in his¦96276 household¦96275.
\v 33 Even though it was still the middle of the night¦96286, he sponged their¦96290 wounds¦96291, and then him and his¦96302 household were all immersed¦96294 straight away.
\v 34 He took Paul and Silas up into his house¦96314 and gave them a meal, and his whole household were happy because¦96318 they now believed¦96327 in \nd God¦96331\nd*.
\p
\v 35 The next day¦96333 the magistrates sent¦96337 officials¦96340 to tell the jailer to release Paul and Silas.
\p
\v 36 So the officer told Paul¦96380, “The magistrates \add sent these officials\add* to order¦96387 that you two to be released.”
\p
\v 37 But Paul¦96399 responded, “You mean that after publicly¦96406 beating us Roman men¦96408 without a trial, they threw us into prison¦96416 and now they want to just quietly release us.”
\p
\v 38 So the officials¦96436 reported¦96429 this back to the magistrates, and they were quite afraid¦96450 when they heard¦96453 that Paul and Silas were Roman \add citizens\add*.
\v 39 So now they came to the prison in person, and appealed¦96467 to them, and escorting them out of prison themselves, asked them to please leave the city¦96491.
\v 40 So after Paul and Silas left the prison¦96506, they went to see Lydia and after encouraging the believers¦96517 there, they left.

\p
\v 1 After travelling¦96529 through¦96529 Amphipolis and Apollonia¦96536, Paul and Silas went to Thessalonica¦96544 where¦96545 there was a Jewish¦96548 meeting¦96548 hall¦96548.
\v 2 Paul's custom was to attend at the local meeting hall on the Rest Day, so he did that, and for three weekends in a row he discussed¦96567 the scriptures¦96574 with them,
\v 3 showing them how that it¦96581 \add had been written\add* that the messiah would suffer¦96582 and be killed and come back to life, and then explaining, “This \nd Yeshua¦96594\nd* that I've been telling you¦96599 about is the messiah.”
\v 4 Some of them were persuaded¦96604 and joined¦96606 with Paul¦96608 and Silas¦96611, along with a big group of godly Greeks and quite a few prominent women¦96625.
\p
\v 5 But some of the other Jews¦96638 were envious \add of them\add*, and enlisted some of the troublemakers from the marketplaces¦96645 to form a mob. They stirred up all the people, and looking¦96664 for¦96664 Paul and Silas so they could bring¦96667 them out, arrived at the house¦96662 of a man named Jason.
\v 6 But when they realised that Paul and Silas weren't there, they dragged¦96676 Jason and some other believers¦96685 off to the city¦96688 leaders, shouting¦96689, “Those two men who've gone around upsetting¦96697 the whole world¦96696 have now come here as well
\v 7 and Jason has welcomed¦96704 them \add into his house\add*. They rebel against Caesar's decrees¦96711 and claim that \nd Yeshua¦96720\nd* is a rival king¦96715.
\v 8 They stirred up the crowd¦96726 and¦96727 the city¦96729 leaders with these¦96735 accusations,
\v 9 so the leaders collected a heavy fine from Jason¦96742 and the others, and then released them.

\p
\v 10 So the believers¦96750 immediately¦96751 sent¦96756 Paul¦96759 and¦96760 Silas¦96762 off during the night¦96755 to go to Berea. In Berea they also attended at the Jewish¦96770 meeting¦96770 hall¦96770
\v 11 and this group were more upper-class than the congregation in Thessalonica¦96783. They eagerly accepted the message¦96787 and examined¦96794 the scriptures¦96796 every¦96792 day¦96793 to check if what was being taught matched what was written there.
\v 12 Because it did, many of the people believed¦96810 including quite a few of the prominent¦96822 Greeks.
\v 13 But when the Jews¦96839 from Thessalonica¦96838 found out that God's message¦96850 was also being proclaimed¦96845 by Paul¦96848 there¦96863 in Berea, they¦96859 soon turned up to agitate¦96864 and¦96865 stir the crowds¦96868.
\v 14 So the believers¦96880 immediately¦96871 sent¦96878 Paul¦96877 off to the coast, but Silas¦96896 and Timothy¦96899 both stayed.
\v 15 The ones guiding Paul¦96907 took him to Athens before they headed back with his instructions for Silas¦96931 and Timothy¦96934 to come¦96941 and join him again as soon as possible.

\p
\v 16 While Paul¦96954 stayed in Athens waiting for them, he was upset in his¦96958 spirit¦96957 as he observed¦96962 how idolatrous¦96963 the people were.
\v 17 So while he stayed busy having discussions¦96967 with the Jews¦96974 and other worshippers¦96977 from the meeting¦96972 hall¦96972, he also spent time every¦96984 day¦96985 with anyone who just happened¦96988 to be around in the marketplace¦96982.
\v 18 Some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers¦96997 enjoyed discussing things with him, but others just mocked him, “What does this babbler¦97009 want to talk about now?”
\p But others said, “Seems that he's talking¦97003 about strange¦97015 demons¦97016,” because¦97020 he was preaching¦97027 the good¦97027 message¦97027 about \nd Yeshua¦97022\nd* and coming back to life.
\v 19 So they grabbed him and brought¦97043 him to the Aries Hill \add where the council sat\add* and asked, “Are we allowed to know¦97049 what this new teaching¦97060 that you're bringing is about?
\v 20 It seems that you¦97065 have some surprising¦97061 ideas for our¦97072 ears¦97071, so we¦97073 want to hear what it's all about.”
\v 21 (Everyone in Athens and¦97086 even visitors¦97088 often took the opportunity¦97095 either to explain or to listen to any new things.)
\p
\v 22 So Paul¦97108 stood¦97105 up in the middle of the gathering on the hill and spoke, “Men of Athens, I've noticed how you¦97122 all are very religious,
\v 23 because as I was looking around and observing¦97128 your¦97132 objects¦97131 of worship, I even discovered an altar¦97135 that was inscribed¦97140, ‘To the unknown¦97141 \nd god¦97142\nd*.’ So without knowing¦97146 it, you already worship this \nd God¦97142\nd* that I'm going to tell you about.
\v 24 This \nd God¦97155\nd* who created the earth and everything in it¦97164 is the \nd master¦97171\nd* of heaven¦97166 and earth. He doesn't live in man-made temples¦97175
\v 25 nor can he be repaired by any human¦97183 hands¦97182 and he doesn't need to be fed. \add On the contrary\add*, he's the one who gives life¦97197 and breath¦97199 and who gives us everything that we need.
\v 26 From one man he made every¦97209 nationality¦97210 that lives across all the earth¦97221 and designated¦97222 their boundaries¦97229 and their futures.
\v 27 He made them so that they would try to discover \nd God¦97238\nd*, and if they did search for him they might find him as he's not far from any one of us
\v 28 because
\q1 ‘We live in him and are moved¦97273 by him and exist through him.’
\m Even some of your own poets¦97288 wrote,
\q1 ‘We are all descended¦97294 from just one.’
\m
\v 29 So since we are God's offspring, we shouldn't be putting gold¦97305 or silver¦97309 or stone¦97311 craftsmanship¦97313 in the same class as the divine¦97319.
\v 30 In fact \nd God¦97332\nd* overlooked¦97330 times¦97325 of such ignorance¦97327 in the past, but now he's informing everyone¦97343 and requiring them to repent¦97344
\v 31 because he's set a date for when he's going¦97352 to be fairly judging¦97353 the world¦97356. He's already appointed the judge who everyone can have faith¦97364 in because he brought¦97365 him back to life from the dead¦97371.
\p
\v 32 When they heard¦97372 about a dead¦97375 person coming back to life, some started mocking¦97378 but others¦97380 said¦97381, “We'd like to hear¦97383 more about this from you¦97384 another time.”
\v 33 So Paul¦97393 left¦97394 at that stage
\v 34 but some people joined¦97401 with him¦97403 and believed¦97404, including Dionysius who was a council member, a woman¦97414 named Damaris¦97416, and others¦97418 as well.

\p
\v 1 After¦97423 this, Paul left Athens and travelled to Corinth.
\v 2 There he came across a Jew¦97439 named Aquila who had been born in Pontus¦97442 but who had recently¦97445 moved from Italy along with his¦97454 wife¦97453 Priscilla because¦97455 \add Emperor\add* Claudius had ordered all Jews¦97464 to leave Rome. So Paul approached¦97475 them,
\v 3 and since they worked in the same¦97483 trade¦97483, he ended up staying with them and they worked together in their craft¦97498 of tent-making.
\v 4 On every¦97510 Rest Day, Paul debated in the Jewish¦97507 meeting¦97507 hall¦97507, and was persuading¦97521 both Jews¦97526 and Greeks.
\p
\v 5 However when Silas¦97540 and¦97541 Timothy¦97543 arrived from Macedonia¦97536, Paul¦97549 was able to devote his full time to the message¦97546—demonstrating to the Jews¦97553 that \nd Yeshua¦97558\nd* is the \add promised\add* \nd messiah¦97556\nd*.
\v 6 But when they opposed¦97566 \add the message\add* and made false accusations, he \add publicly\add* brushed \add the dust\add* off his clothes¦97577\f + \fr 18:6 \ft In the culture, this was a demonstration that you're not responsible for their decision(s).\f* and said¦97579, “Your¦97584 future deaths are your own problem. I'm innocent \add of your guilt.\add* From now on, I'll going¦97598 to the non-Jews¦97597.”
\v 7 So Paul left there¦97605, and went to stay at the house of a man named Titus Justus¦97617 who worshipped¦97618 \nd God¦97620\nd* and whose house was next-door to the meeting¦97627 hall¦97627.
\v 8 Krispo¦97628 the meeting¦97632 hall¦97632 leader¦97632 and all his¦97644 household¦97643 decided to follow the \nd master¦97638\nd*, and many of the Corinthians¦97648 believed¦97634 after they heard \add the message\add* and were immersed¦97652.
\p
\v 9 Then the \nd master¦97667\nd* spoke to Paul¦97676 one night¦97669 in a vision¦97671, “Don't be afraid and¦97683 stay silent¦97685, but¦97681 keep¦97685 speaking¦97682 out
\v 10 because I am with you and no one can mistreat¦97697 you here because there¦97701 are many of my people¦97700 in this city¦97706.”
\v 11 So Paul stayed on for eighteen months¦97718, teaching¦97720 God's message¦97725 to the people there.
\p
\v 12 Then at the time when Gallio¦97728 was the proconsul¦97732 of Achaia, the Jews¦97739 united against Paul¦97747 and¦97749 brought a case to the tribunal¦97758 against him¦97754
\v 13 saying¦97761, “This man¦97768 is going against the law by persuading¦97767 people¦97770 to be worshipping¦97771 \add his\add* \nd God¦97773\nd*.”
\p
\v 14 But as Paul¦97777 opening¦97778 his mouth¦97780 to speak, Gallio¦97783 said¦97781 to the Jews, “I would have accepted this charge if it¦97791 was a serious wrong¦97793 or evil¦97797 crime¦97796 and would have listened to you¦97806 Jews.
\v 15 However, since it's a question¦97811 about¦97814 a message¦97815 and names¦97817 and your own law, you all can see to it yourselves¦97824 because I don't¦97829 want to get involved in judging things¦97828 like that.”
\v 16 So he sent them away from the tribunal¦97839,
\v 17 but they¦97850 grabbed Sosthenes, the leader¦97849 from the meeting¦97849 hall¦97849, and beat him¦97850 up right there in front of the tribunal¦97853. But Gallio¦97859 took action to stop them.

\v 18 Paul¦97864 stayed on for quite a few days¦97868 after that, then he farewelled the believers¦97871 and went to Cenchrea where he had his hair cut as was the custom for someone making a vow. Then taking Priscilla and Aquila with him, he sailed towards Syria.
\v 19 When they arrived¦97895 at Ephesus¦97900, he left the other two there while he went into the Jewish¦97916 meeting¦97916 hall¦97916 and had a discussion¦97919 with the Jews¦97921 there.
\v 20 They asked him¦97922 to remain¦97930 longer, but he¦97934 turned them down
\v 21 although as he gave his farewells, he said¦97940, “I'll come back here again if \nd God¦97959\nd* wills it,” then he sailed on from Ephesus¦97967.
\p
\v 22 When he landed at Caesarea¦97971, he went \add to Yerusalem\add* and greeted¦97975 the assembly¦97977 there before continuing on to Antioch¦97980.
\v 23 He stayed there for some time¦97983 before travelling through the regions¦97991 of Galatia¦97990 and¦97992 Phrygia strengthening¦97996 \add the faith of\add* the believers \add through his teaching\add*.

\p
\v 24 Meanwhile a Jewish man¦98011 named Apollos¦98004 (who had been born in \add the city of\add* Alexandria¦98007) arrived¦98013 in Ephesus¦98015. He knew the \add Hebrew\add* scriptures¦98020 well
\v 25 and had been taught¦98043 about the \nd master's¦98033\nd* way¦98030. Being¦98054 a very enthusiastic person, he started teaching¦98043 about \nd Yeshua¦98048\nd*, even though he didn't know about being¦98035 filled with the spirit¦98037.\x + \xo 18:25: \xt 2:1-4.\x*
\v 26 So Apollos started speaking¦98058 out boldly¦98058 in the Jewish¦98061 meeting¦98061 hall¦98061. Priscilla and Aquila listened to him, then asked to speak with him privately and explained¦98078 God's way¦98080 more accurately.
\v 27 Now Apollos wanted to go to Achaia, so the believers encouraged¦98125 him and sent a letter ahead of him to tell the believers there to welcome¦98131 him, so when he arrived¦98134 there, he was able to contribute¦98137 a lot to those who through God's grace¦98147 had also become believers.
\v 28 Apollos was \add also\add* able to thoroughly¦98152 refute¦98152 the arguments of the Jews¦98151 and used the scriptures¦98159 to show that \nd Yeshua¦98164\nd* is the \nd messiah¦98162\nd*.
\c 19
\s1 Many filled with the spirit in Ephesus
\rem /s1 Paul's Third Missionary Journey
\rem /s1 Paul in Ephesus
\p
\v 1 So then while Apollos¦98174 was at Corinth, Paul¦98179 travelled through¦98197 the interior regions before arriving at Ephesus¦98207. He found some followers there,
\v 2 and asked them if they had received¦98223 the holy spirit when they had \add first\add* believed¦98224 \add in Yeshua\add*.
\p They replied, “We hadn't even heard¦98239 that there's¦98238 a holy spirit.”
\p
\v 3 “So then what were you¦98251 immersed¦98251 into?” asked Paul.
\p “With Yohan's immersion¦98260,” they¦98252 answered.
\p
\v 4 Then Paul¦98264 said, “Yohan¦98265 immersed people¦98271 \add in water\add* with an immersion¦98268 that went with repentance¦98269 \add from their sins\add*, but he told them to believe in the one who would follow him, that is to believe in \nd Yeshua¦98285\nd*.”
\p
\v 5 When the followers heard¦98286 this, they¦98289 were immersed¦98289 \add in water again, this time proclaiming their faith\add* in \nd Yeshua¦98295\nd* the \nd master¦98294\nd*.
\v 6 Then Paul¦98307 placed his hands¦98309 on them \add and prayed\add* and the holy \nd spirit¦98314\nd* came¦98312 \add down\add* onto them and they started speaking in other languages¦98324 and speaking messages from God.
\v 7 There were about¦98333 twelve¦98334 men¦98332 in the group.
\rem /s1 Paul Ministers in Ephesus
\p
\v 8 So Paul started going to the Jewish¦98342 meeting¦98342 hall¦98342 and for the next three¦98349 months¦98348 he boldly¦98346 discussed¦98350 and persuaded¦98352 them about God's kingdom¦98356.
\v 9 But as some of them refused to believe and became hardened¦98365 against his teaching and started telling everyone¦98386 that the \add Yeshua\add* way¦98370 was evil¦98368, Paul stopped teaching in the meeting hall and taught the followers at Turannos'¦98392 school¦98391 instead.
\v 10 This went on for two¦98405 years¦98404 to the point that everyone in Asia \add Minor\add*, whether Jews¦98426 or Greeks, heard the message¦98421 about Yeshua.
\s1 The power of the master's message
\rem /s1 The Sons of Sceva
\p
\v 11 And \nd God¦98440\nd* was doing¦98441 incredible miracles¦98432 through Paul¦98445
\v 12 such that even if handkerchiefs¦98457 or aprons¦98460 that had touched his¦98456 skin were placed on top of any person who was sick or troubled with demons, then they would recover and the evil¦98471 spirits¦98469 would leave them.
\v 13 But some of the Jewish exorcists¦98486 going¦98483 around¦98483 attempted¦98476 to use the name¦98496 of Yeshua to drive out evil¦98494 spirits¦98492 by telling them, “I am imploring¦98503 you¦98504 all by Yeshua that Paul¦98511 preaches about.”
\v 14 Seven sons¦98528 of the Jewish chief¦98525 priest¦98525, Sceva were doing¦98533 this.
\p
\v 15 But the evil¦98570 spirit¦98568 would answer¦98564 them saying, “I know \nd Yeshua¦98575\nd* and¦98577 I recognise¦98580 Paul¦98579, but¦98582 who are you¦98581?”
\p
\v 16 Then the man¦98593 who had the evil¦98602 spirit¦98600 would jump on them and beat them up so they'd end up escaping¦98617 out of the house¦98621 naked¦98614 and wounded¦98616.
\v 17 When everyone in Ephesus¦98635 heard about this, both Jews¦98628 and Greeks were frightened, and the name¦98648 of \nd Yeshua¦98651\nd* the \nd master¦98650\nd* was being¦98646 honoured.
\v 18 Many of the people who believed¦98656 \add in Yeshua\add* came and confessed¦98659 \add their¦98664 sins\add* and wrong practices¦98663.
\v 19 Lots of the people who'd practiced¦98672 magic¦98671 brought¦98673 their¦98675 scrolls¦98676 and burnt them in front of the others. When the values of all of these were added up, it was \add huge\add*—worth around 50,000 silver¦98687 \add coins\add*.
\v 20 So that was how the \nd master's¦98700\nd* message¦98703 had a powerful¦98692 effect and¦98705 won over many people.
\s1 The silversmiths start a ruckus in Ephesus
\rem /s1 The Riot in Ephesus
\p
\v 21 After all of this, Paul¦98716 decided in his \nd spirit¦98720\nd* that he would need to travel through¦98721 Macedonia¦98724 and Achaia enroute to Yerusalem¦98732, saying, “After I've been there¦98739 a while, I will also need to go to Rome.”
\v 22 He sent¦98746 two¦98751 of his workers, Timothy¦98758 and Eratos, to Macedonia¦98750 while he stayed on a bit longer in Asia \add Minor\add*.
\rem /s1 The Riot in Ephesus
\p
\v 23 But while he was still there, a major disturbance¦98777 hit the Yeshua followers.
\v 24 A silversmith¦98788 named Demetrius¦98783 made \add little¦98802\add* silver¦98792 shrines of Artemis¦98794 and this business¦98803 brought a tidy profit to the local craftsmen¦98799.
\v 25 Demetrius gathered all the workers¦98814 together¦98806 and told them, “Men, you¦98822 all know that our prosperity¦98829 comes from this business¦98827 of ours.
\v 26 But you've seen yourselves and heard from others that not only Ephesus¦98844, but almost¦98847 our entire¦98834 \add province of\add* Asia \add Minor\add* has become¦98870 persuaded¦98856 by this Paul¦98852 fellow, and now the crowds¦98860 are saying¦98861 that what we make are not \add real\add* gods¦98866.
\v 27 However it's not only us and our trade¦98881 that is coming into disrepute¦98885, but the temple¦98895 of the great goddess¦98892 Artemis is considered to be useless. This could result in a loss of power for the great Artemis that all of Asia \add Minor\add* and the inhabited¦98920 world¦98920 have been worshipping¦98921.”
\p
\v 28 When the gathering heard¦98923 this, they¦98934 became very angry and¦98926 yelled out, “Artemis¦98938 of the Ephesians is great!”
\v 29 Then the \add whole\add* city¦98945 was filled¦98941 with confusion¦98948 and the people rushed¦98950 to the theatre¦98956 and grabbed Gaius¦98959 and Aristarchus¦98961 from Macedonia¦98962—travelling¦98964 companions¦98964 of Paul's.
\v 30 Now Paul¦98968 wanted to go there and speak to the crowd, but the believers wouldn't let him¦98980 go.
\v 31 Also some of the leaders from Asia \add Minor\add* who were friendly¦98992 towards him, sent¦98993 messengers to him to implore¦98996 him not to go to the theatre¦99003.
\v 32 Some of the people gathered there were yelling out something, but overall it was just confusion, and¦99017 the majority of the people couldn't even tell you the reason why they¦99026 were there.
\v 33 Some people in the crowd¦99030 selected Alexander the Jew and sent him forward¦99035 to speak, so he motioned with his hand¦99047 ready to explain the situation to the people.
\v 34 But as soon as they recognised¦99054 that he was a Jew¦99058, people started yelling, “Artemis¦99074 of the Ephesians is great,” and this continued for over two¦99069 hours¦99068.
\p
\v 35 Eventually the city¦99105 administrator was able to calm the crowd¦99086 and tell them, “Men, fellow Ephesians, what person from around here doesn't know that it's Ephesus¦99092 that's the temple¦99106 keeper¦99106 of the great¦99111 Artemis¦99113 and of this image¦99116 that fell down from Zeus?
\v 36 Since all of this is unquestionable¦99117, it¦99123 makes sense for everyone to calm down and¦99127 not do anything reckless¦99129.
\v 37 These men¦99135 that you¦99132 presented here haven't stolen anything from the temple¦99140, nor have they slandered¦99143 our¦99147 goddess¦99145.
\v 38 So if Demetrius¦99152 and the silver craftsmen¦99160 with him¦99159 have a case against anyone¦99164,, they should bring it to the courts¦99167 and the proconsuls¦99170 and register the charges.
\v 39 But for the rest of you, if you have a grievance against others¦99175, it¦99190 needs to be settled¦99190 in a lawful¦99187 assembly¦99189
\v 40 because we're in danger¦99193 of being charged with insurrection¦99196 about what happened today¦99199. And we would have no defence that we could respond with concerning this disorderly¦99214 gathering¦99214.” Then he told them all to go home.

\v 1 After all the commotion¦99227 had died down, Paul¦99231 sent¦99228 for the believers, and after¦99222 greeting¦99239 and encouraging them, he left¦99241 \add Ephesus\add* to go to Macedonia¦99246.\f + \fr 20:1 \ft As he'd already decided—see 19:21.\f*
\v 2 As he travelled through¦99247 the districts¦99251, he challenged the people there with a lot of messages, until he eventually arrived in Greece.
\v 3 He'd been there about three¦99268 months¦99267 when he heard about a plot by some Jews¦99277 to waylay him as he boarded a ship to return to Syria, so instead he decided to return through¦99295 Macedonia¦99297
\v 4 with Sopater son of Pyrrhus¦99310 from Berea, Aristarchus¦99314 and Secundus from Thessalonica¦99312, Gaius¦99318 from Derbe, Tychicus and Trophimus from the province of Asia \add Minor\add*, and Timothy¦99322 all accompanying¦99298 him¦99303.
\v 5 They went ahead and waited for us\f + \fr 20:5 \ft Luke (the writer) includes himself here.\f* at Troas.
\v 6 So we sailed¦99341 out from Philippi after the Feast of Flat Bread. We arrived and meet the others there at Troas after a five-day trip, and then stayed¦99366 on there for seven¦99368 days.

\v 7 On the Sunday we had gathered¦99377 together to break¦99382 bread¦99383 together and Paul¦99385 was discussing¦99386 many things with them. As he was scheduled to leave the next day, the meeting went on towards midnight¦99397
\v 8 and there¦99398 were many lamps¦99401 in the upper¦99405 room where¦99406 we¦99407 had all gathered¦99409.
\v 9 Now there was a young¦99414 man¦99414 named Eutychus who was sitting¦99410 on the window¦99420 sill, and as Paul¦99429 went on, he fell asleep and toppled down from the third¦99440 storey. The ones who reached him first thought he was dead¦99445,
\v 10 but Paul¦99449 had come¦99446 downstairs and bent over Eutychus and held him in his¦99465 arms and said¦99459 to the crowd, “Don't worry, he's still alive.”
\v 11 Then Paul went back up and broke¦99472 the bread¦99474 with the others, eating a little and continuing to talk with them until¦99482 leaving at daybreak¦99483.

\v 13 We went ahead to the ship¦99508 and departed for Assos¦99513 where it had been arranged that we'd pick up Paul¦99518 because¦99520 he wanted to walk there¦99514.
\v 14 So when we met him at Assos¦99539, he boarded the ship and we all sailed on to Mitylene.
\v 15 After we left Mitylene, we were out from Kios the next day, in Samos¦99559 the day after that, and then the following day we arrived at Miletus.
\v 16 Paul¦99575 had decided to sail¦99576 past Ephesus¦99578 because¦99592 he was hurrying¦99591 to try to get the Yerusalem¦99606 for the Day of Pentecost so he didn't want to spend¦99585 time¦99585 in Asia Minor.

\p
\v 17 So while we were at Miletus, he sent¦99612 a message to Ephesus¦99614 for the elders¦99618 of the assembly¦99620 to come to him.
\v 18 When they arrived¦99623, he told them, “You all know that from the very first¦99639 day¦99640 that I set foot¦99644 in Asia \add Minor\add* and for the entire¦99635 time¦99661 that I was there
\v 19 I humbly served the \nd master¦99666\nd* even through tears¦99674 and trials¦99676 when the Jews¦99685 plotted to destroy me.
\v 20 But I didn't shrink back from teaching you everything that would help you, whether I was teaching in public¦99699 or in individual homes¦99702.
\v 21 I explained to both Jews¦99707 and Greeks how they needed to turn their backs on their sins and towards \nd God¦99714\nd* with faith¦99717 in our¦99725 \nd master¦99723 Yeshua¦99726\nd* the \nd messiah¦99728\nd*.
\p
\v 22 However the \nd spirit¦99737\nd* is now forcing me towards Yerusalem¦99740 even though I don't¦99750 know what will happen to me there.
\v 23 I just know that recently in every¦99760 city¦99762, the holy \nd spirit¦99756\nd* tells me that chains and¦99771 hardships are waiting for me.
\v 24 But I've never regarded my own life as being valuable—I only want to reach the end of my life having served in the way that the \nd master¦99816 Yeshua¦99817\nd* instructed me to speak out the good message¦99823 about God's grace¦99825.
\p
\v 25 So you see, I know that all of you from here where I passed¦99846 through¦99846 proclaiming¦99847 God's kingdom¦99849, you will never see me again.
\v 26 That's why I'm declaring to all of you¦99858 today¦99862 that I'm not guilty of your judgement
\v 27 because¦99874 I didn't avoid telling you¦99886 anything that I had from \nd God¦99884\nd*.
\v 28 So now you elders look after your own lives and those of your flock¦99894 because the holy \nd spirit¦99899\nd* chose you as overseers¦99904 to shepherd¦99905 the assembly¦99907 of God's people who he paid for with his very own blood¦99918.
\v 29 I'm aware that after¦99928 I leave, vicious wolves¦99933 will come in amongst¦99935 you¦99936 and trying to steal the flock¦99940.
\v 30 Even some of you¦99943 will rise up and¦99941 teach a message that's warped but which will draw some of the believers away to follow it,
\v 31 so take great care. Remember that for three¦99961 years, I never stopped warning each of you along with my tears¦99970
\v 32 so now I am leaving you all in God's hands and with the message¦99987 of his¦99990 grace¦99989 which¦99991 is quite capable of helping you grow to receive the inheritance¦100000 that's for all those who've been purified.
\p
\v 33 I never envied anyone's gold¦100012 or silver¦100009 or \add fancy\add* clothes¦100014
\v 34 and you¦100020 yourselves¦100018 know that I laboured with my own hands¦100036 to cover my expenses and for those with me.
\v 35 Yes, I showed¦100042 you all that it's good to work and to take care of the weaker ones and to remember¦100052 the message¦100055 of the \nd master¦100057 Yeshua¦100058\nd* when he said¦100062 that it's better to be a giver than a taker.”
\p
\v 36 When he'd finished speaking, Paul knelt¦100075 down and prayed¦100082 with them all.
\v 37 Everyone¦100097 was sobbing as they¦100098 hugged and¦100091 kissed him¦100099
\v 38 because¦100102 what he had said about never seeing him again had really distressed¦100100 them. Then they accompanied¦100118 him to his¦100116 ship¦100124.

\p
\v 1 When it¦100128 was time for us to sail, we¦100144 left them and sailed directly across to Cos before going on to Rhodes the next day¦100149 and then on to Patara¦100158.
\v 2 From there we found¦100162 a ship¦100163 heading to Phoenicia, so we boarded¦100167 that and set off.
\v 3 After sighting Cyprus and then leaving it¦100176 behind on our left, we sailed on to Syria and docked there¦100186 at the port of Tyre¦100185 where the ship¦100190 had cargo¦100194 to be unloaded¦100192.
\v 4 We searched for the believers there¦100202 and then stayed on with them for seven¦100204 days¦100203. They were inspired by the \nd spirit¦100212\nd* to tell Paul¦100207 not to go to Yerusalem¦100219.
\v 5 Once our time was up there and everyone knew that we¦100229 were leaving, even the wives¦100234 and children¦100236 accompanied¦100230 us out of the city¦100240 to the port. We all knelt¦100242 on the beach and prayed¦100250
\v 6 before we continued on and boarded our ship¦100262 and they went¦100258 back to their¦100267 own homes¦100268.
\p
\v 7 So we sailed from Tyre¦100275 down to Ptolemais¦100279 where we were able to greet¦100282 the brothers¦100284 and sisters¦100284 and stay overnight with them.
\v 8 The next day¦100291 we continued on to Caesarea¦100303 and ended up in Philip's house¦100308. He was one of the \add original\add* seven¦100316 \add men who had been given the responsibility of distributing aid\add*—a preacher¦100311 of the good¦100311 message¦100311, and we stayed with him¦100319.
\v 9 Philip had four¦100326 unmarried daughters¦100324 still at home, and they shared messages from God.
\v 10 Several days¦100333 later a man named Agabus came¦100335 from Yudea. He too shared messages from God
\v 11 and when he arrived, he picked up Paul's belt and tied it around his own feet and hands, telling them that the holy \nd spirit¦100372\nd* had told him that this is how the owner of the belt would be treated by the Jewish leaders in Yerusalem¦100386 before they would then hand him over to the non-Jews¦100396 to be dealt with.
\p
\v 12 When we heard¦100399 this described, both we and the locals¦100407 begged Paul not to go to Yerusalem¦100416
\v 13 but he answered¦100418, “Oh come on, what's all this weeping¦100430 and carrying on that's breaking¦100433 my¦100434 heart¦100436. Actually I'm quite ready¦100449 not only to be tied up, but even to be killed in Yerusalem¦100448 as a testimony to the \nd master¦100457 Yeshua¦100458\nd*.”
\p
\v 14 When we saw that we couldn't change his mind, we didn't say anything else, figuring out that whatever the \nd master¦100470\nd* wills for the situation would happen,
\rem /s1 Paul Arrives at Jerusalem
\v 15 and so after¦100478 these¦100483 several days¦100482, we¦100489 had gotten everything ready and started off for Yerusalem¦100493.
\v 16 Some of the believers from Caesarea¦100501 accompanied us and led us to the home of a man named Mnason to stay—he was an older believer from Cyprus.

\p
\v 17 When we arrived at Yerusalem¦100519, the brothers¦100525 and¦100525 sisters¦100525 there happily welcomed¦100521 us,
\v 18 and the next day¦100526, we accompanied Paul¦100535 to go and see Yacob\f + \fr 21:18 \ft Yacob is commonly (but wrongly) called James in most older English Bibles.\f* and the elders¦100544 of the assembly there.
\v 19 After greeting¦100548 them, Paul then described all the things that \nd God¦100564\nd* had done among the non-Jews¦100567 as he had served among them,
\v 20 and when they'd heard¦100574 all that they praised¦100575 \nd God¦100578\nd* and told Paul, “Brother, you've noticed how many thousands¦100588 of Jews¦100593 have believed¦100597 \add in the messiah\add* but they still strive to observe¦100585 the \add Moses'\add* laws.
\v 21 But they've heard reports that you've been teaching¦100611 the Jews¦100620 that live outside our country that they don't have to obey what Moses \add wrote\add*—telling them that they don't have to have their¦100627 children¦100628 circumcised¦100625 and that they don't have to follow our \add Jewish\add* customs¦100633.
\v 22 What will happen \add now\add*, because \add the leaders here\add* will certainly hear¦100645 that you¦100648 have arrived?
\v 23 So here's what we¦100654 suggest that you¦100653 do: Four of our men are making a \add public\add* vow.
\v 24 Why don't you join these¦100664 four and join them in the purification¦100666 ceremony \add at the temple\add* and pay their expenses in getting your heads shaved. Then everyone will be able to see that it's false what they've heard about¦100690 you, because¦100672 you \add clearly\add* still comply with \add Moses'\add* instructions¦100689.
\v 25 And as for the believers¦100709 who are non-Jews¦100710, we've informed them of our recommendation that they should avoid anything that's been offered to an idol¦100734, avoid consuming blood¦100737 and meat from strangled¦100739 animals¦100739 and birds, and avoid sexual¦100741 immorality¦100741.”
\rem /s1 Paul Is Arrested
\p
\v 26 So the next day¦100751 Paul¦100744 took the \add four\add* men¦100747 for the purification¦100754 ceremony in the temple¦100759 and there they announced¦100760 the date when their vows would be fulfilled¦100762 and their sacrifices made.

\p
\v 27 When the seven¦100783 days¦100785 \add of the vow\add* were almost over, some Jews¦100794 from \add the province of\add* Asia \add Minor\add* noticed Paul in the temple¦100800. They stirred up the crowd¦100810 and grabbed hold of him,
\v 28 yelling out, “Men of Israel. Help us here. This is the man¦100830 who's been teaching¦100848 all around the world against Israel and against \add Moses'\add* law and against this temple. What's more he brought¦100853 non-Jews here into the temple and so has defiled¦100860 this holy place.”
\v 29 (\add They said this\add* because they had previously¦100868 seen¦100868 Trophimus from Ephesus¦100871 in the city¦100874 with Paul¦100886 and had assumed that he had brought¦100884 him into the temple¦100883.)
\p
\v 30 So now the whole¦100891 city¦100890 was in an uproar, and the crowds rushed in, grabbed Paul¦100900, and dragged¦100901 him¦100902 out of the temple and hurriedly closed the temple gates.
\v 31 They were ready to kill¦100918 Paul, but the commander¦100922 of the Roman soldiers had heard that all Yerusalem¦100929 was in an uproar.
\v 32 Taking some soldiers and officers, he immediately¦100931 ran down to the temple, and when the crowd saw the commander¦100945 and the soldiers they stopped beating Paul¦100953.
\v 33 The commander¦100958 came close and took¦100959 hold of Paul and ordered that he be tied up with a pair of chains¦100964 while he tried to find out who he was and what he'd done wrong.
\v 34 Various people in the crowd¦100985 were shouting out different things, and not being able to make any sense of it because¦100995 of all the commotion¦100997, the commander¦100998 ordered that Paul be taken into the barracks¦101003.
\v 35 When they got to the stairs¦101010, the soldiers¦101018 had to lift him¦101015 up above their heads because¦101019 of the frenzy of the crowd¦101024,
\v 36 because most of the people¦101030 were following¦101025 and shouting out, “Do away with him¦101035!”
\s1 Paul's defence

\rem /s1 Paul Speaks to the Crowd
\p
\v 37 As they were able to carry him into the fortress, Paul¦101043 called down to the commander, “Can I say¦101053 something¦101054 to you¦101056?”
\p “You speak Greek!”, replied the commander.
\v 38 “Aren't you¦101064 the Egyptian who stirred up a group of assassins¦101083 a while back and led them out into the wilderness¦101078?”
\p
\v 39 “No, I'm a Jew from Tarsus¦101095 in Cilica—a citizen¦101103 of an important city¦101102,” said¦101084 Paul¦101087. “But please, let me speak¦101111 to these people¦101114.”
\p
\v 40 The commander nodded, so the soldiers stood¦101124 Paul on the stairs¦101127 where he gestured¦101130 to the people¦101135. The crowd quietened down, and so Paul spoke loudly in his¦101116 Hebrew language¦101149:
\c 22
\nb
\v 1 “Men, brothers¦101152, and¦101153 fathers¦101154, listen to what I have to say for myself.”
\v 2 When they heard¦101163 him speaking Hebrew, they became even more quiet¦101174 as he continued,
\v 3 “I am a Jew who grew up in this very city¦101196 to study under Gamaliel¦101201. I've been raised according¦101205 to every part of our¦101207 ancestral¦101208 law, working hard to obey \nd God¦101213\nd* like all of you¦101217 here today¦101220.
\v 4 I used to persecute¦101226 the followers of ‘The Path’ even to death¦101229—tying up both men and women¦101239 and handing them over to the prisons¦101234
\v 5 as the Chief Priest and all the council¦101253 of elders¦101253 can tell \add you\add*. I took letters¦101257 from them to our \add Jewish\add* brothers¦101263 in Damascus¦101266 when I went so that I could arrest the ones there¦101272 and bring¦101268 them back here to Yerusalem¦101277 to be punished¦101280.

\v 6 “But one time as I was travelling and¦101286 getting close to Damascus¦101289 by the middle of the day, suddenly¦101294 a bright light¦101302 from the sky¦101298 began to flash¦101299 around me
\v 7 and¦101313 I fell to the ground¦101312. I heard¦101314 a voice¦101315 asking me, ‘Saul, Saul, why are you¦101324 persecuting¦101324 me?’
\v 8 ‘Who are you, master¦101332?’ I answered¦101327. And the voice said¦101333, ‘I am \nd Yeshua¦101342\nd*—the one from Nazareth¦101344 that you are persecuting¦101347.’
\v 9 The other¦101362 people with me saw¦101356 the light¦101355 but didn't hear the voice¦101363 that spoke to me.
\v 10 Then I asked, ‘What do I need to do, master?’ ‘Get up and continue into Damascus¦101384,’ the master said. ‘When you get there¦101385, you'll be told everything that you've been assigned to do.’
\v 11 But I couldn't see anything because¦101401 the brightness of the light¦101405 \add had affected my eyes\add*, so my companions had to lead me by hand¦101407 into Damascus¦101415.
\p
\v 12 “In Damascus there was a man¦101419 named Ananias¦101416—a \add non-Jew\add* but who was respected by the Jews¦101431 there because he strove to obey \add Moses'\add* instructions about living¦101430.
\v 13 Ananias came to where I was and standing by me said¦101438, “Brother Saul¦101440, receive¦101442 your sight¦101442?” That very hour¦101446 I was able to see again and look at him¦101450
\v 14 and he said¦101453, ‘The \nd god¦101455\nd* of our¦101458 ancestors¦101457 has decided in advance to reveal his¦101465 plans to you, and for you to see¦101467 the sinless one—to hear¦101471 him speaking
\v 15 because¦101480 he wants you to inform people¦101483 everywhere what you've seen¦101486 and heard¦101488.
\v 16 So what else are you waiting¦101492 for? Get up and wash away your¦101499 sins¦101498 by getting immersed¦101494 \add in water\add* as you request his¦101505 forgiveness.’

\p
\v 17 “Then when I returned¦101509 to Yerusalem¦101511 and¦101512 was praying¦101513 in the temple¦101517, I fell into a trance¦101521
\v 18 and saw \add the master\add* telling me, ‘Get out of Yerusalem¦101534 in a hurry because¦101535 they¦101537 won't accept¦101537 what you're teaching them about me.’
\v 19 ‘\nd Master¦101545\nd*,’ I replied, ‘they¦101546 know that previously I was the one imprisoning¦101551 and¦101552 beating¦101553 the people who believed¦101558 in you¦101560,
\v 20 and when Stephen was killed after teaching about you¦101570, it was me standing there and cheering on the ones executing him¦101587 as I held their coats for them.’
\v 21 Then \add the master\add* told me, ‘Get going¦101593 now because¦101594 I'm sending¦101600 you¦101602 away to the non-Jews¦101597.’ ”

\p
\v 22 Until this point in his message¦101610, the crowd had been listening to Paul, but now they started shouting, “Do away with this man¦101622! He doesn't deserve to live in this world!”
\v 23 Then they yelled and threw some of their¦101636 clothes¦101637 down onto the ground and threw dust up into the air.
\rem /s1 Paul Reveals His Roman Citizenship
\v 24 So the commander¦101648 ordered Paul to be brought¦101649 inside into barracks¦101654 and ordered that he be flogged¦101657 and interrogated¦101658 to determine what he'd done that would make the crowd react like that.
\v 25 But as they strapped¦101681 him down and stretched¦101676 him out for the flogging¦101700, Paul¦101689 asked the centurion¦101686 standing there, “It is legal for you to flog a Roman citizen who hasn't even been tried?”
\p
\v 26 When he heard¦101702 that, the centurion¦101705 went to the commander¦101714 and reported¦101716, “How are we going¦101721 to handle this, because this man¦101725 is a Roman citizen?”
\p
\v 27 So the commander¦101733 went in to where Paul was and asked him¦101736, “Tell me the truth. Are you¦101741 a Roman citizen?”
\p “Yes I am,” said¦101735 Paul.
\p
\v 28 “Yeah, and¦101753 I paid a lot for mine as well,” mocked the commander¦101756.
\p “Actually mine is through birth,” Paul¦101771 responded.
\p
\v 29 At this point, the soldiers who were about to interrogate¦101787 Paul left the room, and even the commander¦101790 was now afraid¦101792 after learning¦101793 that he had had a Roman citizen tied down to be flogged.

\p
\v 30 The next day¦101803, the Roman commander¦101823 still wanted to know¦101807 what was behind the anger of the Jews¦101816, so he had Paul released¦101817 from the cell, but brought¦101835 him down to a room where he had ordered the chief¦101827 priests¦101827 and the Jewish council¦101832 to convene. Paul was given a seat
\c 23
\nb
\v 1 and looking directly at the council¦101846 members said¦101849, “Men, brothers¦101851, all my life I have lived¦101856 before \nd God¦101858\nd* as a good¦101855 citizen¦101856 and with a clean conscience¦101854.”
\v 2 But Ananias¦101866 the chief¦101865 priest¦101865 commanded¦101868 one of his¦101873 companions to whack Paul on the mouth¦101875.
\v 3 “\nd God¦101889\nd* will strike¦101885 you,” said¦101884 Paul¦101878, “you grand show-off. You've been brought here to judge me as someone who knows the law and yet you violate¦101901 the law by commanding¦101902 that I be hit in the face.”
\p
\v 4 But the others standing there said¦101908, “Are you¦101914 insulting¦101914 God's chief¦101911 priest¦101911?”
\p
\v 5 “Brothers¦101921,” said Paul¦101918, “I didn't realise that he's the chief¦101924 priest¦101924, because¦101926 the scriptures teach us not to speak¦101933 wrongly¦101934 of our leaders.”
\p
\v 6 But then, knowing¦101935 that the council¦101953 consisted of some from the sect of the Sadducees¦101944 and some from the Pharisees' party, Paul¦101938 continued loudly, “Men, brothers¦101955, like my father, I'm a member¦101957 of the Pharisees and I'm being¦101968 tried today concerning¦101962 the hope and the resurrection¦101965 of the dead¦101966!”
\p
\v 7 Well, as soon as he said this, the council was split as the Pharisees and the Sadducees¦101985 started arguing.
\v 8 (Sadducees¦101991 say that the dead don't come back to life, and there's no messengers¦102000 and no spirits¦102002, but the Pharisees believe there is.)
\v 9 So then there was a big kerfuffle because some of the teachers¦102018 of the law spoke up for the Pharisees saying¦102027, “We don't see anything wrong with this man¦102033. Maybe it was a spirit¦102037 or one \add of God's\add* messengers¦102041 that spoke to him.”
\p
\v 10 But the \add Roman\add* commander¦102055 was afraid¦102052 that they might tear Paul apart¦102057 in the big argument, so he called for his soldiers to come¦102067 down to uplift Paul and return him to the barracks¦102079.
\p
\v 11 The following¦102082 night¦102083, the \nd master¦102087\nd* appeared to Paul and told him¦102085, “Be brave because¦102092 just like you testified¦102093 about me here in Yerusalem¦102099, so too you'll tell them about me in Rome.”

\p
\v 12 The next day¦102110, some of the Jews¦102120 gathered¦102114 informally and pledged not to eat¦102127 or drink¦102129 until¦102131 they'd killed Paul¦102139.
\v 13 There were more than forty¦102143 of them in this conspiracy¦102149,
\v 14 and they approached¦102153 the chief¦102155 priests¦102155 and elders¦102158 and told them, “We've¦102161 made an oath to taste¦102165 nothing¦102164 until¦102168 we've killed Paul¦102173, otherwise we'll bring a curse¦102161 on ourselves¦102163.
\v 15 So you guys assemble the council¦102190 and report¦102185 to the commander¦102187 so that he'll bring¦102194 him down to you all as if you need more information about his actions, and then we'll have an opportunity to kill¦102218 before¦102210 he gets here.
\p
\v 16 But a nephew of Paul had heard¦102224 about this ambush¦102233 and¦102236 went in to the barracks¦102241 to inform Paul.
\v 17 Paul¦102248 then called¦102245 one of the Roman centurions¦102251 and told him to take the young¦102255 man¦102255 to the commander¦102261 because¦102263 he had something¦102266 to tell him.
\v 18 So the centurion took him to the commander¦102276, explaining, “The prisoner¦102280 Paul¦102281, called¦102282 me and asked¦102284 me to bring this young¦102287 man¦102287 to you because he has something¦102293 to report to you.”
\p
\v 19 The commander¦102303 took the young man by the hand¦102300 and led him¦102301 into his¦102301 private office and asked, “What do you¦102313 have to tell me?”
\p
\v 20 “The Jews¦102320 have decided¦102321 to ask¦102323 you,”, he said¦102316, “that tomorrow¦102326 you bring¦102329 Paul¦102328 down to the council¦102332 as if they wanted to question him further.
\v 21 But don't¦102348 listen to them because¦102352 over forty¦102358 of their¦102354 men¦102356 will be lying¦102351 in wait for him, and they have sworn not to eat¦102363 or drink¦102365 until¦102367 they've killed him. In fact, they're all set up already, just waiting¦102377 for your consent.”
\p
\v 22 The commander¦102385 told the young¦102388 man¦102388 not to tell anyone else about the ambush and dismissed him.

\p
\v 23 Then the commander called¦102400 in two of his centurions¦102405 and ordered them to prepare two-hundred soldiers to travel as far as Caesarea¦102413, supported by seventy¦102416 mounted soldiers and two-hundred more with spears¦102418. They were to be ready to leave by 9pm,
\v 24 along with a horse for Paul¦102432 to ride, and were to get him¦102433 safely¦102433 to Governor Felix.
\v 25 Then the commander wrote a letter¦102457 ready to take:
\p
\v 26 “Greetings to the most excellent¦102470 Governor Felix from Claudius Lysias.
\v 27 I'm writing to you about this man¦102475 who had been captured¦102480 by the Jews¦102483 here and they were about to kill him when I moved in with my soldiers because he is a Roman citizen.
\v 28 I wanted to know¦102509 what they were accusing him of, so I took him down to their¦102523 council¦102522 meeting,
\v 29 but¦102535 I discovered that it was just some detail about their¦102533 \add Jewish\add* law and nothing¦102534 that should result in death¦102537 or imprisonment.
\v 30 Then when I learnt that they have a plot to try to ambush and kill him, I sent¦102558 him immediately¦102555 to you, and I'll order his accusers¦102564 to bring their case before¦102570 you.”
\p
\v 31 So the soldiers¦102576 carried out their instructions and took Paul¦102583 as far as Antipatris¦102590 during the night¦102587.
\v 32 The next morning the foot soldiers returned¦102602 to the barracks¦102605, leaving the mounted soldiers to take him¦102600 on
\v 33 to Caesarea¦102610, where they¦102617 presented¦102617 Paul¦102620 to the governor¦102616 along with the letter¦102614.
\v 34 After reading the letter the governor asked¦102627 Paul what province¦102631 that he's from and found out that he was from Cilicia.
\v 35 Then he ordered Paul to be kept under guard¦102662 \add in the prison\add* in Herod's¦102661 palace until he would hear¦102642 from him in the future once his accusers¦102648 got there.

\p
\v 1 Five days¦102668 later, Ananias¦102672 the chief¦102671 priest¦102671 arrived along with some elders¦102675 and¦102677 an attorney¦102678 named Tertullos¦102679, to bring the charges against¦102685 Paul¦102687 before Governor¦102684 \add Felix\add*.
\v 2 Once he was called¦102688 to speak, Tertullos¦102694 began¦102691 his¦102690 accusation¦102692 of Paul:
\p “We have seen peace¦102697 under your rule and the helpful reforms¦102702 that this nation¦102706 has experienced through your provision¦102711,
\v 3 most excellent¦102717 Felix¦102718, and we¦102716 gratefully welcome¦102716 everything you've done and everywhere you've done it¦102716.
\v 4 But in order¦102722 not to oblige you longer than necessary, in your gentleness¦102737 we request you to listen to our brief¦102734 statement.
\v 5 This man¦102741 here has been found¦102738 to be a troublemaker, stirring¦102746 up riots among the Jews¦102751 throughout the inhabited¦102755 world¦102755, and as a ring-leader of the Nazarite sect
\v 6 he even attempted¦102766 to profane¦102767 the temple¦102765 where we¦102770 were able to arrest him.
\v 7 ≈
\v 8 When you examine¦102802 him yourself¦102801 you'll discover all these¦102805 things that we're accusing¦102809 him of.”
\v 9 The Jews¦102816 who had come also affirmed all the accusations.
\s1 Paul's defence against the accusations
\rem /s1 Paul's Defense before Felix
\p
\v 10 So the governor¦102829 nodded¦102826 for Paul¦102825 to speak¦102830 and he started,
\p “I happily defend¦102846 myself¦102845 today knowing that you have many years¦102833 of experience ruling \add in this region\add*.
\v 11 You can quickly establish that it was less than twelve¦102858 days¦102856 ago that I arrived in Yerusalem¦102866 to worship there¦102854.
\v 12 They never found¦102873 me in the temple¦102872 arguing with anyone¦102876 or stirring up the crowd¦102882, and nor was I doing that in the Jewish¦102886 meeting¦102886 halls¦102886 or anywhere in the city¦102890
\v 13 and so they can't provide evidence to you¦102896 to support any of their accusations¦102902.
\v 14 However, I must confess¦102904 that I follow ‘The Path’ that they¦102913 call a sect which¦102912 serves the \nd God¦102919\nd* of our ancestors¦102918 and¦102926 believes¦102920 everything in \add Moses'\add* law as well as the writings of the prophets¦102930.
\v 15 We put our trust in the same God that they themselves¦102940 follow, and we all anticipate a resurrection¦102943 of those who serve God and those who don't.
\v 16 Because of this, I also strive to maintain a clean conscience¦102958 in everything¦102968, before \nd God¦102963\nd* and¦102964 the people¦102966.
\p
\v 17 After several years¦102970 away, I arrived¦102980 \add in Yerusalem\add* bringing offerings¦102982 to help my¦102979 own people and¦102981 before God.
\v 18 That was when they¦102986 found¦102986 me in the temple¦102991 after going through the purification¦102988 ceremony, and without either a crowd¦102994 or a commotion¦102997 around me.
\v 19 But there were some Jews¦103004 from Asia Minor who are the ones who should be appearing here before¦103008 you¦103009, and¦103011 they should be the ones accusing¦103012 me if they could find anything¦103014 against¦103016 me.
\v 20 Even these¦103022 ones here now should explain what their council¦103034 found¦103026 me guilty of,
\v 21 other than my calling out that I was being¦103052 judged¦103052 because I believe in the resurrection¦103049 of the dead¦103050.
\p
\v 22 But Felix who was already familiar with followers of ‘The Path’, announced that the trial would be adjourned until Commander Lysias arrived when he would investigate¦103079 further.
\v 23 He ordered the centurion¦103087 to keep Paul confined, but under relaxed¦103094 conditions and allowing any of his¦103100 friends to bring him anything he needed.
\s1 Paul speaks to the governor and his wife
\rem /s1 Paul Held in Custody
\rem /s1 Paul before Felix and Drusilla
\p
\v 24 However, several days¦103107 later Felix returned¦103110 there, \add this time\add* with his wife¦103117 Drusilla who was Jewish. He sent¦103122 for Paul¦103124 and¦103125 listened to him¦103127 explain about faith¦103134 in the \nd messiah¦103131\nd*.
\v 25 But when the subject turned to righteousness¦103139 and self-control¦103142 and the coming¦103148 judgement, Felix became very uncomfortable and told him, “That's enough for now. If I have time in the future, I'll send for you.”
\v 26 However he was also hoping¦103170 that Paul¦103177 would give him money¦103172, so he often sent for him and spoke with him.
\p
\v 27 This went on for two¦103189 years¦103189, until Felix was replaced as governor by Porcius Festus, but wanting¦103198 to stay in the good books of the Jews¦103204, Felix left Paul¦103210 confined.

\s1 Tried yet again, Paul appeals to Caesar
\rem /s1 Paul Appeals to the Emperor
\rem /s1 Paul Appears before Festus
\rem /s1 The Trial Before Festus
\p
\v 1 After Festus had been in the area for three¦103219 days¦103220, he made the uphill trip from Caesarea¦103225 to Yerusalem¦103223.
\v 2 There the chief¦103233 priests¦103233 and the Jewish leaders¦103236 repeated their case against¦103239 Paul¦103241, and they¦103243 implored¦103243 Festus,
\v 3 asking as a special favour¦103246, that he would order Paul to be sent to Yerusalem¦103255 (because¦103251 they wanted to ambush¦103256 and kill¦103258 him on the way¦103262).
\v 4 But Festus replied that he'd keep Paul¦103270 in Caesarea¦103273 and¦103276 he was heading back there soon,
\v 5 so he told them, “Some of your leaders can go there with me, and if the man¦103297 has done anything¦103292 wrong, they can explain their accusations¦103300 there.”
\p
\v 6 After staying seven or eight¦103311 days¦103306 in Yerusalem, Festus and company travelled back to Caesarea¦103316, and the next day¦103318 he sat¦103320 at the judge's bench and ordered that Paul¦103326 be brought¦103328 in.
\v 7 When he arrived¦103329, the Jews¦103338 who had come¦103337 from Yerusalem¦103336 stood¦103332 facing Paul and¦103340 presented many heavy¦103341 charges¦103342 which¦103349 they¦103351 weren't able to prove.
\v 8 Paul¦103355 defended¦103356 himself, stating that he had not sinned¦103373 against any Jewish law or against the temple¦103368, nor against any Roman law.
\p
\v 9 However, Festus wanted to be able to grant¦103384 a favour¦103382 to the Jews¦103380, so in response to Paul¦103387 he asked, “Are you willing¦103389 to be returned to Yerusalem¦103391 so that I can judge¦103397 you about these¦103395 things¦103395 there¦103393?”
\p
\v 10 “I'm here facing Caesar's representative,” Paul¦103403 replied. “and it's quite appropriate¦103413 for me to be judged¦103414 here. I've done nothing¦103416 wrong¦103418 to these Jews¦103415 as you¦103421 can no doubt see for yourself.
\v 11 If I had done anything wrong¦103429, anything worthy¦103431 of the death sentence, then I'm ready to accept death. On the other¦103440 hand, if none of their accusations¦103445 are true, no one can hand me over to them. I appeal to Caesar.”
\p
\v 12 So the Festus conferred with his legal counsel¦103462 and answered¦103463, “Well, you've appealed¦103465 to Caesar so you'll go to Caesar!”

\p
\v 13 Several days¦103469 later, King Agrippa¦103473 and¦103476 \add his sister\add* Bernice¦103477 arrived¦103478 in Caesarea¦103481 to meet Festus.
\v 14 As they¦103490 \add had planned to\add* stay¦103490 on for a few days¦103489, Festus mentioned about Paul¦103501 to the king¦103496, telling him, “There's¦103505 a prisoner¦103509 here that Felix left behind.
\v 15 When I was in Yerusalem¦103515, the chief¦103519 priests¦103519 and¦103520 Jewish elders¦103522 reported¦103516 to me, wanting a conviction¦103528 of this man.
\v 16 I told them that it's not the Roman way to convict someone until they've been able to face¦103550 their accusers and¦103556 make their defence¦103557 against the accusations.
\v 17 So as soon as they arrived here, on the very next day¦103571 I sat¦103573 on the judge's bench and ordered the man¦103580 to be brought¦103578 in
\v 18 that they were accusing¦103585, but they didn't raise even one of the charges¦103587 that I expected.
\v 19 Instead they¦103604 raised some issues about their¦103601 own beliefs and¦103608 about some dead person called \nd Yeshua¦103611\nd* that Paul¦103616 reckoned was still living¦103617.
\v 20 I was puzzled about this debate¦103626 and asked him if he wanted to be judged¦103636 about these things in Yerusalem¦103634.
\v 21 But Paul¦103641 appealed¦103642 to be kept safe from them until he could face the emperor, so I ordered him to be kept \add in prison\add* until I can send him to Rome.
\p
\v 22 “I'd quite like to hear him myself¦103669,” Agrippa¦103661 said.
\rem /s1 Paul Before Agrippa
\rem /s1 Paul Brought before Agrippa
\rem /s1 Paul Speaks to Agrippa
\p “Well, tomorrow,” replied Festus, “you'll be able to hear from him.”
\p
\v 23 So the next day¦103679, \add King\add* Agrippa¦103684 and Bernice¦103687 formally arrived with all their attendants and entered the auditorium¦103696 to greet the commanders¦103700 and the prominent¦103705 men¦103702 of the city¦103708, and then Festus ordered for Paul¦103715 to be brought¦103713 in.
\v 24 Festus started, “King Agrippa¦103720 and everyone present¦103725, observe¦103728 the prisoner who a multitude¦103735 of Jews¦103737 pleaded¦103738 with me about both in Yerusalem¦103743 and here, that he doesn't deserve to still be alive.
\v 25 But I haven't discovered anything that he's done that's worthy¦103759 of a death¦103761 sentence, and since he himself¦103765 appealed¦103770 to the emperor, I judged¦103773 that that's where he should be sent.
\v 26 The problem is that I don't¦103784 have any charge to write to my master¦103783 and so I've brought¦103788 the prisoner out in front of you so that after you examine¦103800 him, I might have something¦103804 I can write,
\v 27 because it¦103810 doesn't seem logical to me to transport a prisoner¦103812 \add to Rome\add* if there's no charges¦103818 specified against¦103816 him¦103817.
\c 26
\s1 Paul's defence before Festus and Agrippa
\rem /s1 Paul Defends Himself before Agrippa
\p
\v 1 So then Agrippa¦103820 told Paul, “Ok, you¦103827 can give your side now then.”
\m So Paul gestured with his hand¦103838 and began:
\p
\v 2 “Concerning¦103840 all the charges which¦103842 have been brought against me by the Jews¦103845, King Agrippa¦103847, I consider¦103848 myself¦103849 fortunate
\v 3 because you're an expert on Jewish customs¦103872 and issues, so I ask you to listen to me patiently¦103880.
\p
\v 4 “All the Jews¦103905 know about my early life, from my upbringing in my own country and¦103900 then in Yerusalem¦103901.
\v 5 They also know, and could even testify¦103911 to you if they¦103910 would admit it, that I followed our¦103918 religious¦103919 laws very closely as a member¦103921 of the Pharisees party¦103921.
\v 6 Yet now I stand judged¦103938 for believing in the same hope as our ancestors¦103930—that hope promised¦103932 by our \nd God¦103936\nd*
\v 7 who we twelve¦103942 tribes¦103942 diligently serve day¦103948 and¦103947 night¦103946 in order to obtain—the hope, oh king¦103963, for which I'm being¦103957 indicted¦103957.
\v 8 So why do you¦103968 all find it¦103966 unbelievable¦103965 that \nd God¦103971\nd* can raise the dead¦103972?
\p
\v 9 “I too \add originally\add* thought it¦103986 necessary¦103986 to do many things¦103988 to oppose the cause of this \nd Yeshua¦103983\nd* from Nazareth¦103985.
\v 10 So in Yerusalem¦103996 I worked to have many of these innocent believers locked¦104005 up in prison¦104004 with the authority¦104010 of the chief¦104009 priests¦104009, or if they were to be killed¦104012, I would add my vote against¦104015 them.
\v 11 And in all the Jewish¦104022 meeting¦104022 halls¦104022, \add when I found believers\add* I punished¦104024 them and forced them to curse \add God\add* and treated them with extreme anger, even travelling to further away towns.

\p
\v 12 So it was one time travelling to Damascus¦104045 carrying permission¦104049 letters from the chief¦104053 priests¦104053
\v 13 that in the middle¦104055 of the day¦104054, oh king¦104060, I saw¦104059 a bright light¦104070 from the sky—even brighter than the sun¦104067—and it shone¦104068 on me and my companions.
\v 14 All of us fell down to the ground¦104083 and I heard¦104084 a voice¦104085 speaking to me in Hebrew saying¦104086, “Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting¦104099 me? Life will be difficult for you if resist me.”
\v 15 “Who are you, master?” I asked.
\p And the master responded, “I am \nd Yeshua¦104118\nd*, the one you're¦104110 persecuting¦104121.
\v 16 Now get¦104125 up, because¦104132 I let you see me in order to appoint¦104135 you as my servant and my witness¦104140—to tell the people what you've seen and what you will be shown.
\v 17 I will rescue¦104149 you from your own people¦104153 and from the non-Jews¦104157 that I'm sending¦104163 you out to,
\v 18 to open their minds and for them to turn¦104172 back from darkness¦104174 to light¦104176 and from Satan's¦104182 power¦104180 to \nd God¦104185\nd*, so that they can be forgiven¦104189 for their sins¦104190 and receive¦104187 an inheritance among¦104193 the ones who've been made guiltless by their faith¦104196 in me.”

\p
\v 19 “So then, King Agrippa¦104202, I couldn't disobey that vision¦104208
\v 20 so I preached first¦104213 to those in Damascus¦104212 and then in Yerusalem¦104217 and all of Yudea, and then in the towns of the non-Jews¦104228. I preached about turning from their sins and turning back to \nd God¦104237\nd*, and then actually living like people who had repented¦104232.
\v 21 It was because of these¦104244 things¦104244 that the Jews¦104247 grabbed me in the temple¦104254 and tried to do me in.
\v 22 So it is that with God's help¦104257 until¦104265 this very day¦104267 I have stood¦104269 testifying¦104270 to commoners and leaders, teaching nothing¦104276 other than what Moses and the prophets¦104282 had already written that would happen—

\rem /s1 Paul Appeals to Agrippa to Believe
\p
\v 24 Then speaking about Paul's defence¦104310, Governor Festus said, “Paul, you're stark, raving¦104318 mad! All your education has turned you into an idiot.”
\p
\v 25 But Paul¦104330 said, “I haven't gone mad, most excellent¦104334 Festus, but¦104336 I'm speaking¦104341 the truth¦104337 in all seriousness.
\v 26 The king knows what I'm talking¦104352 about and that's why I'm speaking boldly¦104351, because none of these things were done in a corner¦104365 and I'm sure that none of it has escaped¦104353 his notice¦104353.
\v 27 King Agrippa¦104371, do you believe what the prophets¦104373 \add wrote\add*? Yes, I'm sure you do.
\p
\v 28 But Agrippa¦104379 answered Paul¦104382, “Do you think you can talk me into becoming a follower¦104389 of the messiah¦104389 in just that short time¦104385?”
\p
\v 29 “I hope to \nd God¦104400\nd*”, said Paul¦104394, “whether it takes a short time or a long time, that both you and the others listening today¦104417 will become¦104418 just like me except¦104425 for these¦104428 chains.”
\p
\v 30 Then the king¦104436 and the governor¦104439 both stood, along with Bernice¦104442 and the others sitting¦104445 with them
\v 31 and as they left they were saying¦104452 to each other, “That man¦104464 hasn't done anything deserving of death¦104456 or imprisonment.”
\p
\v 32 “Yes, he could have been set free,” replied Agrippa¦104466, “if he hadn't appealed¦104478 to Caesar.”

\s1 Paul is escorted off overseas
\rem /s1 Paul Sails for Rome
\rem /s1 Paul's journey to Rome
\p
\v 1 So when it¦104482 was considered the right season to sail to Italy, Paul¦104493 and¦104494 some other¦104496 prisoners¦104497 were put under the guard of a centurion¦104498 named Julius (from the Augustan¦104503 Regiment).
\v 2 We all boarded¦104504 on a ship¦104506 from Adramyttium¦104507 that was about to sail to various places¦104517 along¦104514 the coast of Asia \add Minor\add*. Aristarchus¦104522, a Macedonian man from Thessalonica¦104525, was with us as we¦104518 departed.
\p
\v 3 The next day¦104528 we¦104529 docked at Tsidon where Julius very kindly allowed Paul¦104538 to visit some of his friends¦104543 so they could provide for his needs.
\v 4 When we¦104550 left again, the ship stayed between Cyprus and the mainland because¦104553 of the unfavourable winds¦104556,
\v 5 then after sailing past Cilicia and¦104566 Pamphylia, we¦104569 docked at Myra in \add the province\add* of Lycia.
\v 6 There the centurion¦104581 found¦104579 a ship¦104583 from Alexandria¦104584 that was sailing¦104585 to Italy, so he boarded us on that.
\p
\v 7 After many days¦104597 of slow and difficult¦104600 sailing¦104598, we came alongside Cnidus but the wind¦104609 wasn't helpful to us, so we sailed¦104610 across to Crete and along the cape of Salmone.
\v 8 We sailed along¦104617 it¦104618 with difficulty¦104615 until we¦104619 came¦104619 to a place¦104621 called¦104623 ‘Fair Havens’ which¦104626 was near the city¦104629 of Lasea.
\p
\v 9 A lot of time¦104635 had now elapsed¦104636 and¦104637 the voyage¦104642 was starting to become dangerous¦104640 because¦104643 we were already heading into winter. Paul¦104652 advised¦104650 those in charge,
\v 10 telling them, “Men, I perceive¦104656 that we're going to encounter a lot of damage¦104659 on this voyage¦104680, with loss not only of the cargo¦104668 and the ship¦104671, but also our¦104676 lives¦104675.”
\v 11 But the centurion¦104683 was persuaded¦104692 by the ship¦104689 owner¦104689 and¦104687 the captain¦104686, rather¦104691 than by what Paul¦104697 had said.
\v 12 They realised that this harbour wasn't suitable to winter in, so the majority suggested leaving there¦104712 with the expectation of being¦104703 able to get to Crete to the winter in the harbour at Phoenix (which was open to both the southwest¦104727 and¦104728 the northwest¦104730).
\s1 The severe storm at sea
\rem /s1 The Storm
\rem /s1 The Storm at Sea
\p
\v 13 When a south¦104734 wind¦104734 started blowing gently¦104731, they thought they could make it, so they pulled in the anchor and sailed along¦104741 close to Crete.
\v 14 However¦104756, a short while later the wind¦104752 turned to a violent north-easter which¦104754 forced us out to sea.
\v 15 The ship¦104761 was driven by the wind¦104767 and unable to tack to face into it, so the sailors gave¦104768 up and just let it be driven.
\v 16 As we passed a small island¦104770 called¦104774 Clauda, we got a brief break and were able to resecure the lifeboat¦104784
\v 17 and then bring it up on board. Then ropes were used to wrap around the ship in case it were to run aground¦104799 into the shallows¦104797 at Syrtis and the gear was lowered¦104800,\f + \fr 27:17 \ft It's not certain what was meant here—it might have meant lowering the sails further to catch less wind or even lowering the mast, or else letting out the sea anchor to help keep the back of the ship facing the wind.\f* allowing the wind to drive¦104804 the ship along¦104804.
\v 18 We were violently¦104805 tossed¦104808 around by the storm¦104808, and the next day¦104810 the crew started \add lightening the ship by\add* tipping \add some of the cargo\add* overboard.
\v 19 By the third¦104816 day¦104816, the sailors themselves \add in desperation\add* were even throwing some of the ship's gear overboard.
\v 20 We didn't see either the sun¦104826 or the stars¦104828 for several more days¦104833—it wasn't a minor storm¦104834 by any means—and¦104835 by then any remaining hope that we had \add of staying alive\add* disappeared
\v 21 and no one had eaten or drunk much at all.
\p Then Paul¦104855 stood¦104853 up in the middle of them and said¦104859, “Well, you should have listened to me after all and not left Crete, so now we have this damage¦104874 and loss.
\v 22 Nevertheless I think we can all cheer¦104884 up because¦104886 not a single life¦104887 will be lost—only the ship¦104895—
\v 23 because last night¦104902 one of the messengers¦104913 of the \nd God¦104906\nd* that I serve came and stood¦104896 beside me
\v 24 and told me not to be afraid because I would indeed get to stand¦104921 before Caesar and that \nd God¦104927\nd* has granted¦104924 your lives to me as well.
\v 25 So cheer¦104934 up, fellows, because¦104937 I am certain that \nd God¦104939\nd* will carry out what was told to me
\v 26 even though we'll run¦104956 aground¦104956 onto an island¦104950 first.”
\rem /s1 The Shipwreck
\p
\v 27 So it happened that in the middle¦104969 of our fourteenth¦104959 night of being¦104963 blown across the Adriatic¦104967 Sea, the sailors¦104974 suspected¦104972 that we were nearing land.
\v 28 They dropped a weighted line and measured the ocean depth at around 40 metres and then a bit later it was down to 30 metres.
\v 29 Worrying that the ship might run¦105010 aground¦105010 on rough¦105007 \add rocks\add*, they threw out four¦105016 anchors¦105015 from the stern¦105013 as they hoped that daylight would come quickly.
\v 30 Then the sailors¦105023 lowered¦105031 the lifeboat¦105033 as if planning to pull out some anchors¦105043 from the bow, but really planning to desert the ship¦105029.
\v 31 However Paul¦105048 told the centurion¦105050 and¦105051 the soldiers¦105053 that if the sailors didn't remain¦105057 with the ship¦105060, everybody couldn't be sure to be saved¦105063,
\v 32 so the soldiers¦105069 cut the ropes¦105072 attaching the lifeboat¦105074 and¦105075 allowed¦105076 it to run¦105078 aground¦105078.
\p
\v 33 As they waited for the daylight, Paul¦105091 encouraged them all to eat something, saying¦105095, “Today¦105097 is our fourteenth¦105096 day and you've had nothing¦105102 to eat. As we're waiting¦105099,
\v 34 I urge you to eat something. This will help you to have strength because¦105116 none of you are going to drown.”
\v 35 Having said¦105133 that, he gave¦105139 thanks¦105139 to \nd God¦105142\nd* in front of everyone, and breaking some bread¦105138, started eating¦105148 it.
\v 36 They all cheered¦105149 up and also started eating.
\v 37 There were two¦105173 hundred¦105173 and seventy-six¦105174 of them on the ship¦105171
\v 38 and when they'd all eaten what they wanted, they lightened¦105181 the ship¦105183 more by throwing¦105184 their wheat¦105186 into the sea¦105189.
\s1 The ship runs aground
\rem /s1 The Shipwreck
\p
\v 39 Once it became¦105193 light, they saw that they were close to shore¦105204 in a bay but didn't recognise¦105198 the place. After some discussion, they decided to try to save the ship¦105217
\v 40 so they cut away the anchors¦105220 that were holding them in the sea¦105226 and untied the rudder¦105232 \add handles\add*. Then raising the foresail¦105236, they let the wind¦105237 blow them into the shore¦105242.
\v 41 But they hit a bank with ocean on both sides of it and the ship ran aground¦105248. The bow of the ship was completely stuck¦105257 but the stern¦105263 was being¦105264 broken up by the force¦105268 of the ocean.
\p
\v 42 At this point the soldiers¦105273 decided that they¦105279 should kill¦105279 the prisoners¦105278 in case any of them decided to swim away and escape¦105283,
\v 43 but the centurion¦105287 wanted to keep Paul¦105292 safe so he vetoed that plan. He commanded¦105299 those who could swim to jump off and swim in to shore,
\v 44 and for the others¦105322 to grab \add floating\add* planks¦105320 or something off the ship¦105328 \add that would float\add*, and so everyone got safely¦105333 onto the beach.

\p
\v 1 Once everyone was safe, we¦105341 discovered that the island¦105346 is called¦105347 Malta.
\v 2 And the people there showed incredible kindness¦105357 to us as they¦105364 welcomed us and lit a fire¦105362, as it started raining again and was very cold¦105375.
\v 3 However when Paul¦105379 was helping to pick up sticks¦105380 and putting them on the fire¦105390, a viper¦105391 was driven out by the heat and clamped¦105398 its jaws down on his¦105402 hand¦105401.
\v 4 When the islanders saw¦105405 the snake hanging from his hand¦105414 they decided that he must be a murderer¦105421 who had survived the shipwreck but now fate had finally decided his time was up.
\v 5 However, Paul just shook the snake off into the fire¦105445 and wasn't harmed.
\v 6 The locals were waiting¦105465 for his arm to swell¦105456 up or for him to fall down dead¦105460, but after a while when nothing¦105468 happened they changed¦105473 their¦105473 minds¦105473 and decided that instead, he must be a god¦105481.
\p
\v 7 The area that we had beached in belonged to the leader¦105492 of the island¦105494 named Publius. He welcomed us and looked after us for three¦105500 days¦105501,
\v 8 but while we were there, his father¦105508 got sick with dysentery¦105513 and fever¦105511. Paul¦105520 went in and placing his hands¦105527 on him, prayed¦105523 for him and healed¦105529 him.
\v 9 As a result of that, anyone on the whole island¦105543 who was sick came and was cured
\v 10 and so the people brought us many gifts and when we left, they supplied us with provisions.

\v 12 We stayed three¦105588 days¦105586 when we¦105585 arrived at Syracuse

\p
\v 17 After three¦105688 days¦105687, he called together the leaders¦105697 of the Jews¦105696 \add in Rome\add*, and when they'd all gathered he spoke to them, “Men, brothers¦105707, I have done nothing¦105709 against my people¦105713 or against our ancestral¦105718 customs¦105716. I was taken prisoner¦105719 in Yerusalem¦105721 and handed over to the Romans
\v 18 who, after examining¦105729 me, wanted to release me because¦105735 I had done nothing worthy of execution.
\v 19 But in defending myself against the Jews there, I felt compelled¦105747 to appeal¦105748 to Caesar, although I myself had no complaint against the Jews.
\v 20 So that was why I called for you and wanted to address¦105770 you, because¦105773 I am in chains¦105780 for the sake of Israel's hope—\add the messiah\add*.”
\p
\v 21 “We haven't received¦105796 any correspondence here about you,” they answered. “Nor have any of our brothers¦105804 \add from Yerusalem\add* arrived¦105801 here to report¦105805 any crimes of yours.
\v 22 But we would very much like to hear¦105817 from you about your thinking¦105819, because we've certainly heard about this new sect because everyone¦105831 is speaking out against¦105832 it.”
\rem /s1 Paul Preaches in Rome
\p
\v 23 Then they set a day¦105836 when they could visit him where he was staying and so that from morning¦105872 to evening¦105874 he could explain¦105847 about God's kingdom¦105853 and show them how Moses' law and the prophets' writings spoke about \nd Yeshua¦105862\nd*.
\v 24 Afterwards some were persuaded¦105879 while others¦105883 didn't find it believable.
\v 25 They argued back and forth, and as they¦105891 were about to leave, Paul¦105894 shared this final¦105896 message¦105895, “The holy \nd spirit¦105900\nd* spoke¦105903 rightly through Isayah the prophet¦105908 to your¦105912 ancestors¦105911, saying:
\q1
\v 26 Go to these people¦105923 and tell them,
\q1 When you listen you will hear¦105928 but not understand¦105934,
\q1 and when you look you will see but not perceive¦105942 it.
\q1
\v 27 Because¦105945 these people's¦105949 minds have become¦105944 dull
\q2 and they can barely hear with their ears
\q2 and they shut their eyes,
\q1 just in case their eyes might actually see,
\q2 and their ears might actually hear,
