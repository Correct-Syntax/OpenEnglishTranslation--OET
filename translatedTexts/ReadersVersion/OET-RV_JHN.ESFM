\s1 The coming of the true light
\p
\v 1 In the beginning was the Messenger, and the Messenger was with God, and the Messenger was God.
\v 2 The Messenger was with God right in the beginning.
\v 3 Everything came into existence through the Messenger\f + \fr 1:3 \ft Lit. Him.\f*—not even one thing came into existence apart from Him.
\v 4 He holds Life, and that Life is the Light of humankind.
\v 5 And that Light is shining in the darkness, and darkness cannot overcome Him.
\p
\v 6 \x + \xo 1:6: \xt Mat 3:1; Mrk 1:4; Luk 3:1-2.\x*A man arrived who had been sent by God. His name was John.
\v 7 He came as a testimony to tell about the Light so that everyone would believe the Light.
\v 8 John himself wasn’t the Light—he was merely the announcer of the Light.
\v 9 The true Light which enlightens every person was coming into the world.
\p
\v 10 He was in the world and He was the creator of the world, and yet the world didn’t even know Him.
\v 11 He came to His own chosen people, but they wouldn’t accept Him.
\v 12 But whoever would accept Him, whoever trusted in His authority, He gave them the right to become children of God.
\v 13 Not physical children and not coming from human actions, but children of God.
\p
\v 14 And the Messenger became a human and lived here among us and we saw his greatness—the greatness of an only child of the Father—full of grace and truth.
\p
\v 15 John explained about him and loudly told everyone, “This is the one I meant when I said, ‘There’s someone coming after me, yet who came before me, because he existed before I did!’ ”
\p
\v 16 Because He has so much, we all received grace and then even more grace.
\v 17 The commandments came to us through Moses, but grace and truth came to us through Jesus the Messiah.
\v 18 No one has ever actually seen God, but the human son born from God the father, He was the one to explain God to us.
\s1 The interrogation of John the Immerser
\r (Mat. 3:1-12; Mar. 1:1-8; Luk. 3:1-18)
\p
\v 19 John explained some of this when the Jewish leaders sent out priests and temple workers from Jerusalem to ask him, “Who are you?”
\p
\v 20 And he didn’t flinch from the truth and told them, “I am not the chosem Messiah.”
\p
\v 21 \x + \xo 1:21: a \xt Mal 4:5; \xo b \xt Deu 18:15,18.\x*So they asked him again, “Are you Elijah come back to life?”
\p And he answered, “No, I’m not.”
\p They asked, “Are you the prophet?”
\p Again he answered, “No, I’m not.”
\p
\v 22 So they asked him, “Who are you then? We need to give an answer to the ones who sent us. How do you describe yourself?”
\p
\v 23 \x + \xo 1:23: \xt Isa 40:3 (LXX).\x*So he said, “I am a voice shouting in the wilderness smooth the path of the master, as the prophet Isaiah said.”
\p
\v 24 Some of the ones sent out were members of the Pharisee sect.
\v 25 These ones asked John, “So why are you immersing people then if you aren’t the Messiah or Elijah or the prophet?”
\p
\v 26 He answered, “I’m immersing people in water, but someone here among us all there’s someone you don’t know—
\v 27 the one coming after me and I’m not even good enough to untie his sandal straps!”
\p
\v 28 All this happened in Bethania, on the east side of the Jordan River where John was immersing people.
\s1 Jesus gets publicly revealed
\p
\v 29 The next day John saw Jesus coming towards him, and said, “Hey! Here’s the sacrificial lamb of God who’s come to take away the sin of the world.
\v 30 This is the man I was talking about when I said, ‘There’s someone coming after me, yet who came before me, because he existed before I did.’
\v 31 I didn’t know who he was but nevertheless I came and immersed people in water so that this man could be revealed to the country.”
\p
\v 32 And John further explained, “I saw God’s spirit come down and settle on Him.
\v 33 I didn’t know which one was Him, but the one who sent me to immerse people in water said, ‘When you see the spirit coming down and settling on someone, He is the one who will immerse people with God’s holy spirit.’
\v 34 And I have seen that, and so I can assure you that He is God’s son.”
\s1 Jesus gets a few followers
\p
\v 35 The next day, John was back there with two of his apprentices
\v 36 and noticing Jesus walking nearby he said, “Look! There’s the sacrificial lamb of God.”
\p
\v 37 When his two apprentices heard him say that, they left him and followed Jesus.
\v 38 But Jesus turned and saw them following him, and asked them, “What are you two wanting?”
\p And they said to him, “Teacher, where do you stay?”
\p
\v 39 Jesus replied, “Come and see.” So they went with Him and saw where he lived, and they stayed there that night, because it was already after 4pm.
\p
\v 40 Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter was one of those two who heard John and then followed Jesus.
\v 41 As soon as he found his brother, he said to Simon, “We have found the Messiah—God’s chosen one,”
\v 42 and led him to Jesus. When Jesus saw him, he said, “Ah, you are Simon John but from now on you’ll be called Simon Peter which means /it stone/it*.”
\s1 Philip and Nathanael join the group
\p
\v 43 The following day, Jesus wanted to go to Galilee. He found Philip and told him, “Follow me!”
\v 44 Philip was from the town of Bethsaida where Andrew and Peter lived.
\v 45 Philip then found Nathanael and told him, “We’ve found the one that Moses and the prophets wrote about in the Scriptures. He’s Jesus from Nazareth.”
\p
\v 46 And Nathanael said, “Does anything good come from Nazareth?”
\p So Philip answered, “Well, come and see.”
\p
\v 47 Jesus saw Nathanael approaching and said, “Ah, this is an honest Israeli.”
\p
\v 48 But Nathanael queried him, “Where do you know me from?”
\p And Jesus replied, “Actually I saw you under that fig tree before Philip had even called you.”
\p
\v 49 Nathanael exclaimed, “Great teacher! You \em are\em* God’s son! You’re the king of Israel!”
\p
\v 50 Jesus responded, “So you believe this because I said that I had seen you under the fig tree. You’ll get to see much greater things than that!” 
\v 51 \x + \xo 1:51: \xt Gen 28:12.\x*And he continued, “Honestly, I’m telling all of you:  you’ll be seeing the sky opened up and God’s messengers going and and coming down on me, the Son of Man.”
\c 2
\s1 The wine miracle
\p
\v 1 On the Tuesday, there was a wedding in Cana in Galilee, and Jesus’ mother was there.
\v 2 Jesus and his apprentices were also invited.
\v 3 When the wine ran out at the wedding, Jesus’ mother said to Him, “They haven’t got any more wine.”
\p
\v 4 Jesus answered, “What does that have to do with us, mother? It’s not yet the time for my ministry.”
\p
\v 5 But his mother told the servants, “Do whatever he tells you.”
\p
\v 6 Now there were six empty stone water jars there that are used for Jewish purification ceremonies. (Each one could hold over 70 litres.)
\v 7 So Jesus told them to fill the jars with water, and they filled them up.
\v 8 Then he said, “Ok, now take a sample out and give it to the MC.” So they took some.
\v 9 And when the MC tasted the water that had now turned to wine (but he didn’t know where it had come from), he called the groom
\v 10 and exclaimed, “Most people supply the best wine at the beginning, and the cheaper stuff when people are a bit tipsy. But you’ve kept the best wine until last!”
\p
\v 11 This in Cana, Galilee, was the first of the miracles that Jesus did and it revealed his greatness, and his followers believed that he was from God.
\p
\v 12 \x + \xo 2:12: \xt Mat 4:13.\x*After that, Jesus and his mother and brothers and his followers travelled east to Capernaum, but they only stayed there a few days.
\s1 Jesus disturbs the temple traders
\r (Mat. 21:12-13; Mar. 11:15-17; Luk. 19:45-46)
\p
\v 13 \x + \xo 2:13: \xt Exo 12:1-27.\x*It was getting close to the time of the Jewish Feast of the PassOver, and Jesus went down to Jerusalem.
\v 14 There in the temple, he discovered merchants selling cows and sheep and doves, and moneychangers sitting at their tables.
\v 15 Jesus formed some cords into a whip and drove the sheep and cows out of the temple grounds, and he overturned the tables—spilling the coins of the moneychangers onto the ground.
\v 16 He scolded the ones selling doves, saying, “Get them out of here. Don’t be making my father’s house into a market.”
\v 17 \x + \xo 2:17: \xt Psa 69:9.\x*That reminded his followers of the scripture: “I’ll be filled with zeal for your temple.”
\p
\v 18 Then the Jewish leaders responded, “Do a miracle to show that you have the authority to do these things.”
\p
\v 19 \x + \xo 2:19: \xt Mat 26:61; 27:40; Mrk 14:58; 15:29.\x*But Jesus answered, “Well, destroy this temple and I’ll raise\f + \fo: 2:19 \ft We couldn’t easily use \em rebuild\em* here because there’s a play on words—see verse 21.\f* it again in three days.”
\p
\v 20 The leaders smirked, “This temple took 46-years to build, and you’ll raise it again in three days?”
\p
\v 21 But Jesus had been meaning his own body when he was talking about the temple.
\v 22 In the future when he was actually raised from the dead, his followers remembered this statement, and they believed both the Hebrew scriptures and Jesus’ message.
\s1 Jesus’ superpowers
\p
\v 23 And when Jesus was at the Passover Feast in Jerusalem, many believed in his authority because they saw the miracles that he was able to do.
\v 24 But Jesus himself never fully entrusted himself to them, because he knew what humankind is like.
\v 25 (He didn’t need anyone to tell him what humankind is like because he could see what any person was like on the inside.)
\c 3
\s1 The pegpahuhurey of Jesus and Nikudimu
\p
\v 1 One night a Jewish leader named Nicodemus who was a member of the sect of the Pharisees
\v 2 came to Jesus and said,  “Teacher, we know that God has sent you as a teacher, because no one could do these kinds of miracles if God wasn’t with him.”
\p
\v 3 Jesus responded,  “I’ll tell you frankly that no one can enter God’s kingdom unless he is <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">reincarnated</span> reborn.”
\p
\v 4 Nicodemus questioned,  “How could an old person be reborn? He can’t just return to his mother’s womb and then be born again!”
\p
\v 5 And Jesus continued,  “Honestly, I’m telling you: unless a person is born from both water and the spirit, they can’t enter God’s kingdom.
\v 6 Someone that’s born from a body is flesh, but someone that’s born from God’s spirit is spiritual.
\v 7 You shouldn’t be surprised that I told you that everyone needs to be reborn.
\v 8 The wind blows wherever it wants, and you hear its sound but you can’t actually see where it’s coming from and where it’s going. So too with everyone born from God’s spirit.”
\p
\v 9 Nicodemus replied,  “How could all this happen?”
\p
\v 10 And Jesus answered,  “You’re a Jewish teacher and yet you don’t know all this?
\v 11 It’s true that we just teach what we know, and explain what we’ve seen ourselves, but you people aren’t accepting our testimony.
\v 12 If I tell you all earthly things and you don’t believe them, how will you ever believe if I explainly heavenly things?
\v 13 None of you have gone up into heaven, except that I, the Son of Man, have come down from heaven.
\p
\v 14 \x + \xo 3:14: \xt Num 21:9.\x*“Just like Moses lifted up that \add bronze\add* snake \add on a pole\add* in the wilderness, it’s necessary for the Son of Man to be lifted up,\f + \fo: 3:14 \ft lifted up / exalted: See https://bibleDifferences.net/2019/04/25/156-exulted\f*
\v 15 so that everyone who believes in Him won’t die, but will live forever.\f + \fo: 3:15 \ft See http://bibleandtech.blogspot.com/2021/03/john-314-21-translation-and-commentary.html\f*
\p
\v 16 “Because in the same way, God loves the people of the world enough to cause his only son to be born and to give him to the world, so that everyone who believes that will not die, but will live forever.
\v 17 God didn’t send his son here to condemn poeple, but rather to save them.
\v 18 The one who trusts in me will not be condemned. However, the one who doesn’t believe this has already been condemned because he rejected the authority of the only son that God has given birth to.
\v 19 And this is the verdict: that light has come into the word, but some people loved the darkness more than the light because they do evil things.
\v 20 Because everyone who does evil things hates the light, and doesn’t come to the light so that their actions won’t be exposed.
\v 21 but whoever does what is right and true comes toward the light so that their actions can be revealed as being done with God’s help.”
\s1 John approves of Jesus’ popularity
\p
\v 22 After this, Jesus and his followers went down to Judea, and stayed there and immersed some believers.
\v 23 John was also immersing people at Aenon near Salim because there was plenty of water there and people would come to get immersed.
\v 24 \x + \xo 3:24: \xt Mat 14:3; Mrk 6:17; Luk 3:19-20.\x*(At this time, John had not yet been put in prison.)
\v 25 Then a debate started about purification between John’s followers and a Jewish leader.\f + \fo: 3:25 \ft https://www.billmounce.com/monday-with-mounce/what-does-the-word-%E2%80%9Cjew%E2%80%9D-mean-you-john-3-25\f*
\v 26 So they came to John and said,  “Teacher, that man that came to you across the river and that you testified about, he’s now immersing people and so they’re all going to him.”
\p
\v 27 John answered, “None of us get anything if it’s not being given from heaven.
\v 28 \x + \xo 3:28: \xt Jn 1:20.\x*You yourselves realised that I said that I’m not the Messiah, but rather the one coming before him.
\v 29 It’s the groom that has the bride—the best man  is happy because he sees that the groom is happy. So I’m actually completely happy with all this.
\v 30 It’s right that he should increase and I should fade out.”
\p
\v 31 “The one who came down from heaven is greater than any of us. We came from this world and speak in our worldly ways. The one who came down from heaven is greater than any of us.
\v 32 He explains about what he’s seen and heard, but people don’t believe him.
\v 33 Whoever does believe him, confirms that God is true.
\v 34 The one that God sent tells us God’s words, because God doesn’t ration his spirit.
\v 35 \x + \xo 3:35: \xt Mat 11:27; Luk 10:22.\x*The Father loves the Son and has put him in charge of everything.
\v 36 Whoever believes the Son will live forever, but whoever disobeys the Son won’t be seeing life, but will feel God’s severe anger.”
\c 4
\s1 Jesus chats with a woman at the well
\p
\v 1 When Jesus found out that the Pharisees knew that he was gaining and immersing more followers than John had,
\v 2 (although actually it wasn’t Jesus himself that was immersing them, but his disciples were doing it),
\v 3 he left Judea and went back up to Galilee.
\v 4 On the way, he decided to go through Samaria.
\p
\v 5 \x + \xo 4:5: \xt Gen 33:19; Josh 24:32.\x*Because of that, they came to a town in Samaria called Sukar, which was near the place Joseph had inherited from his father Jacob,
\v 6 and Jacob’s well was there. Jesus was tired from all the walking and was sitting at the well around noon.
\p
\v 7 A woman came from the town to get water from the well, and Jesus asked her for a drink
\v 8 since his followers had gone into the town to buy some lunch.
\p
\v 9 \x + \xo 4:9: \xt Ist 4:1-5; Neh 4:1-2.\x*The woman said to him, “You’re a Jew. How come you’re asking me for a drink when I’m from Samaria?” (Jews don’t normally associate with anyone from Samaria.)
\p
\v 10 Jesus answered, “If you had recognised God’s gift and who it is who’s asking you for a drink, you would have asked me and I would have given you \em living\em* water.”
\p
\v 11 But the woman countered, “Sir, you don’t even have \add rope and\add* a bucket to reach the water in the deep well. How then could you get living water?”
\v 12 I doubt that you’re greater than our ancestor Jacob who made this well for us, and drank this water along with his children and his animals.”
\p
\v 13 Jesus responded, “Everyone who drinks this water will get thirsty again,
\v 14 but whoever drinks the water that I give them will find a well springing up inside them—springing into eternal life.”
\p
\v 15 The woman said, “Ok. Give me some of that water so that I won’t be thirsty and won’t have to keep coming out here to the well.”
\p
\v 16 Jesus said, “First go and get your husband and return here.”
\p
\v 17 But she retorted, “I don’t have a husband!”
\p And Jesus said, “True enough—indeed you don’t.
\v 18 You’ve had five husbands and you’re not married to the <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">guy</span> man you’re living with, so that was true.”
\p
\v 19 The woman reacted, “Sir, I can tell that you’re a prophet.
\v 20 Our ancestors worshipped on this mountain, but you Jews claim that people should only worship there in Jerusalem.”
\p
\v 21 Then Jesus told her, “You need to believe that I’m from God, woman, because a day is coming when everyone will be worshipping him neither on this mountain, nor in Jerusalem.
\v 22 You people in Samaria don’t even know who you worship, but we do because people will be saved by means of the Jews.
\v 23 But a time is coming, starting even now, when the true worshippers will be worshipping the father in spirit and truth, because those are the ones that he is wanting to worship him.
\v 24 God is spirit, and the ones worshipping him must worship in spirit and totally honesty.”
\p
\v 25 The woman said, “I’m aware that the Messiah is coming—the chosen one of God. Whenever he appears, he’ll teach us everything.”
\p
\v 26 And Jesus responded, “I am the Messiah. Yes, he’s speaking to you!”
\p
\v 27 After this, his followers got back, and they were astounded that he was speaking with a woman. However no one dared ask her, “What are you after?” Or ask him, “Why are you talking with her?”
\p
\v 28 So the woman left her water jar there, and went back into the town. She told the people there,
\v 29 “Come and see a man who knew as much about me as I know myself! He must be the Messiah!”
\v 30 So they left the town and went out to see Jesus.
\p
\v 31 Meanwhile, Jesus’ followers encouraged him, “Teacher, here, eat.”
\p
\v 32 But he said, “I’ve had food to eat that you don’t know about.”
\p
\v 33 This made his followers ask each other, “Did you see anyone bring him something to eat?”
\p
\v 34 And Jesus explained, “Obeying God who sent me is like food to me, and I plan to finish his work.”
\v 35 Don’t you all have a saying about needing to wait four months for a harvest? But I’m telling you that you all should open your eyes and look at the fields, because they’re already colouring with the coming harvest.
\v 36 The harvester gets paid with a harvest that will last forever so that the ones who plant and the ones who harvest can all celebrate.
\v 37 There’s truth in the statement that one person plants and a different person harvests.
\v 38 I’ve sent you all out to harvest where you haven’t worked before—others did the groundwork and you benefit from their work.
\p
\v 39 And many people of Samaria came out of that town and believed that Jesus is God because the woman had told them that he knew everything she had done.
\v 40 So when they all came, they asked him to stay in their town, and so they stayed there for two days.
\p
\v 41 And many more believed as a result of his teaching,
\v 42 so they told the woman, “We no longer believe just because of what you said, but now that we’ve heard him for ourselves, we can see that he really is the saviour of the world.”
\s1 Jesus heals the official’s son
\p
\v 43 After his two days in Samaria, Jesus continued up to Galilee.
\v 44 \x + \xo 4:44: \xt Mat 13:57; Mrk 6:4; Luk 4:24.\x*He himself said that no prophet gets honoured in his own home town.
\v 45 \x + \xo 4:45: \xt Jn 2:23.\x* When he got to Galilee, the people accepted him, having seen everything that he’d done at the feast in Jerusalem because they had also been there.
\p
\v 46 \x + \xo 4:46: \xt Jn 2:1-11.\x*So he went again to Cana there in Galilee where he had made the water into wine. And there was a royal official there, whose son in Capernaum was ill.
\v 47 When the official heard that Jesus was coming up from Judea to Galilee, he went and asked him if he would come and heal his son who was dying.
\v 48 Jesus said to him, “You people won’t believe unless you see miracles and other marvels.”
\p
\v 49 But the official begged him, “Sir, please come before my child dies.”
\p
\v 50 Jesus responded, “Go there and see. Your son will recover.”
\p The man believed what Jesus had told him, and so he started off.
\v 51 On his way, his slaves met him and reported that the boy was alive and well.
\p
\v 52 So the official inquired what time it was that he got better and they replied that the fever had subsided around 1pm.
\v 53 The father knew that that was the time when Jesus had told him that his son would recover, and as a result, his whole household believed.
\p
\v 54 This was the second miracle that Jesus did after leaving Judea and going to Galilee.
\c 5
\s1 Jesus heals a man at the pool
\p
\v 1 After all this, there was another Jewish feast, so Jesus went down to Jerusalem.
\v 2 In Jerusalem at the Sheep Gate, there’s the Bethsaida pool that has five alcoves
\v 3 and a large number of sick, blind, lame, and paralysed people lie there in them.
\v 4
\v 5 One man had been there for thirty-eight years,
\v 6 and when Jesus noticed him and knew that he’d been there for so long, he asked, “Do you want to get better?”
\p
\v 7 The sick man answered, “Yes sir, but when the water starts moving, I don’t have a companion to lift me into the pool, so someone else always get there before me.”
\p
\v 8 Then Jesus said, “Stand up and pick up your things and start walking.”
\v 9 The man immediately stood up, picked up his gear, and started to walk.
\p However, this was the weekly rest day.
\v 10 \x + \xo 5:10: \xt Neh 13:19; Jer 17:21.\x*So the religious leaders said to the man, “Hey! It’s against the law for you to carry your bedding on the rest day!”
\p
\v 11 But the man answered, “The person who made me better told me to pick up my things and start walking.”
\p
\v 12 “Oh. Who was it that told you to take that stuff and start walking?”
\p
\v 13 But the man who had been healed didn’t even know who it was, because when a crowd had formed, Jesus had quickly left.
\p
\v 14 Later on, Jesus found the man in the temple and told him, “Look, you’re better now. So don’t sin because you don’t want anything worse to happen to you.”
\p
\v 15 The man then went and told the leaders that it was Jesus who had made him better.
\v 16 As a result, the leaders started harassing Jesus because he had done this on a rest day.
\v 17 But Jesus just replied, “My father is working today, and so I am also working.”
\p
\v 18 Because of this, the leaders became determined that he must be put to death, not just because he broke the rules for the rest day, but especially because he was calling God his own father, thus making himself equal to God!
\s1 Authority over life is given to the Son
\p
\v 19 So Jesus responded to them, “I want to tell you all something: The son can’t initiate anything by himself. He can only do what he sees his father doing, because whatever his father is doing, he also does things like that.
\v 20 You see, the father loves his son and shows him everything that he’s doing. In fact, he’ll be showing him even greater things than what he’s done already, so that you all will be amazed.
\v 21 Because the father brings the dead back to life, giving them new life, so also the son can give life to whoever he wants.
\v 22 The father won’t be judging anyone, but has already given that task to the son,
\v 23 so that the people might honour the son like they honour the father. But any who is not honouring the son, is also dishonouring the father who sent him.
\p
\v 24 “I assure you that whoever hears my message and believes that I was sent by God, will live forever and will not be condemned, but has moved from death into life.
\v 25 I can also assure you that a time is coming, and in fact is here already,  when the dead will be hearing the voice of the son of God and that voice will bring them back to life.
\v 26 As the the father is the source of life, he gave the power of giving life to the son
\v 27 and gave him the authority to be the final judge, because he is the Son of Man.
\v 28 Don’t be surprised at this, because a time is coming when everyone in their graves will be hearing his voice,
\v 29 \x + \xo 5:29: \xt Dan 12:2.\x*and the ones having done what is good will be given new life, and the ones having done what is evil will be condemned.
\s1 The migpamalehet meyitenged ki Jesus
\p
\v 30 Jesus continued explaining to the religious leaders, “I don’t do anything by myself. As I hear from him, only then do I judge and my judgement is correct and impartial because I’m not imposing my desires, but the desire of the one who sent me.
\p
\v 31 “If I just testify about myself, my testimony would not be correct or even valid.
\v 32 But it’s another one that’s testifying about me, and I know that his testimony about me is true.
\v 33 \x + \xo 5:33: \xt Jn 1:19-27; 3:27-30.\x*You sent people out to question John and his testimony was true.
\v 34 But I don’t even need testimony that comes from people, because I am teaching you how to be saved.
\v 35 John was a bright and shining light and you appreciated it for a short time.
\v 36 But I have a stronger testimony that John’s because the father has entrusted works to me to complete, and which I’m already doing and which clearly show that the father sent me here.
\v 37 \x + \xo 5:37: \xt Mat 3:17; Mrk 1:11; Luk 3:22.\x*And since he sent me, he himself has testified about me. You people have never listened to his voice, nor have you ever seen him!
\v 38 And his way of thinking is obviously not in your minds, because you don’t believe the one that he sent.
\v 39 You look in the Jewish scriptures because you suppose that they’ll lead you to eternal life. Those very scriptures testify about me coming,
\v 40 yet you refuse to come to me in order to receive life.
