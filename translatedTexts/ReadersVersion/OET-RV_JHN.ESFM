\mt2 The account of Jesus' ministry by
\mt1 John
\is1 Introduction
\is2 Author
\ip This account about the works and teachings of Jesus was written by John, brother of Jacob (mistakenly known in English as James)—both of them were in the small group of twelve close followers of Jesus that he selected as His apprentices and who accompanied him around as he taught. Out of them, John was the one that greatly loved Jesus, and his closeness gave him much of the insight that he includes with his description of Jesus' actions and teaching. The two brothers were the sons of Zebedee, and they had all worked on Lake Galilee as fishermen.
\is2 This account
\ip We place John's account before the others because it begins with the eternal existence of Jesus the messiah. Not only is Jesus the godly messenger, he was also the creator who has now descended from heaven as a man. Omitting any mention of the baby Jesus, John does however tell us about John-the-Immerser who came before Jesus to prepare the people for the arrival of the promised messiah.
\ip In chapters two to twelve it's written how the various miracles that Jesus did showed that he was the promised messiah to offer life without ending to whoever would accept that he had been sent by God and trust in his teaching. Although there were indeed many who did believe in him, many others were unable to come to that point and ended up opposing Jesus at every turn.
\ip In chapters thirteen to seventeen, the compassion of Jesus towards his followers is described. He also told them in advance of his impending brutal death.
\ip In the final few chapters, we read about the arrest and judging of Jesus, his being fastened to a pole and giving up his spirit, his coming back to life, and how his followers saw him and spoke with him again during that period.
\ip John is careful to explain how to receive life without ending by means of believing that Jesus came down from heaven and obeying his teaching. Jesus himself is the road, the truth, and the life.

\s1 The coming of the true light
\p
\v 1 In the beginning was the Message,\f + \fr 1:1 \ft TD: This passage is difficult to translate because the Message was also the Messenger—that is Jesus came not only to teach about getting saved, but also to become the actual way to be saved!\f* and the Message was with God, and the Message was God.
\v 2 The Message was with God even at the creation.
\v 3 Everything came into existence through the Messenger\f + \fr 1:3 \ft Lit. him.\f*—not even one thing came into existence apart from him.
\v 4 He holds Life, and¦62964 that Life is the Light of humankind.
\v 5 And that Light is shining¦62978 in the darkness, and¦62979 darkness cannot overcome him.
\p
\v 6 \x + \xo 1:6: \xt Mat 3:1; Mrk 1:4; Luk 3:1-2.\x*A man¦62986 arrived who had been sent¦62987 by God. His name¦62994 was John.
\v 7 He came¦62999 as a testimony to tell about the Light so that everyone would believe the Light.
\v 8 John himself wasn't the Light—he was merely the announcer of the Light.
\v 9 The true Light which enlightens every person was coming¦63034 into the world.
\p
\v 10 He was in the world and he's the creator of the world, and yet the world didn't even know Acts
\v 11 He came¦63059 to his own chosen people, but they wouldn't accept him.
\v 12 But whoever would accept him, whoever trusted in His authority, he gave¦63071 them the right to become¦63078 children¦63076 of God.
\v 13 Not physical children and not coming from human actions, but¦63097 children of God.
\p
\v 14 And the Messenger became¦63106 a human and lived here among us and we¦63112 saw¦63112 his greatness—the greatness of an only child of the Father—full of grace¦63123 and truth¦63125.
\p
\v 15 John explained about him and loudly told everyone, “This is the one I meant when I said, ‘There's someone coming¦63143 after me, yet who came before me, because he existed before I did!’ ”
\p
\v 16 Because he has so much, we all received grace and then even more grace.
\v 17 The commandments came to us through Moses, but grace¦63175 and truth¦63178 came to us through Jesus the messiah.
\v 18 No one has ever actually seen¦63185 God, but the human son born from God the father¦63200, he was the one to explain God to us.
\s1 The interrogation of John-the-Immerser
\r (Mat. 3:1-12; Mrk. 1:1-8; Luk. 3:1-18)
\p
\v 19 John explained some of this when the Jewish leaders sent¦63212 out priests¦63220 and¦63221 temple workers from Jerusalem to ask¦63226 him, “Who are you?”
\p
\v 20 And he didn't flinch from the truth and told them, “I am not the chosen messiah.”
\p
\v 21 \x + \xo 1:21: a \xt Mal 4:5; \xo b \xt Deu 18:15,18.\x*So they asked him again, “Are you Elijah come back to life?”
\p And he answered, “No, I'm not.”
\p They asked, “Are you the prophet?”
\p Again he answered, “No, I'm not.”
\p
\v 22 So they asked him, “Who are you then? We need to give¦63285 an answer¦63284 to the ones who sent¦63287 us. How do you describe yourself?”
\p
\v 23 \x + \xo 1:23: \xt Isa 40:3 (LXX).\x*So he said, “I am a voice shouting\f + \fr 1:23 \ft We've deliberately omitted putting a comma here, because it's also possible that the comma should go after ‘wilderness’.\f* in the wilderness smooth the path of the master, as the prophet Isaiah said.”
\p
\v 24 Some of the ones sent¦63317 out were members of the Pharisee¦63321 party.
\v 25 These ones asked¦63323 John, “So why are you immersing¦63331 people then if you aren't the messiah or Elijah or the prophet?”
\p
\v 26 He answered, “I'm immersing¦63351 people in water, but somewhere here among us all there's someone you don't know—
\v 27 the one coming¦63372 after me, and I'm not even good enough to untie his sandal straps!”
\p
\v 28 All this happened in Bethany on the east side of the Jordan River where John was immersing¦63406 people.
\s1 Jesus gets publicly revealed
\p
\v 29 The next day¦63409 John saw Jesus coming¦63416 towards him, and¦63419 said, “Hey! Here's the sacrificial lamb of God who's come to take away the sin¦63430 of the world.
\v 30 This is the man¦63446 I was talking about when I said, ‘There's someone coming¦63445 after me, yet who came before me, because he existed before I did.’
\v 31 I didn't know who he was but¦63459 nevertheless I came¦63467 and immersed people in water¦63471 so that this man could be revealed to \add all\add* Israel.”
\p
\v 32 And John further explained, “I saw God's spirit¦63481 come down and¦63490 settle on Acts
\v 33 I didn't know which one was Him, but the one who sent me to immerse people in water said, ‘When you see the spirit coming down and settling on someone, he is the one who will immerse people with God's holy spirit.’
\v 34 And I have seen¦63537 that, and¦63538 so I can assure you that he¦63543 is God's son.”
\s1 Jesus gets a few followers
\p
\v 35 The next day¦63549, John¦63554 was back there with two¦63560 of his apprentices
\v 36 and noticing Jesus walking¦63565 nearby he said, “Look! There's the sacrificial lamb of God.”
\p
\v 37 When his two¦63585 apprentices heard him say that, they left him and followed¦63592 Jesus¦63594.
\v 38 But Jesus turned¦63595 and saw them following¦63602 him, and asked them, “What are you two wanting?”
\p And they said¦63610 to him, “Teacher, where do you stay?”
\p
\v 39 Jesus replied, “Come and see.” So they went with him and saw¦63631 where he lived, and they stayed there that night, because it was already after 4pm.
\p
\v 40 Andrew, the brother¦63652 of Simon Peter was one of those two¦63659 who heard John and¦63664 then followed¦63665 Jesus.
\v 41 As soon as he found his brother, he said to Simon, “We have found the messiah—God's chosen one,”
\v 42 and led him to Jesus. When Jesus saw him, he said, “Ah, you are Simon John but from now on you'll be called Simon Peter which means \it stone\it*.”
\s1 Philip and Nathanael join the group
\p
\v 43 The following¦63734 day¦63717, Jesus wanted¦63719 to go to Galilee. He found Philip and¦63729 told him, “Follow me!”
\v 44 Philip was from the town of Bethsaida where Andrew and¦63748 Peter lived.
\v 45 Philip then found Nathanael and told him, “We've found the one that Moses and the prophets wrote¦63758 about in the Scriptures. He's Jesus from Nazareth.”
\p
\v 46 And Nathanael said, “Does anything good¦63785 come from Nazareth?”
\p So Philip answered, “Well, come and¦63793 see.”
\p
\v 47 Jesus saw¦63795 Nathanael approaching and¦63805 said, “Ah, this is an honest Israeli.”
\p
\v 48 But Nathanael queried him, “Where do you know me from?”
\p And Jesus replied, “Actually I saw¦63842 you under that fig¦63841 tree¦63841 before Philip had even called you.”
\p
\v 49 Nathanael exclaimed, “Great teacher! You \em are\em* God's son! you're the king¦63862 of Israel!”
\p
\v 50 Jesus responded, “So you believe this because I said that I had seen you under the fig¦63882 tree. You'll get to see much greater things¦63888 than that!”
\v 51 \x + \xo 1:51: \xt Gen 28:12.\x*And he continued, “Honestly, I'm telling all of you: you'll be seeing¦63901 the sky opened up and God's messengers going¦63910 and and coming¦63912 down on me, mankind's child.”
\c 2
\s1 The wine miracle
\p
\v 1 On the Tuesday\f + \fr 2:1 \ft Or possibly, ‘Three days later’.\f*, there was a wedding in Cana in Galilee, and¦63932 Jesus' mother¦63935 was there.
\v 2 Jesus and¦63945 his apprentices were also invited.
\v 3 When the wine ran out at the wedding, Jesus' mother¦63968 said to him, “They haven't got any more wine.”
\p
\v 4 Jesus answered, “What does that have to do with us, mother? It's not yet the time for my ministry.”
\p
\v 5 But his mother¦63997 told the servants, “Just do whatever he tells you.”
\p
\v 6 Now there were six¦64015 empty stone¦64013 water jars there that are used for Jewish purification ceremonies. (Each one could hold over 70 litres.)
\v 7 So Jesus told them to fill the jars with water, and they¦64042 filled them up.
\v 8 Then he said, “Ok, now take a sample out and give it to the MC.” So they took some.
\v 9 And when the MC tasted the water that had now turned to wine (but he didn't know where it had come from), he called the groom
\v 10 and exclaimed, “Most people supply the best wine at the beginning, and the cheaper stuff when people are a bit tipsy. But you've kept the best wine until last!”
\p
\v 11 This event in Cana, Galilee, was the first of the miracles that Jesus did and it revealed his greatness, and his followers believed that he was from God.
\p
\v 12 \x + \xo 2:12: \xt Mat 4:13.\x*After that, Jesus and his mother¦64156 and brothers¦64160 and his followers travelled east to Capernaum, but they¦64168 only stayed there a few days¦64172.
\s1 Jesus disturbs the temple traders
\r (Mat. 21:12-13; Mrk. 11:15-17; Luk. 19:45-46)
\p
\v 13 \x + \xo 2:13: \xt Exo 12:1-27.\x*It was getting close to the time of the Jewish Feast of the Passover, and¦64181 Jesus went¦64182 down to Jerusalem.
\v 14 There in the temple, he discovered merchants selling cows and sheep¦64200 and doves, and moneychangers sitting at their tables.
\v 15 Jesus formed some cords into a whip and drove the sheep¦64227 and cows out of the temple grounds, and he overturned the tables¦64241—spilling the coins of the moneychangers onto the ground.
\v 16 He scolded the ones selling doves, saying, “Get them out of here. Don't be making my father's house into a market.”
\v 17 \x + \xo 2:17: \xt Psa 69:9.\x*That reminded¦64267 his followers of the scripture: “I'll be filled with zeal for your temple.”
\p
\v 18 Then the Jewish leaders responded, “Do a miracle to show that you have the authority to do these things¦64299.”
\p
\v 19 \x + \xo 2:19: \xt Mat 26:61; 27:40; Mrk 14:58; 15:29.\x*But Jesus answered, “Well, destroy this temple and I'll raise\f + \fr 2:19 \ft We couldn't easily use \em rebuild\em* here because there's a play on words—see verse 21.\f* it¦64316 again in three¦64313 days¦64314.”
\p
\v 20 The leaders smirked, “This temple took 46-years to build, and you'll raise it¦64339 again in three¦64336 days¦64337?”
\p
\v 21 But Jesus had been meaning his own body¦64348 when he was talking about the temple.
\v 22 In the future when he was actually raised¦64353 from the dead, his followers remembered this statement, and they believed both the Hebrew scriptures and Jesus' message¦64371.
\s1 Jesus does miracles and knows thoughts
\p
\v 23 And when Jesus was at the Passover Feast in Jerusalem, many believed in his authority because they saw the miracles that he was able to do.
\v 24 But Jesus¦64404 never fully entrusted himself to them, because he knew what people are like.
\v 25 (He didn't need anyone to tell him what people are like because he could see what any person was like on the inside.)
\c 3
\s1 Jesus tells Nicodemus about the need to be reborn
\p
\v 1 One night a Jewish leader named Nicodemus who was a member of the Pharisee party
\v 2 came to Jesus and said, “Teacher, we know that God has sent you as a teacher¦64469, because no one could do these kinds of miracles if God wasn't with him.”
\p
\v 3 Jesus responded, “I'll tell you frankly that no one can enter God's kingdom¦64511 unless he is reborn.”
\p
\v 4 Nicodemus questioned, “How could an adult be reborn? A person can't just return to their mother's womb and¦64538 then get born again!”
\p
\v 5 And Jesus continued, “Honestly, I'm telling you: unless a person is born from both water¦64554 \em and\em* the spirit, they can't enter God's kingdom.
\v 6 Someone that's born from a body is flesh, but someone that's born from God's spirit is spiritual.
\v 7 So you shouldn't be surprised that I told you that everyone needs to be reborn.
\v 8 The wind blows wherever it wants, and you hear its sound but you can't actually see where it's coming from and where it's going. So too with everyone born from God's spirit.”
\p
\v 9 Nicodemus replied, “How can all this even happen?”
\p
\v 10 And Jesus answered, “You're a Jewish teacher¦64645 and yet you¦64651 don't know all this?
\v 11 It's true that we just teach what we know, and explain what we've seen¦64663 ourselves, but you people aren't accepting our testimony.
\v 12 If I tell you all earthly things and you don't believe them, how will you ever believe if I explain \em heavenly\em* things?
\v 13 None of you have gone up into heaven, except that I¦64710, mankind's child, have come down from heaven.
\p
\v 14 \x + \xo 3:14: \xt Num 21:9.\x*“Just like Moses lifted up that \add bronze\add* snake \add on a pole\add* in the wilderness, it's necessary for mankind's child to be lifted up,\f + \fr 3:14 \ft lifted up / exalted: See https://bibleDifferences.net/2019/04/25/156-exulted\f*
\v 15 so that everyone¦64736 who believes in him¦64742 won't die, but will live forever.\f + \fr 3:15 \ft See http://bibleandtech.blogspot.com/2021/03/john-314-21-translation-and-commentary.html\f*
\p
\v 16 “Because in the same way, God loves the people of the world enough to cause his only son to be born and to give him¦64772 to the world, so that everyone¦64767 who believes this will not die, but¦64776 will live forever.
\v 17 God didn't send his son here to condemn poeple, but¦64796 rather to save them.
\v 18 The one who trusts in me will not be condemned. However, the one who doesn't believe this has already been condemned because he rejected the authority of the only son that God fathered.
\v 19 And this is the verdict: that light has come into the world, but some people¦64842 loved the darkness more than the light because they do evil things,
\v 20 because everyone who does evil things hates the light and doesn't come to the light so that their actions won't be exposed.
\v 21 But whoever does what is right and true comes toward the light¦64890 so that their actions can be revealed as being done with God's help.”
\s1 John approves of Jesus' popularity
\p
\v 22 After this, Jesus and his followers went down to Judea, and stayed there and immersed some believers.
\v 23 John was also immersing¦64933 people at Aenon near Salim because there was plenty of water¦64941 there and people would come to get immersed.
\v 24 \x + \xo 3:24: \xt Mat 14:3; Mrk 6:17; Luk 3:19-20.\x*(At this time, John¦64957 had not yet been put in prison¦64955.)
\v 25 Then a debate about purification started between John's followers and a religious leader.\f + \fr 3:25 \ft https://www.billmounce.com/monday-with-mounce/what-does-the-word-%E2%80%9Cjew%E2%80%9D-mean-you-john-3-25\f*
\v 26 So they came to John and said, “Teacher, that man that came to you across the river and that you testified about, now \em he's\em* immersing people and so they're all going to him.”
\p
\v 27 John answered, “None¦65011 of us get anything if it's not being given from heaven¦65027.
\v 28 \x + \xo 3:28: \xt Jn 1:20.\x*You yourselves know that I said¦65033 that I'm not the messiah, but¦65041 rather the one coming before him.
\v 29 It's the groom that has the bride—the best man is happy because he sees that the groom is happy. So I'm actually completely happy with all this.
\v 30 It's right and proper that he should increase and I should fade out.”
\p
\v 31 “The one who came down from heaven is greater than any of us. We came from this world and speak in our worldly ways. The one who came down from heaven is greater than any of us.
\v 32 He explains about what he's seen¦65122 and¦65123 heard, but¦65127 people don't believe him.
\v 33 Whoever does believe him, confirms that God is true.
\v 34 The one that God sent¦65148 tells us God's words, because God doesn't ration his spirit.
\v 35 \x + \xo 3:35: \xt Mat 11:27; Luk 10:22.\x*The Father loves the Son and has put him¦65178 in charge of everything.
\v 36 Whoever believes the Son will live forever, but whoever disobeys the Son won't be seeing life, but will feel God's severe anger.”

\s1 Jesus chats with a woman at the well
\p
\v 1 When Jesus found out that the Pharisee party knew¦65209 that he was gaining and immersing¦65223 more followers than John had,
\v 2 (although actually it wasn't Jesus¦65228 himself¦65229 that was immersing¦65232 them, but¦65233 his trainees were doing it),
\v 3 he left Judea and¦65241 went¦65242 back up to Galilee.
\v 4 On the way up, he decided to go through Samaria¦65253.
\p
\v 5 \x + \xo 4:5: \xt Gen 33:19; Josh 24:32.\x*Because of that, they came to a town in Samaria called Sukar, which was near the place Joseph had inherited from his father Jacob,
\v 6 and Jacob's well was there. Jesus was tired from all the walking and was sitting at the well around midday.
\p
\v 7 A woman¦65304 came from the town to get water¦65309 from the well, and Jesus asked her¦65311 for a drink
\v 8 since his followers had gone into the town to buy some lunch.
\p
\v 9 \x + \xo 4:9: \xt Ist 4:1-5; Neh 4:1-2.\x*The woman said to him, “You're a Jew. How come you're asking me for a drink when I'm from Samaria?” (Jews don't normally associate with anyone from Samaria.)
\p
\v 10 Jesus answered, “If you had recognised God's gift¦65368 and who it is who's asking you for a drink, you would have asked me and I would have given you \em living\em* water.”
\p
\v 11 But the woman¦65396 countered, “Mister, you don't even have \add rope and\add* a bucket to reach the water in the deep well. How then could you get living water?
\v 12 I doubt that you're greater than our ancestor Jacob¦65429 who made this well for us, and drank this water along with his children and his animals.”
\p
\v 13 Jesus responded, “Everyone who drinks this water¦65465 will get thirsty again,
\v 14 but whoever drinks the water that I give them will find a well springing up inside them—springing into eternal life¦65506.”
\p
\v 15 The woman¦65512 said, “Ok. Give me some of that water¦65518 so that I won't get thirsty and won't have to keep coming out here to the well.”
\p
\v 16 Jesus said, “First, go and get your husband¦65540 and return here.”
\p
\v 17 But she retorted, “I don't have a husband!”
\p And Jesus said, “True enough—indeed you don't.
\v 18 You've had five¦65568 husbands¦65570 and you're not married to the man you're living with, so that was true.”
\p
\v 19 The woman¦65588 reacted, “Mister, I can see that you're a prophet.
\v 20 Our ancestors worshipped on this mountain, but you¦65605 Jews claim that people should only worship there in Jerusalem.”
\p
\v 21 Then Jesus told her, “You need to believe that I was sent from God, woman¦65625, because a day is coming¦65627 when everyone will be worshipping him neither on this mountain, nor in Jerusalem.
\v 22 You people in Samaria don't even know who you¦65649 worship, but we do, because people will be saved by means of us Jews.
\v 23 But a time is coming, starting even now, when the true worshippers will be worshipping the father in spirit and truth, because those are the ones that he is wanting to worship him.
\v 24 God is spirit, and the ones worshipping him must worship in spirit and total honesty.”
\p
\v 25 The woman¦65710 said, “I'm aware that the messiah is coming—the chosen one of God. Whenever he appears, he'll teach us everything.”
\p
\v 26 And Jesus responded, “I am the messiah. Yes, he's speaking¦65734 to you!”
\p
\v 27 After this, his followers arrived back, and they were astounded that he was speaking with a woman¦65751. However no one dared ask her, “What are you after?” Or to ask him, “Why are you talking with her?”
\p
\v 28 So the woman¦65776 left her water jar there, and went¦65778 back into the town where she told the people¦65785,
\v 29 “Come and see¦65787 a man¦65788 who knew as much about me as I know myself! He must be the messiah!”
\v 30 So they¦65809 went out from the town to go and¦65808 see Jesus.
\p
\v 31 Meanwhile, Jesus' followers encouraged him, “Teacher, here, eat.”
\p
\v 32 But he¦65827 said, “I've had food to eat that you¦65836 don't know about.”
\p
\v 33 This made his followers ask each other, “Did you see anyone bring him¦65852 something to eat?”
\p
\v 34 And Jesus explained, “Obeying God who sent¦65867 me is like food to me, and¦65869 I plan to finish his work.
\v 35 Don't you all have a saying about needing to wait four¦65879 months for a harvest? But I'm telling you that you all should open your eyes¦65892 and look at the fields, because they're already colouring with the coming¦65885 harvest.
\v 36 The harvester gets paid with a harvest that will last forever so that the ones who plant and the ones who harvest can all celebrate.
\v 37 There's truth in the statement that one person plants and¦65942 a different person harvests.
\v 38 I've sent¦65947 you all out to harvest where you haven't worked before—others did the groundwork and you benefit from their work.”
\p
\v 39 And many people of Samaria came out of that town and believed that Jesus is God because the woman¦65981 had told them that he knew everything about her.
\v 40 So when they all came, they asked him to stay in their town, and so they stayed on there for a couple of days¦66013.
\p
\v 41 And many more believed as a result of his teaching,
\v 42 so they told the woman, “We no longer believe just because of what you said, but now that we've heard him for ourselves, we can see that he really is the saviour of the world.”
\s1 Jesus heals the official's son
\p
\v 43 After his two¦66065 days¦66066 in Samaria, Jesus continued on up to Galilee.
\v 44 \x + \xo 4:44: \xt Mat 13:57; Mrk 6:4; Luk 4:24.\x*He himself¦66074 said that no prophet gets honoured in his own home town¦66084.
\v 45 \x + \xo 4:45: \xt Jn 2:23.\x* When he got to Galilee, the people accepted him, having seen¦66101 everything that he'd done at the feast in Jerusalem because they had also been there.
\p
\v 46 \x + \xo 4:46: \xt Jn 2:1-11.\x*So he went again to Cana there in Galilee where he had made the water¦66144 into wine. And there was a royal official there, whose son in Capernaum was ill.
\v 47 When the official heard that Jesus was coming¦66163 up from Judea to Galilee, he went¦66171 and asked him if he would come¦66180 and heal¦66183 his son who was dying.
\v 48 Jesus said¦66191 to him, “You people won't believe unless you see¦66203 miracles and other marvels.”
\p
\v 49 But the official begged him, “Sir¦66213, please come¦66215 before my child¦66220 dies.”
\p
\v 50 Jesus responded, “Go back there and see. Your son will recover.”
\p The man¦66236 believed what Jesus had told him, and so he started off.
\v 51 On his way, his slaves¦66256 met him and reported that the boy¦66270 was alive and well.
\p
\v 52 So the official inquired what time it was that he got better, and they replied that the fever had subsided around 1pm.
\v 53 The father¦66305 knew¦66302 that that was the time when Jesus had told him that his son would recover, and as a result his whole¦66330 household believed \add that Jesus came from God\add*.
\p
\v 54 This was the second miracle that Jesus did after leaving Judea and going to Galilee.
\c 5
\s1 Jesus heals a man at the pool
\p
\v 1 After all this, there was another Jewish feast, so Jesus went¦66357 down to Jerusalem.
\v 2 In Jerusalem at the Sheep Gate, there's the Bethsaida pool that has five¦66384 alcoves
\v 3 and a large number of sick, blind, lame, and paralysed people lie there in them.
\v 4 ≈
\v 5 One man¦66441 had been there for thirty-eight years,
\v 6 and when Jesus noticed him and knew that he'd been there for so long, he asked, “Do you want to get better?”
\p
\v 7 The sick man answered, “Yes mister, but¦66500 when the water¦66489 starts moving, I don't have a companion to lift me into the pool, so someone else always get there before me.”
\p
\v 8 Then Jesus said, “Stand up and pick up your bedroll and start walking.”
\v 9 The man immediately stood up, picked up his gear, and started to walk.
\p However, this was the weekly rest day.
\v 10 \x + \xo 5:10: \xt Neh 13:19; Jer 17:21.\x*So the religious leaders said to the man, “Hey! It's against the law for you to carry your bedding on the rest day¦66556!”
\p
\v 11 But the man answered, “The person who made me better told me to pick up my bedroll and¦66590 start walking.”
\p
\v 12 “Oh. Who was it that told you¦66602 to take that stuff and¦66608 start walking?”
\p
\v 13 But the man who had been healed¦66613 didn't even know who it was, because when a crowd had formed, Jesus¦66623 had quickly left.
\p
\v 14 Later on, Jesus found the man in the temple and told him, “Look, you're better now, so don't sin because you don't want anything worse to happen to you.”
\p
\v 15 The man¦66665 then went¦66661 and¦66666 told the leaders that it was Jesus who had made him¦66682 better.
\v 16 As a result, the leaders started harassing Jesus because he had done this on a rest day¦66706.
\v 17 But Jesus just replied, “My father¦66715 is working today, and¦66720 so I'm also working.”
\p
\v 18 Because of this, the leaders became determined that he must be put to death, not just because he broke the rules for the rest day¦66739, but especially because he was calling God his own father¦66742, thus making himself equal to God!
\s1 Authority over life is given to the son
\p
\v 19 So Jesus responded to them, “I want to tell you all something: The son can't initiate anything by himself. He can only do what he sees his father doing, because whatever his father is doing, he also does things like that.
\v 20 You see, the father¦66813 loves his son and shows him everything that he's doing. In fact, he'll be showing him even greater things than what he's done already, so that you all will be amazed.
\v 21 Because the father¦66845 brings the dead back to life, giving them new life, so also the son can give life to whoever he wants.
\v 22 The father¦66866 won't be judging anyone, but¦66869 has already given that task to the son,
\v 23 so that the people might honour the son like they honour the father. But any who is not honouring the son, is also dishonouring the father who sent him.
\p
\v 24 “I assure you that whoever hears my message and believes that I was sent by God, will live forever and will not be condemned, but has moved from death into life.
\v 25 I can also assure you¦66934 that a time is coming, and in fact is here already, when the dead¦66943 will be hearing the voice of the son of God and that voice will bring them back to life.
\v 26 As the the father¦66962 is the source of life, he gave the power of giving life to the son
\v 27 and gave¦66985 him the authority¦66983 to be the final judge, because he is mankind's child.
\v 28 Don't be surprised at this, because a time is coming¦66999 when everyone in their graves will be hearing his voice,
\v 29 \x + \xo 5:29: \xt Dan 12:2.\x*and the ones having done what is good¦67024 will be given new life¦67028, and the ones having done what is evil¦67033 will be condemned.
\s1 The unbelief of the religious leaders
\p
\v 30 Jesus continued explaining to the religious leaders, “I don't do anything in isolation. As I hear from him, only then do I judge and my judgement is correct and impartial because I'm not imposing my desires, but the desire of the one who sent¦67073 me.
\p
\v 31 “If I just testify about myself, my testimony would not be correct or even valid.
\v 32 But it's another one that's testifying about me, and¦67093 I know that his testimony about me is true.
\v 33 \x + \xo 5:33: \xt Jn 1:19-27; 3:27-30.\x*You sent¦67107 people out to question John¦67109 and¦67110 his testimony was true.
\v 34 But I don't even need testimony that comes from people, because I am teaching you¦67128 how to be saved.
\v 35 John was a bright and shining¦67137 light¦67147 and you¦67138 appreciated it for a short time.
\v 36 But I have a stronger testimony than John's because the father has entrusted works to me to complete, and which I'm already doing and which clearly show that the father sent me here.
\v 37 \x + \xo 5:37: \xt Mat 3:17; Mrk 1:11; Luk 3:22.\x*And since he sent¦67192 me, he himself has testified about me. You people have never listened to his voice, nor have you ever seen¦67211 him!
\v 38 And his way of thinking is obviously not in your minds, because you don't believe the one that he sent.
\v 39 You look in the Jewish scriptures because you suppose that they'll lead you to eternal life¦67240. Those very scriptures testify about me coming,
\v 40 yet you refuse to come¦67256 to me in order to receive life¦67260.
\p
\v 41 “I'm not getting any praise from people
\v 42 but I do know that you people don't actually love¦67276 God in your hearts.
\v 43 I have come in my Father's name and you don't accept me, but if someone came in their own name, you'd happily accept them.
\v 44 How \em could\em* you possibly believe when you just accept acclamations from each other, but don't even seek praise from the only \add God\add*.
\v 45 But don't be assuming that I'll be accusing you all in front of the Father. No, the one who'll accuse you is Moses because he's the one that you're hoping you'll please.
\v 46 The trouble is that if you actually believed what Moses wrote, you would believe me, because Moses was writing about me.
\v 47 But since you don't really believe his writings, you're not at all likely to believe me.”
\c 6
\s1 The feeding of 5,000 families
\r (Mat. 14:13-21; Mrk. 6:30-44; Luk. 9:10-17)
\p
\v 1 After all this, Jesus crossed the lake \add in a boat\add*.\f + \fr 6:1 \ft Here John also uses the Roman name “Lake Tiberias” rather than just “Lake Galilee”.\f*
\v 2 A large crowd followed him¦67397 because they¦67404 had seen his miraculous healings of sick people.
\v 3 Jesus climbed a hill and¦67425 sat there with his apprentices.
\v 4 At that time, it was getting close to the Jewish Feast of Passover.
\v 5 When Jesus looked out and¦67453 saw the large crowd coming, he asked Philip, “Where can we¦67467 get enough food from to feed all this crowd?”
\v 6 But he was only saying¦67478 this to test Philip because he already knew what he was going¦67486 to do.
\p
\v 7 Philip answered, “It would take quite a few months wages to buy even just a snack for this many people.”
\p
\v 8 Now one of Jesus' apprentices, Simon Peter's brother, Andrew, said to Jesus,
\v 9 “There's a boy¦67521 here with five¦67527 buns and¦67530 two¦67531 small cooked fish¦67532, but¦67533 that wouldn't even start to feed this crowd.”
\p
\v 10 But Jesus told them to get all the people¦67547 to sit down as there was a large grassy area. So they all sat down—some five¦67569 thousand men¦67563 were counted.
\v 11 Then he took the buns and gave thanks to God, and started passing around both the buns and the fish¦67597, and everyone ate as much as they wanted.
\v 12 Once everyone was full, Jesus got his apprentices to collect the left-over fragments so as not to waste anything.
\v 13 So they gathered¦67618 the left-overs and filled twelve¦67626 baskets with left-over bread.
\p
\v 14 The people¦67642 who had witnessed this and other miracles said, “This really is the prophet that God promised to send!”
\v 15 But Jesus¦67665 knew that they intended to come and grab him to announce him as their king, so he moved out of the crowd and on up the hill.
\s1 Jesus comes walking across the lake
\r (Mat. 14:22-33; Mrk. 6:45-52)
\p
\v 16 As it¦67694 moved into evening, Jesus' apprentices went back down to the lake
\v 17 and having boarded the boat¦67707, they¦67708 set out across the lake toward Capernaum. By then it was dark, and there was still no sign of Jesus.
\v 18 Then a strong wind hit the lake and the water got rough.
\v 19 When they had rowed about five¦67756 kilometres, they saw Jesus¦67761 walking¦67762 on top of the lake and approaching the boat¦67771, and they were very scared.
\v 20 But he told them, “Don't worry—it's me.”
\v 21 After that they were willing to let him into the boat, and immediately the boat was at their arrival place.
\p
\v 22 The next day, the crowd looked across the lake and saw that only one small boat had crossed, and they knew that only Jesus' apprentices had boarded that boat and left, and not Jesus himself.
\v 23 Other boats¦67874 came¦67872 across from Tiberias near the place¦67885 where they¦67888 had eaten the bread¦67890 after the Master had given thanks.
\v 24 So when all the people saw¦67897 that Jesus wasn't around and his apprentices had left, they went off looking for Jesus in Capernaum.
\s1 The bread that enables true life
\p
\v 25 When they found him there across the lake, they queried, “Teacher¦67942, when did you come¦67947 here?”
\p
\v 26 And Jesus answered, “Honestly, I know that you're looking for me, not because you saw¦67962 miracles, but because you all had plenty of food to fill you up.
\v 27 Don't \add just\add* work for the food which goes off, but¦67982 for the food which lasts forever, which mankind's child will give to you¦67996 because God the Father has put his mark of approval on Acts”
\p
\v 28 Puzzled, they asked him, “What should we be doing if we want to do God's work?”
\p
\v 29 He answered, “Doing God's work is putting your trust in the one that He sent¦68041 here.”
\p
\v 30 “If so,” they said, “what miracle will you do for us to see¦68057 so that we can believe in you? What can you do?
\v 31 \x + \xo 6:31: \xt Exo 16:4,15; Psa 78:24.\x*Our ancestors ate the manna out in the wilderness, as Moses wrote, ‘He gave¦68080 them bread¦68076 from heaven¦68079 to eat.’ ”
\p
\v 32 Jesus said to them, “Actually I can tell you that it wasn't Moses who gave them bread from heaven, but my father¦68105 gives you the real bread from heaven,
\v 33 because the bread¦68119 of God is the one who came down from heaven¦68128 and¦68129 who gives life¦68130 to the world.”
\p
\v 34 So they¦68136 requested, “Mister¦68140, always give¦68143 us that bread.”
\p
\v 35 But Jesus answered, “\em I am\em* the bread¦68157 that gives life¦68159—whoever comes to me will never hunger, and¦68170 the one believing in me, will never be thirsty again.
\v 36 But as I said¦68182 already, although you have seen¦68186 me you refuse to believe me.
\v 37 Everyone that the Father gives to me will come to me, and¦68202 I certainly won't turn away anyone who comes to me,
\v 38 because I came¦68214 down from heaven¦68218, not to do what I want, but¦68227 to do what the one who sent¦68231 me wants.
\v 39 And what He wants is for me to not lose any that he's given to me, but¦68254 to bring them back to life on the last day¦68262.
\v 40 My father¦68272 wants everyone¦68277 who watches me and believes in me to live forever, because I will bring them back to life¦68289 on that last day¦68299.”
\p
\v 41 This little speech made the religious leaders grumble about him because he had said¦68308 that he was the food that came down from heaven¦68317,
\v 42 as they figured out, “This is Jesus the son of Joseph and so we know his parents. So how can he say that he come down from heaven¦68353?”
\p
\v 43 Jesus scolded them, “Don't be grumbling to each other.
\v 44 No one can join me unless the Father who sent¦68380 me attracts them, and¦68386 then I'll be bringing them back to life on the last day¦68394.”
\v 45 \x + \xo 6:45: \xt Isa 54:13.\x*The prophets wrote that the people will be taught by God. And everyone who's heard and¦68414 learned from the Father comes to me.
\v 46 Not that any person has seen the Father—only the one who came from God has seen Acts
\v 47 I tell you¦68446 sincerely: the one who believes \add in me\add* will live forever.
\v 48 I am the bread¦68458 that gives true life¦68460.
\v 49 Your ancestors ate manna in the wilderness, but they¦68475 all went on to die.
\v 50 I am the bread¦68479 that came down from heaven¦68483 and¦68493 whoever eats this will not die.
\v 51 I am the living bread that came down from heaven¦68507 and if anyone eats this bread, he will live through to the next age.”
\p
\v 52 At this point, the religious leaders began to argue with each other, “How could this man give¦68562 us his flesh to eat?”
\p
\v 53 So Jesus explained, “Indeed if you don't eat my flesh and drink my blood¦68596, you aren't truly alive!
\v 54 The person who eats my flesh and drinks my blood¦68620 will gain eternal life—I will bring them back to life on the last day¦68632.
\v 55 For my flesh is the true food, and¦68641 my blood¦68643 is the true drink.
\v 56 Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood¦68693 lives in me, and I will live in him.
\v 57 The father is alive and sent me here, and I am alive because of Him, so also the person who eats me will be alive because of me.
\v 58 Unlike your ancestors who ate that bread and then died, whoever eats this bread that came down from heaven¦68763 will live through to the next age.”
\s1 Many people find the teaching too difficult
\p
\v 59 Jesus taught all of this in the meeting hall there in Capernaum¦68797.
\v 60 But even many of Jesus followers who heard it said, “This is difficult teaching—it's too hard to take.”
\p
\v 61 But Jesus already knew inside that his followers were grumbling about this and asked them, “Do you¦68844 find this offensive?
\v 62 What if you were to see mankind's child ascending to where he came from?
\v 63 It's the spirit that is the source of life, not the body. The concepts that I've taught you are all spiritual and life-giving.
\v 64 But there are some here who don't believe me.” Actually, Jesus had already known from the beginning just who would believe and¦68912 which person would betray him.
\v 65 So he said, “That's why I told you that no one can come¦68931 to me unless the Father has given them to me.”
\p
\v 66 After this, many of his followers went¦68954 back and no longer accompanied him around.
\p
\v 67 So Jesus said¦68964 to the twelve¦68970, “Don't you also want to leave?”
\p
\v 68 \x + \xo 6:68-69: \xt Mat 16:16; Mrk 8:29; Luk 9:20.\x*Simon answered, “Master, if we went, who would we follow then? you're the \add only\add* one who teaches about living forever.
\v 69 We believe and¦68994 know that you¦68998 are the holy son of God.”
\p
\v 70 Jesus responded, “Didn't I choose all twelve¦69023 of you myself? And yet one of you is a devil.”
\v 71 (He was talking about Judas, son of Simon Iscariot, because he was the one who would go on to betray him.)
\c 7
\s1 Jesus' sceptical brothers dare him to go public
\p
\v 1 After all this, Jesus travelled around Galilee. (He didn't want to travel around Judea because the leaders there wanted to execute him.)
\v 2 \x + \xo 7:2: \xt Lev 23:34; Deu 16:13.\x*As it was now getting close to the Jewish Feast with Tents,
\v 3 his brothers¦69099 said¦69093 to him, “You should leave this place and go down to Judea so that all your followers can see the miracles that you're doing.
\v 4 You don't do things¦69143 out of the main stream if you want to become well-known. If you want to do miracles, show yourself to the wider world.
\v 5 (You see, not even Jesus' own \add half-\add*brothers believed \add that he came from God\add*.)
\p
\v 6 So Jesus responded, “Well, you guys can do that any time, but it's not the right time for me yet.
\v 7 All the people won't hate you¦69189 guys, but¦69191 they do hate me because I teach about the evil¦69203 things they are doing.
\v 8 You all go down to Jerusalem ahead of me. I'm not going¦69215 to the feast yet because it's not yet the right time¦69225 for me.”
\v 9 After saying this, Jesus stayed up in Galilee.
\s1 Jesus starts teaching about authentic justice
\p
\v 10 But after his \add half-\add*brothers had left to go down to Jerusalem, Jesus also went—not in the public limelight but just incognito so to speak.
\v 11 However at the celebrations, the Jewish religious leaders were searching for him, and were asking around where he was.
\p
\v 12 Even among the crowds there was a lot of quiet banter with some saying that Jesus is a good man and others complaining that he was misleading the people.
\v 13 Either way, no one was speaking¦69309 out in public about him, because they were afraid of the reaction of the religious leaders.
\p
\v 14 Finally sometime in the middle of the celebrations, Jesus¦69329 went¦69326 into the temple and¦69333 started teaching in there.
\v 15 Even the Jewish leaders were surprised, asking, “How can this man know so much when he hasn't been trained as a teacher?”
\p
\v 16 Jesus himself responded, “My¦69351 teaching doesn't come from me, but¦69360 from the one who sent¦69362 me.
\v 17 If anyone wants to do God's will, they'll soon figure out whether my teaching comes from God, or if I'm just making it¦69381 up myself.
\v 18 Any person who just teaches his own thoughts is just seeking their own advancement, but¦69398 whoever wants to promote the one who sent¦69403 them, this is authentic and¦69408 there's no hidden self-interest.
\v 19 Didn't Moses write down God's commandments for you, yet not a single one of you obeys them. Why are you wanting to execute me?”
\p
\v 20 “You must be demon-possessed,” said some in the crowd, “Who would be wanting to execute you.”
\p
\v 21 Jesus responded, “I did one miracle and you¦69457 were all amazed.
\v 22 \x + \xo 7:22: a \xt Lev 12:3; \xo b \xt Gen 17:10.\x*Moses gave you the commandment about circumcision (even though it actually came from before his time), but to obey this, you'll even circumcise a baby boy on the Rest Day.
\v 23 \x + \xo 7:23: \xt Jn 5:9.\x*So if a male can be circumcised on the Rest Day so that Moses' commandments aren't broken, they why did you get angry with me because I made a man healthy of the Rest Day?
\v 24 Don't just judge things so you yourselves look good, but¦69515 judge impartially, seeking the best for others.”
\s1 Could Jesus be the messiah?
\p
\v 25 After this, some of the locals from Jerusalem started asking, “Isn't this the man they¦69531 were wanting to execute?
\v 26 Here he is teaching in public, yet they're not even confronting him. Perhaps the leaders know that this really is the messiah?
\v 27 But we¦69558 even know where this man is from. Surely when the messiah comes, no one would know his family background.”
\p
\v 28 So as Jesus continued teaching, he called out, “Indeed you all know me and my home and family. But I didn't come¦69609 here of my own accord, but the one who sent¦69615 me here is truthful, even though you don't even know him.
\v 29 I know him, because I came from him, indeed, he was the one who sent¦69632 me here.”
\p
\v 30 So now they really want to arrest him, but no one touched him because it was not yet the proper time.
\v 31 Many in the crowd did believe that he was from God, and they were saying, “When the messiah comes, would he do greater miracles than what we've seen this man¦69687 do?”
\s1 Jesus discusses leaving as they aim to arrest him
\p
\v 32 The Pharisee party heard the crowd muttering about these things¦69700 and sent¦69702 out some of their servants along with the chief priests¦69706 to go and arrest Jesus.
\v 33 So Jesus said, “I'll only be with you¦69727 all for a short while longer and¦69729 then I'll be going¦69730 to the one who sent¦69733 me.
\v 34 You'll look for me but won't be able to find me, and you aren't able to go where I'll be going.”
\p
\v 35 The leaders wondered, “Where could he be going that we wouldn't be able to find him? Will he go and live with the Jews living among the Greeks and start teaching the Greeks?
\v 36 And what does he mean about looking for him and not being able to find him, and not being able to go where he goes?”
\s1 Jesus offers living water to the crowd
\p
\v 37 \x + \xo 7:37: \xt Lev 23:36.\x*On the final climax day¦69812 of the celebrations, Jesus stood there and shouted, “Anyone who's thirsty, come here to me and drink.
\v 38 \x + \xo 7:38: \xt Eze 47:1; Zech 14:8.\x*Whoever trusts me will have rivers of living¦69854 water¦69853 flowing out from him¦69851 just like the scriptures say.”
\v 39 He was talking about God's spirit that the ones who trust him would receive in the future—not yet because Jesus hadn't been lifted up to heaven yet. 
\s1 The people are divided about Jesus
\p
\v 40 When some in the crowd heard his teaching, they¦69906 said, “He really is the \add coming\add* prophet.”
\v 41 Others said, “He must be the messiah.”
\p But some pointed out, “The messiah won't come from Galilee.
\v 42 \x + \xo 7:42: \xt 2Sam 7:12; Mic 5:2.\x*Don't the scriptures say that he'll be a descendant of King David and¦69946 that he'll come from David's town of Bethlehem?”
\v 43 And so the crowd was divided about Jesus.
\v 44 Some \add of the servants\add* wanted to arrest him, but decided to leave him alone \add for now\add*.
\s1 The leaders distrust Jesus and mock his followers
\p
\v 45 So when servants returned back to the chief priests¦70001 and the Pharisees, they were asked, “Why haven't you¦70012 brought him?”
\p
\v 46 They answered, “We've¦70027 never heard anyone speak like he does.”
\p
\v 47 The Pharisees asked them, “Don't tell us that you've also been taken in by him?
\v 48 None of our leaders or any of us Pharisees believe that he's from God.

\v 51 “Since when did our rules allow us to judge a person before we've even heard them out and¦70108 investigated what they're doing?”

\v 52 But they sneered, “And do you come from Galilee as well? Look in the scriptures and you'll soon see¦70131 that no prophet emerges out of Galilee.”

\s1 The two witnesses of Jesus' authenticity
\p
\v 12 \x + \xo 8:12: \xt Mat 5:14; Jn 9:5.\x*Because of this, Jesus told them, “\em I am\em* the light of the world—whoever follows me won't walk in the darkness but will have the light of life¦70429.”
\p
\v 13 \x + \xo 8:13: \xt Jn 5:31.\x*Some from the Pharisee party argued, “You are testifying about yourself, so that testimony is invalid.”
\p
\v 14 Jesus responded, “Even when I am testifying about myself, my testimony is valid, because I know where I came¦70470 from and where I'm going.
\v 15 You all are judging according to your earthly values. I'm not judging anyone.
\v 16 But even if I was judging, my judgement would be correct, because it wouldn't just be me judging, but also the father¦70519 who sent¦70517 me.
\v 17 \x + \xo 8:17: \xt Deu 19:15.\x*It's even written in your¦70526 own laws that the testimony of two¦70531 men¦70532 is valid.
\v 18 So that's me testifying about myself, plus the father¦70552 who sent¦70550 me also testifies about me.”
\p
\v 19 “And where is your father?” they asked.
\p Jesus answered them, “You don't know either me nor my father. If you did know me, then you'd also know my father.”
\p
\v 20 He explained all this while he was teaching in the treasury part of the temple, but no one arrested him because the time for his \add suffering\add* had not yet arrived.
\s1 You can't go where I'm going
\p
\v 21 So he continued, “I will be going away and all of you will be looking for me, but you'll all just die in your sins and won't be able to go where I'll be going.”
\p
\v 22 This puzzled the Jewish teachers, “Surely he's not going to commit suicide! What else could he mean about ‘you can't go where I'm going to be going’?”
\p
\v 23 Jesus explained, “All of you¦70672 are from the world below, but I'm from the world above. You all are part of this world, but I'm not part of it.
\v 24 That's why I said that you'll be dying in your sins, because if you refuse to believe that I am \add God\add*, you will indeed be dying in your sins.”
\p
\v 25 “So who are you?” they asked.
\p And he answered, “Still just the same as I've been telling you from the beginning.
\v 26 I have a lot that I need to tell you all and to judge many of your actions, because the one who sent¦70745 me is true, and it's what I hear from him¦70755 that I speak to all people.”
\p
\v 27 (They didn't realise that he was talking to them about the father¦70767 \add in heaven\add*.)
\v 28 So Jesus told them, “When you all lift up\f + \fr 8:28 \ft lifted up / exalted: There's a play on words here. See https://bibleDifferences.net/2019/04/25/156-exulted (dead link???)\f* mankind's child \add on a pole\add*, then you will know that I am \add God\add*, and I don't do anything by myself, but I say all this just as the father¦70808 told me to.
\v 29 And the one who sent¦70815 me is with me—he didn't just leave me alone—because I am continually doing what pleases him.”
\p
\v 30 After he'd said all this, many people believed in him.
\s1 Jesus teaches about freedom from slavery
\p
\v 31 Because of this, Jesus told all the Jews who believed in him, “If you all continue to believe my message¦70858, then you're my true followers.
\v 32 You will have known the truth, and the truth will set you free.”
\p
\v 33 \x + \xo 8:33: \xt Mat 3:9; Luk 3:8.\x*But some queried, “We are Abraham's descendants and¦70884 we've never been slaves to anyone, so how can you¦70892 say that we'll be set free?”
\p
\v 34 And Jesus answered, “I can assure you all that anyone who sins is a slave to sin.
\v 35 And the slaves don't necessarily remain in the \add family\add* home forever—only the children have that right.
\v 36 So if the son sets you free, then you'll be truly free.
\s1 Jesus spars with the Jewish religious leaders
\p
\v 37 “Yes, I know that you're all descendants of Abraham, but you're trying to kill me because my message¦70963 doesn't lodge in you.
\v 38 Indeed I talk about what I've actually seen with the father, but you all are doing what you've heard from your father.”
\p
\v 39 But they retorted, “Abraham is our father.”\f + \fr 8:39 \ft father meaning ancestor. (Abraham lived some 2,000 years before the time of these events.)\f*
\p And Jesus responded, “Well, if you really were descendants of Abraham, you'd behave more like him.
\v 40 But instead you're trying to find a way to have me killed—to kill the man¦71035 who has spoken the truth to you—truth that I heard from God. Abraham never did that.
\v 41 you're doing what your father wants you all do to.”
\p But they shot back, “It's not us who was conceived by a couple that weren't even married! Anyway, we only have one father and that's God.”
\p
\v 42 Again Jesus responded, “If God was your father¦71088, you all would be loving me because I came¦71101 from God and for God. I didn't just come¦71111 by myself, but God sent¦71116 me here.
\v 43 Why can't you comprehend what I'm saying? The reason that you can't stand listening to my message¦71132
\v 44 is because you come from your father, the devil, and you want to do what \em your\em* father wants. But he was a murderer from the beginning, and doesn't stick to the truth because there's no truth in him. Whenever he tells lies, he's speaking from his own nature, because he's a liar and the source of lying.
\v 45 But because I'm speaking¦71189 the truth¦71188, you¦71193 don't believe in me.
\v 46 Which of you can scold me for my sins? If I am speaking¦71207 the truth¦71206, why don't you believe I'm from God?
\v 47 Anyone who belongs to God, listens to what God says. But you all can't even hear the message, because you don't belong to God.”
\s1 Jesus preceded, and is greater than, Abraham
\p
\v 48 The Jewish leaders asked, “Aren't we right in saying¦71245 that you're from Samaria and that you have a demon?”
\p
\v 49 “No, I don't have a demon,” Jesus answered, “but I honour my father¦71269 and¦71271 you're dishonouring me.
\v 50 But I'm not seeking greatness for myself—he is the one seeking and the one judging.
\v 51 I can assure you, that anyone who puts my teaching into practice can be certain to avoid death in \add this\add* age.”
\p
\v 52 The Jews said, “Now we \em know\em* that you have a demon! Abraham and the prophets all died, but you're saying¦71329 that those who follow your teaching can be certain to avoid death in \add this\add* age.
\v 53 How could you be greater than our ancestor Abraham who died? Even the prophets died. Who do you think you are?”
\p
\v 54 Again Jesus answered, “If I praise myself, my praise is worthless, but it's my father¦71384 who praises me—the one who you say is your God
\v 55 although in fact you don't even know him. But I have known him, and so I can't say¦71409 that I haven't known him or I'd better a liar like all of you. But I have known him and I am putting his desires into practice.
\v 56 Your ancestor Abraham would have been excited to see me here—in fact he did see ahead and was very happy about it.”
\p
\v 57 Because of that, the Jewish leaders asked, “You aren't even fifty¦71453 years old yet. How could you have seen¦71460 Abraham?”\f + \fr 8:57 \ft Abraham lived some 2,000 years before Jesus.\f* 
\p
\v 58 Jesus answered, “I can assure you¦71472 that \em I am\em*\f + \fr 8:58 \ft This awkward English is necessary to catch the play on words, because ‘I am’ is the meaning of \em Yahweh\em*, the name of God.\f* before Abraham ever existed.”
\p
\v 59 When they heard that, they picked up stones¦71481 to throw¦71483 at Jesus \add to kill him\add*. But Jesus was hidden from their sight, and went on out of the temple.
\c 9
\s1 A blind man obeys and then can see
\p
\v 1 As Jesus was walking along, he¦71505 saw¦71505 a man¦71506 who had been blind from birth¦71509
\v 2 and his followers asked¦71512 him, “Honoured teacher, why was this man¦71521 born blind? Was it because he himself sinned, or his parents?”
\p
\v 3 Jesus answered, “It was neither this man¦71535 nor his parents who sinned, but it was so that God can work in him for others to see.
\v 4 As long as it's daytime, we need to do what the one who sent¦71559 us wants. When night comes, no one will be able to work.
\v 5 \x + \xo 9:5: \xt Mat 5:14; Jn 8:12.\x*As long as I'm here in this world, I am the light¦71579 of the world.”
\p
\v 6 After he'd said¦71584 this, Jesus spat on the ground and after mixing some clay into a slurry, he spread it on the eyes¦71603 of the man
\v 7 and told him, “Now go and wash in the Siloam Pool.”\f + \fr 9:7 \ft Siloam means ‘to be sent out’.\f*
\p
\v 8 Then the neighbours of the man and others who had seen him earlier, knowing that he was a beggar asked, “Isn't he the one who always sat and begged here?”
\p
\v 9 And indeed, some were saying, “Yes, this is him.” But others were saying, “No, but he looks quite similar.”
\p And the man said, “I \em am\em* him.”
\p
\v 10 So they¦71673 asked him, “Well, how come you¦71686 can see now?”
\p
\v 11 “A man named Jesus made a slurry” he said, “and spread it on my eyes and told me to go and wash at Siloam Pool. So I went and did it, and when I washed my eyes, I could see.”
\p
\v 12 “Where is he now?” they¦71731 asked.
\p “I don't know.” said¦71731 the man.
\s1 The Pharisees can't accept the healing of the blind man
\p
\v 13 Then they brought the man¦71750 who had been blind to the Pharisees¦71747.
\v 14 Now, it¦71751 had been the Rest Day when Jesus had made the slurry and¦71764 enabled him¦71768 to see,
\v 15 and because of this, some in the Pharisee party asked him how it was that he could see now. And he answered, “Well, he put a slurry on my eyes¦71793 and when I washed them, I could see.”
\p
\v 16 So some of them said, “Clearly that man is not from God because he doesn't respect the Rest Day.”
\p However others said, “But if he's just a sinner, how could he do miracles like that?”
\p
\v 17 So they asked the man who had been blind, “Well, what do you have to say because it was your eyes¦71861 that he opened?”
\p “He must be a prophet,” the man said.
\p
\v 18 But some of the Jews weren't even sure that he really had been blind and could now see, so they called for his parents
\v 19 and asked¦71894 them, “You two say that this is your son and that he was born blind. If so, how come he can see now?”
\p
\v 20 His parents answered, “We know that he's our son, and we know that he was born blind.
\v 21 But as for how come he can now see, we don't know that. Nor do we know who healed his eyes¦71953. But ask¦71964 him—he's old enough to speak for himself.”
\v 22 (His parents said these things¦71970 because they were afraid of the Jewish religious leaders, because the leaders had already announced that anyone who said that Jesus was the messiah would get banned from all religious services,
\v 23 so that's why they had said, “He's old enough—just ask¦72009 him.”)
\p
\v 24 So the leaders summoned the man born blind a second time and commanded him, “Only praise God himself for this, because we know that that man is a sinner.”
\p
\v 25 “Well, I don't know whether or not he's a sinner,” said the man. “All I know if that I used to be blind but now I can see.”
\p
\v 26 They asked again, “What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes¦72078?”
\p
\v 27 And he answered, “I already told you that and you didn't even listen. Why do you want to hear it all again? Do you all want to become¦72105 his followers as well?”
\p
\v 28 Then they¦72109 insulted him¦72111 and¦72112 said, “You might be a follower of that man, but¦72123 we are followers of Moses.
\v 29 We know that God spoke to Moses, but¦72144 we¦72146 don't even know where this other fellow is from.”
\p
\v 30 The man responded, “Wow, that's pretty amazing. This man opened up my eyes¦72179, and you teachers don't even know where he's from!
\v 31 We know that God doesn't listen to sinners, but he listens to those who worship him and do what he wants.
\v 32 In all the centuries we never heard that a person could give sight to someone who was born blind.
\v 33 If this man¦72220 isn't from God, surely he¦72227 wouldn't be able to do that!”
\p
\v 34 They reacted, “You're just an ignorant sinner, and you think you can teach <em>us</em>!” Then they had him thrown out the door.
\s1 Spiritual blindness and hypocrisy
\p
\v 35 Jesus heard that they had thrown out the man who could now see, and when he found him, he said, “Do you believe that mankind's child \add came from God\add*?”
\p
\v 36 And the man answered, “Mister, who is he so that I can believe in him?”
\p
\v 37 “You've seen¦72301 him and heard him and he's speaking¦72305 to you right now,” said Jesus.
\p
\v 38 And the man responded, “I do believe, master.” Then he knelt down in front of Jesus.
\p
\v 39 Jesus said, “I came¦72334 into this world to dispense judgement, so that the people who can't see will be able to see, and¦72341 so that the ones who can see will become¦72346 blind.”
\p
\v 40 The Pharisees with him heard that and asked, “Are you saying that we're blind?”
\p
\v 41 “If you were blind,” Jesus replied, “you wouldn't be sinning, but since you all declare that you can see, then your sin remains.”
\c 10
\s1 The sheep know their true master
\p
\v 1 “Honestly I can tell you: It's not the person that enters the sheep¦72414 enclosure by the gate that is a thief and¦72422 robber, but¦72415 rather the one who climbs in a different way.
\v 2 The one that comes in the gate is the shepherd¦72433 of the sheep¦72438.
\v 3 The gatekeeper opens up for him, and when he calls the sheep by name¦72461 they listen to his voice and he leads them out.
\v 4 Whenever he moves the sheep, he goes in front and the sheep follow him because they recognise his voice.
\v 5 They would never follow¦72491 a stranger because they wouldn't know his voice, in fact they'd run away from him.
\p
\v 6 Jesus told them this illustration, but none of those who heard it knew¦72517 what it meant.
\s1 Jesus is the good shepherd
\p
\v 7 So Jesus continued, “Honestly I will tell you¦72535 that \em I am\em* the entrance for the sheep¦72545.
\v 8 The ones who came¦72548 before me are thieves and¦72554 robbers, but¦72556 the sheep¦72563 didn't listen to them.
\v 9 \em I am\em* the entrance. Anyone who comes in via me will be saved, and will be able to go in and out and find pasture.
\v 10 The thief only comes to steal and kill and destroy, but I came¦72600 so that they could live, and live a full life¦72602.
\p
\v 11 “\em I am\em* the good shepherd—the good shepherd gives his own life¦72621 for the sheep¦72627.\f + \fr 10:11 \ft See http://bibleandtech.blogspot.com/2021/04/john-1011-18-translations-and-notes-rcl.html\f*
\v 12 The paid worker is not even the shepherd, because the sheep aren't his own and if he sees a wolf coming he just abandons the sheep and takes off and the wolf scatters the sheep and snatches some—
\v 13 that's because he's just a worker and doesn't really care about the sheep¦72680.
\v 14 \em I am\em* the good¦72686 shepherd¦72684 and I know my \add sheep\add* and they know me,
\v 15 \x + \xo 10:15: \xt Mat 11:27; Luk 10:22.\x*just like the father knows me and I know the father—in fact I will give my life for the sheep.
\v 16 I also have other sheep which are not in this field¦72735 and it's appropriate for me to bring those other sheep also, then they'll be hearing my voice because there'll be just one flock with one shepherd.
\p
\v 17 The father¦72760 loves me because I am laying down my life¦72767 so that I can receive it¦72772 again.
\v 18 No one is taking it from me, but I'm laying it down myself. I have authority to lay it down, and also authority to receive it back again because I received this command from my father¦72807.”
\p
\v 19 The Jewish religious leaders were again divided about Jesus' teaching
\v 20 with many of them saying, “He's got a demon,” and, “He's stark raving mad—why are you¦72835 all even listening to him!”
\p
\v 21 But others were saying, “He doesn't sound like he's demon-possessed. And how could a demon make a blind man see?”
\s1 The Jewish leaders won't accept Jesus' teaching
\p
\v 22 By then it was winter and the time for the Jewish Feast of Dedication in Jerusalem.
\v 23 Jesus was walking¦72872 in the temple in an area known as Solomon's Porch
\v 24 when he was surrounded by the Jewish religious leaders and interrogated, “How long do you plan to keep us in suspense for? If you are the messiah, tell us clearly.”
\p
\v 25 So Jesus answered, “I already told you all but you didn't believe me. The miracles that I do with the authority of my father¦72934 testify about me,
\v 26 but you don't believe them either because you aren't part of my flock.
\v 27 My sheep¦72962 listen to my voice, and I know them and they¦72975 follow after me.
\v 28 I give them life¦72982 which will never end so they¦72987 won't ever be destroyed, and no one will be able to snatch them away from me.
\v 29 My father is the one who gave them to me, and he's more powerful than any other, so no one can snatch them away from him.
\v 30 The father¦73032 and¦73030 I are one.”
\p
\v 31 Again the Jewish leaders picked up rocks to throw at him to kill him.
\v 32 But Jesus asked, “I showed you all many miracles from my father¦73060. Which miracle do you want to kill me for?”
\p
\v 33 \x + \xo 10:33: \xt Lev 24:16.\x*They answered, “It's not for any \em good\em* deed that we think you deserve to die, but because you, a human, dishonour God by claiming to be him.”
\p
\v 34 \x + \xo 10:34: \xt Psa 82:6.\x*Jesus answered, “Isn't it written in your scriptures that God said, ‘You all are gods’?”
\v 35 Now the scriptures can't be wrong, and¦73132 if the ones who heard teaching from God were called gods,
\v 36 why are you¦73147 telling the one that the father¦73140 blessed and¦73142 sent¦73143 out into the world that I am insulting God because I said¦73152 that I'm God's son?
\v 37 If I'm not doing my father's work, then you don't need to believe that he sent me,
\v 38 but if I am doing his work, even if you don't believe that he sent me, at least believe in what I do so that you all can know that the father is in me and I'm in the father.”
\p
\v 39 That was enough that they tried yet again to arrest him, but he was able to get away from their influence.
\p
\v 40 \x + \xo 10:40: \xt Jn 1:28.\x*Then Jesus crossed the Jordan river to the place¦73227 where John had immersed the people, and he stayed there.
\v 41 Many people visited him there, and they were saying that even though John had never done even one miracle, on the other hand, everything that he had said about Jesus was true,
\v 42 and many people there believed that Jesus was from God.
\c 11
\s1 Jesus is aware of Lazarus' death from afar
\p
\v 1 \x + \xo 11:1: \xt Luk 10:38-39.\x*Now there was a man¦73277 called Lazarus who lived in the village of Bethany along with his sisters Martha and¦73288 Mary.
\v 2 \x + \xo 11:2: \xt Jn 12:3.\x*(Mary was the one who <a href="#C12V3">later</a> poured fragrant oil over Jesus and wiped his feet¦73310 with her hair.) But now their brother¦73318 was seriously ill
\v 3 and so the two sisters¦73330 sent¦73324 a message to Jesus saying, “Master, this man that you¦73342 love is seriously ill.”
\p
\v 4 However, when Jesus got the message he said, “This sickness won't end in death but in honour for God, so that his son will also be honoured because of it.”
\p
\v 5 Now it was true that Jesus loved the three of them.
\v 6 Yet when he heard that Lazarus was sick, he stayed in the place¦73406 where he was for two¦73407 more days¦73408
\v 7 before he said to his followers, “It's time to head down to Judea again.”
\p
\v 8 But they double-checked, “Honoured teacher, the Judeans wanted to execute you, so do you really want to go back there again?”
\p
\v 9 And Jesus answered, “There are twelve hours of light in the day. Anyone who walks during the daytime doesn't stumble because he is seeing the light of this world.
\v 10 But anyone who walks at night will stumble, because the light¦73481 is not in them.”
\v 11 And he continued, “Our friend¦73497 Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I'm going¦73502 so that I can wake him up.”
\p
\v 12 But his followers objected, “Master, \add it's good\add* if he's sleeping because it helps with healing.”
\p
\v 13 But Jesus had spoken about Lazarus' death—not just normal sleep as they had thought.
\v 14 So Jesus told them plainly, “Lazarus is dead
\v 15 and I'm glad that I wasn't there, because you all will benefit as your faith grows. Anyway, let's get moving.”
\p
\v 16 Thomas (nicknamed ‘Twin’) grumbled to the others, “Yeah, we might as well go so that we can get killed as well.”
\s1 Jesus is the resurrection and the life
\p
\v 17 So when they eventually arrived, Lazarus¦73589 body had already been in the burial chamber for four¦73597 days¦73599.
\v 18 The village of Bethany was less than three kilometres from Jerusalem,
\v 19 so many of the Judeans there had come¦73625 out to console Martha and¦73631 Mary after the death of their¦73638 brother.
\p
\v 20 As soon as Martha heard that Jesus had arrived, she went out to meet him, but Mary stayed behind where she was sitting in the house¦73657.
\v 21 Martha cried, “Jesus, master. If you'd been here, my brother¦73679 wouldn't have died,
\v 22 because I already know that anything that you ask from God, he will give it to you.”
\p
\v 23 Jesus responded, “Your brother¦73709 will come back to life.”
\p
\v 24 “Yes, I know that he'll come back to life at the resurrection on the last day¦73725,” said Martha.
\p
\v 25 But Jesus continued, “\em I am\em* the resurrection and¦73736 the life¦73738. Anyone who believes that I'm from God, even if they die¦73744 they'll still be living,
\v 26 and everyone¦73748 who's alive and believes that I was sent from God, will not die¦73757 in the next age.
\p
\v 27 Martha replied, “Yes, master, I do believe that you¦73774 are the messiah, God's son, the one sent into this world.”
\s1 Jesus weeps with his close friends
\p
\v 28 After saying this, Martha went¦73792 and quietly called her sister¦73797 Mary, “The teacher¦73806 is on his way and he wants to see you.”
\v 29 So Mary quickly¦73818 stood up and¦73819 went to find him.
\v 30 At that stage, Jesus hadn't yet come¦73828 into the village proper, but¦73835 was still at the edge where Martha had met him.
\v 31 The Judean people who'd been sitting with Mary in sympathy there in the house¦73856, when they saw her get up quickly¦73865 and go out, they assumed that she was going¦73878 to the cemetary to weep there.
\p
\v 32 But when Mary found Jesus, she¦73891 knelt at his feet¦73906 and said, “Master, if you'd been here my brother¦73921 wouldn't have died.”
\p
\v 33 Now when Jesus saw¦73926 her weeping there, along with the others that had followed also weeping, he himself was quite affected and groaned inside,
\v 34 but he just asked, “Where has he been laid?”
\p “Master, come and see,” they replied.
\p
\v 35 Then Jesus \add broke down and\add* wept,
\v 36 which made the others comment, “See how much he cared about him.”
\p
\v 37 But some of them mocked, “This is the man who could make a blind man see again. How come he wasn't able to stop this man from dying!”
\s1 Jesus calls Lazarus back to life
\p
\v 38 So Jesus who was still holding back sobs, went to the cemetary. Lazarus' body had been placed in a cave with a stone¦74021 blocking it,
\v 39 and Jesus instructed them to take away the stone¦74030.
\p Martha (the sister¦74036 of the dead man) spoke up, “Master, the stink will be bad because it's already been four days.”
\p
\v 40 But Jesus responded, “Didn't I tell you that if you would believe, then you would see God's power?”
\v 41 So they took¦74064 the stone¦74068 away and Jesus looked upwards and said, “Father, I thank you that you listen to me.
\v 42 Actually I know that you always hear me, but I said¦74104 that for the sake of these people so that they will believe that it¦74104 was you who sent¦74110 me here.”
\v 43 After saying that, he¦74116 shouted, “Lazarus¦74119, come¦74121 out!”
\v 44 Then the man who had died¦74127 \add slowly\add* shuffled out—still with linen strips wrapped around his hands¦74136 and his feet¦74131, and a cloth wrapped around his face.
\s1 The leaders create a plan to execute Jesus
\r (Mat. 26:1-5; Mrk. 14:1-2; Luk. 22:1-2)
\p
\v 45 Because of that, many of the Judeans believed that Jesus was from God after having followed Mary and¦74171 seeing what Jesus did.
\v 46 But others went¦74187 and¦74192 told the Pharisee party what Jesus had done.
\v 47 So the chief priests¦74206 and the Pharisee party called a formal meeting and asked, “What should we¦74215 do because this man is doing many miracles.
\v 48 If we allow him to continue like this, all the crowds will be believing he's the messiah, and then the Romans will come and destroy both our temple and our governance.”
\p
\v 49 But one of them, Caiaphas who was chief priest¦74261 that year, spoke up, “You don't know anything.
\v 50 Don't you all realise that its better for all of us if one man¦74281 dies so that the people¦74285 and the nation¦74290 won't be destroyed?”
\v 51 He didn't say this from his own thinking, but being chief priest¦74300 that year, he was announcing God's message that Jesus was going¦74310 to die for the nation¦74317,
\v 52 and not only for this nation¦74322, but¦74324 for all of God's children¦74328 scattered around the world to become united.
\p
\v 53 As a result, from that day¦74343 on they decided that Jesus needed to be executed.
\v 54 Because of that, Jesus no longer walked around Judea in public, but¦74360 went¦74361 out to the town of Ephraim out in the wilderness and¦74374 stayed there with his followers.
\p
\v 55 At that time, the Jewish Passover celebrations were approaching, and¦74392 many people from the regions went¦74393 to Jerusalem ahead of the celebrations to purify themselves.
\v 56 They were looking out for Jesus and as they stood around in the temple, asked each other, “What do you think? Surely he won't come¦74433 to the celebrations.”
\v 57 The chief priests¦74442 and the Pharisee party had already announced that if anyone knew where Jesus was, they must inform them so that they could arrest him.
\c 12
\s1 Mary sacrifices expensive fragrant oil
\r (Mat. 26:6-13; Mrk. 14:3-9)
\p
\v 1 Because of this, Jesus went to Bethany six days¦74468 before the Passover. This was where Lazarus lived, the one Jesus had brought back to life.
\v 2 So they prepared dinner for him there and Martha was serving¦74496 and Lazarus was among those sitting with Jesus.
\v 3 \x + \xo 12:3: \xt Luk 7:37-38.\x*Then Mary took about 300g of very expensive nard oil and smeared it on Jesus' feet, and then wiped off his feet with her own hair, and the house was filled with the fragrance of the oil.
\v 4 But Judas, one of Jesus' apprentices (the one who would eventually turn him in) complained,
\v 5 “How come this lotion wasn't sold for almost a year's wages and¦74581 then the money given to the poor?”
\v 6 But he said¦74585 this not because he cared for poor people, but because he carried their purse and used to steal from it.
\p
\v 7 But Jesus responded, “Let her¦74617 continue. She has kept this for the time of my burial.
\v 8 \x + \xo 12:8: \xt Deu 15:11.\x*You'll always have poor people with you, but you won't always have me here.”
\s1 The leaders also plan to kill Lazarus
\p
\v 9 When it was discovered that Jesus was there, many Judeans started arriving, not only because of Jesus, but¦74662 also to see¦74668 Lazarus who'd been dead¦74674 and¦74654 Jesus had brought him back to life.
\v 10 But the chief priests¦74681 decided in a meeting that they¦74686 should also have Lazarus¦74685 killed,
\v 11 because many people were ignoring them and¦74696 instead were believing that Jesus came from God.
\s1 Jesus rides into Jerusalem with many cheers
\r (Mat. 21:1-11; Mrk. 11:1-11; Luk. 19:28-40)
\p
\v 12 The next day¦74702 a large crowd of people who had come¦74709 for the celebrations and had heard that Jesus was there in Jerusalem
\v 13 \x + \xo 12:13: \xt Psa 118:25-26.\x*took \add long\add* branches¦74725 from palm trees¦74727 and brought them out as they went to meet him. They called out, “Honoured saviour! The one coming¦74745 in the authority of the master has been blessed \add by God\add*. He's the king¦74751 of Israel.”
\p
\v 14 Now Jesus¦74758 had found a young donkey¦74759 and rode it just like it was written in the scriptures,
\q1
\v 15 \x + \xo 12:15: \xt Zech 9:9.\x*“Don't be worried you¦74775 children of Zion. Your king¦74774 is coming¦74776 mounted on a donkey's foal.”
\p
\v 16 (Jesus' apprentices didn't realise all these things at the time, but it was later after Jesus was lifted up to heaven that they were reminded that these things had been written about him, and that they had happened to him.)
\p
\v 17 People in the crowd were telling each other about how they'd been with Jesus when he'd called Lazarus out from the burial chamber and brought him back to life,
\v 18 So because of this, others also wanted to met Jesus when they¦74848 heard that he'd done that miracle.
\v 19 So the Pharisees discussed this together, “We're getting nowhere with this. Look, it seems like the whole world wants to follow him.”
\s1 Some Greeks want to meet Jesus
\p
\v 20 And some Greek people were also going¦74885 to Jerusalem to worship God at the celebrations
\v 21 and they¦74905 approached Philip from Bethsaida up in Galilee and asked him, “Mister, we'd like to meet this Jesus.”
\v 22 So Philip went and told Andrew, and the two of them went and told Jesus.
\s1 Jesus predicts his death again
\p
\v 23 Now Jesus told them, “The time has come¦74940 for mankind's child to be honoured.
\v 24 I can assure you that unless a wheat seed drops into the ground and dies, it will stay just as it is, but if it dies, it's able to produce a harvest.
\v 25 \x + \xo 12:25: \xt Mat 10:39; 16:25; Mrk 8:35; Luk 9:24; 17:33.\x*Whoever loves their life will lose it, but the one hating their life in this world will stay alive forever.
\v 26 Anyone who wants to serve me needs to follow after me, so that wherever I am, my servant¦75016 will be there also. Anyone who serves me will be honoured by the father¦75030.
\p
\v 27 Now, I'm very troubled. What else could I say¦75039 other than, ‘Father, let me avoid what's coming.’ But it was exactly this that I came¦75050 for.
\v 28 Father, may your name¦75061 and authority be honoured.”
\p And a voice from the sky answered, “I've already brought honour to it and will do so again.”
\p
\v 29 This caused some in the crowd standing there to say that they'd heard thunder while others said that an angel¦75108 must have spoken to Jesus.
\p
\v 30 Jesus responded, “That voice wasn't for my sake, but¦75127 for all of you.
\v 31 This world is about to be judged and its ruler will be thrown out,
\v 32 and when I'm lifted up\f + \fr 12:32 \ft lifted up / exalted: See https://bibleDifferences.net/2019/04/25/156-exulted\f* from the earth, I will attract everyone towards me.”
\v 33 By saying¦75165 this, he was indicating how he was going¦75169 to die.
\p
\v 34 \x + \xo 12:34: \xt Psa 110:4; Isa 9:7; Eze 37:25; Dan 7:14.\x*So the crowd queried him, “We heard from the scriptures that the messiah will stay until the end of the age so why do you¦75193 say that mankind's child will be lifted up. And who is this ‘mankind's child’?”
\p
\v 35 Jesus answered them, “The light will be among you all for just a little bit longer, so get walking while you have the light so that you won't have to deal with darkness. Anyone walking in the dark doesn't know where they're going.
\v 36 While you still have the light, believe in the light so that you will become children of light.”
\p Jesus¦75266 said these things¦75263 and then after leaving them, he was hidden from them.
\s1 Many people refuse to stand for Jesus
\p
\v 37 Even though Jesus had done so many miracles in front of the people, they¦75283 didn't believe that he was the messiah.
\v 38 \x + \xo 12:38: \xt Isa 53:1 (LXX).\x*This fulfilled what the prophet Isaiah wrote,
\q1 “Master, who believed our report?
\q1 And who was the master's power revealed to?”
\p
\v 39 Because of this, they¦75311 weren't able to believe, and again as Isaiah¦75319 wrote,
\q1
\v 40 \x + \xo 12:40: \xt Isa 6:10 (LXX).\x*“He has blinded their eyes and maimed their emotions,
\q1 so that they can't see with their eyes and understand with their minds,
\q2 or they might be turned and then I would heal them.”
\p
\v 41 Isaiah wrote this because he saw¦75358 his greatness and spoke¦75365 concerning him.
\v 42 Likewise, many of the Jewish leaders believed that Jesus was the messiah, but they didn't tell others because they didn't want the Pharisee party to banish them from the services
\v 43 as they¦75390 valued the praise of people more than praise from God.
\s1 It's Jesus' teachings that will judge the hearers
\p
\v 44 Then Jesus called out, “Anyone who believes that I came from God is not \add just\add* believing in me, but¦75422 \add also\add* believing in the one who sent¦75425 me,
\v 45 and anyone who watches me \add working\add*, is watching the one who sent¦75434 me.
\v 46 I came into this world as light¦75437 so that anyone who believes in me won't have the darkess residing in them.
\v 47 I won't be judging anyone who hears my teaching and¦75462 doesn't obey it, because I didn't come to judge the world but¦75479 rather to save¦75481 it.
\v 48 Whoever rejects me and¦75487 doesn't accept my teaching does have a judge though—it's the message¦75498 that I spoke¦75500 that will judge them at the end of time
\v 49 because I wasn't speaking from my own thoughts, but¦75516 it was the father¦75520 himself¦75521 who sent¦75518 me that told me what to say¦75528 and¦75529 what to teach.
\v 50 And I'm fully aware that \add obeying\add* his commands leads to living forever. Therefore whenever I speak, I just say whatever the father¦75552 said¦75549 to me.”
\c 13
\s1 Jesus washes the feet of his apprentices
\p
\v 1 Even before the actual feast part of the Passover celebrations, Jesus knew that his time had come, when he would leave this world and \add return\add* to the father¦75581. He loved his followers who were in the world right through to the end.
\p
\v 2 And now it was getting near time for the dinner and the devil had already put the idea into Judas Iscariot's mind to hand Jesus over \add to the authories\add*.
\v 3 Jesus knew that the father¦75632 had given everything to him, putting it under his control, and he knew that he had come from God and would return to God.
\v 4 So he got up from the dinner \add table\add*, changed out of his clothes, and wrapped a linen towel around himself.
\v 5 Then he put water¦75667 into the wash bowl and started washing the feet¦75678 of his apprentices, wiping them dry with the linen towel that was he was wearing wrapped around him.
\v 6 After he'd washed a few, he got to Simon Peter who asked him, “Master, are you going to wash my feet¦75705?”
\p
\v 7 And Jesus answered, “What I'm doing now you won't really understand, but in the future you will.”
\p
\v 8 Peter responded, “Well I'm never ever going to let you wash \em my\em* feet¦75739!”
\p “If I don't wash them,” Jesus answered, “then you won't be included in my \add group\add*.”
\p
\v 9 “Well, if that's so,” Peter said, “don't just wash my feet¦75767 but¦75770 my hands¦75773 and my head as well.”
\p
\v 10 Jesus responded, “Any person who's already washed \add themselves\add* only needs to wash their feet¦75794 now to be clean. And so you're clean, but not every one of you.”
\v 11 He said¦75818 this last bit because he already knew who was going to hand him over.
\p
\v 12 \x + \xo 13:12-15: \xt Luk 22:27.\x*So when he'd finished washing their feet¦75828, he got dressed again and sat down and asked, “Do you know what I just did to you all?
\v 13 You call me teacher and master, and so you¦75857 should, because I am.
\v 14 So if the master and teacher of you all washed your feet, then you also ought to wash each other's feet.
\v 15 I have given this to you all as an example that you can also do to others.
\v 16 \x + \xo 13:16: \xt Mat 10:24; Luk 6:40; Jn 15:20.\x*I can assure you that a slave¦75904 isn't greater than his master, and an ambassador¦75911 isn't greater than the \add king\add* who sends him.
\v 17 If you can figure all this out and then do it, you will be blessed \add by God\add*.
\p
\v 18 \x + \xo 13:18: \xt Psa 41:9.\x*“But I'm not talking about all of you. I know each one that I chose, but¦75936 this \add that was written\add* in the scriptures must be fulfilled,
\q1 ‘The one sharing food with me, lifted up his boot against me.’
\v 19 So I'm telling you now before it happens so that when it does happen, then you'll all believe that I am \add the messiah\add*.
\v 20 \x + \xo 13:20: \xt Mat 10:40; Mrk 9:37; Luk 9:48; 10:16.\x*I can assure you¦75976 all that anyone who accepts any person that I might send, they're accepting me, and¦75988 whoever accepts me, is accepting the one who sent¦75995 me.”
\s1 Jesus indicates who will hand him over
\r (Mat. 26:20-25; Mrk. 14:17-21; Luk. 22:21-23)
\p
\v 21 After saying these things¦75997, Jesus was troubled in himself and said, “I can assure you that one of you will be handing me over.”
\p
\v 22 This made his apprentices glance around at each other, puzzled about which one he was talking about.
\v 23 One of them that Jesus especially liked,\f + \fr 13:23 \ft This apprentice, unnamed here, is assumed to be the author of this account (being shy or modest).\f* was leaning against him¦76042 \add at the table\add*.
\v 24 So Simon Peter nodded to him to find out who Jesus had been talking about,
\v 25 and he¦76085 leaned back on Jesus and asked \add quietly\add*, “Master, who is it?”
\p
\v 26 Jesus answered, “It's the one I hand this piece of bread to after I've dipped it \add in the sauce\add*.” Then after dipping his piece of bread, he gave it to Judas Iscariot.
\v 27 After accepting the piece of bread, Satan entered into him, and then Jesus told him, “What you're about to do, do it soon.”
\v 28 But none of the others sitting around the table knew¦76154 what Jesus meant.
\v 29 Some of them thought that since Judas held their purse, perhaps Jesus was getting him¦76177 to buy something they needed for the feast, or to give¦76194 something to the poor.
\p
\v 30 Anyway, having eaten the piece of bread, Judas went straight outside where it¦76204 was already dark.
\s1 The new command to love each other
\p
\v 31 After he had gone, Jesus told the others, “Now mankind's child will be honoured and God will be honoured through him.
\v 32 Also God himself will be honouring him and will do that immediately.
\v 33 My friends, I'll be with you only a little bit longer. You'll all look for me and as I told\x + \xo 13:33: \xt Jn 7:34.\x* the religious leaders, you won't be able to come¦76269 where I'm going. So now I'm also telling all of you.
\v 34 \x + \xo 13:34: \xt Jn 15:12,17; 1Jn 3:23; 2Jn 5.\x*I'm giving¦76277 you a new commandment—you need to love each other. The way that I loved all of you is how you should love each other.
\v 35 This is actually how you'll know if you are my followers: if you are loving each other.
\s1 Jesus predicts that Peter will disown him
\r (Mat. 26:31-35; Mrk. 14:27-31; Luk. 22:31-34)
\p
\v 36 Now Peter followed-up, “Master, where are you going?”
\p “Where I'm going,” Jesus answered, “you won't be able to follow me at this stage, but you will follow me eventually.”
\p
\v 37 Peter asked again, “Why can't I follow¦76356 after you now? I'm prepared to give my life¦76362 for you.”
\p
\v 38 But Jesus responded, “You think you'll be giving your life¦76376 for me? I can assure you that the rooster won't crow until you've already disowned me three times¦76399.”
\c 14
\s1 Jesus is the road to the father but will be leaving
\p
\v 1 \add Jesus continued telling them,\add* “Don't be living in fear. You believe that God is real, and you also believe that I was sent by him.
\v 2 There are many places to live in my father's residence—I would have told you if there wasn't because I'm going¦76435 there to prepare a place for all of you.
\v 3 And after I've gone to prepare that place¦76448, then I'll be coming¦76451 back again and will bring you to myself, so that where I am, you all can be there also.
\v 4 You know how to get where I'm going.”
\p
\v 5 But Thomas asked, “Master, we don't \add even\add* know where you're going, let alone how to get there.”
\p
\v 6 And Jesus answered, “\em I am\em* the road and the truth¦76506 and the life¦76509. No one can get to the father¦76514 except via me.
\v 7 If you had all known me, you would also know my father¦76526 and from now on you do know him and have seen¦76540 him.”
\p
\v 8 So Philip said, “Master, show us the father¦76550 and¦76551 that'll be enough for us.”
\p
\v 9 But Jesus replied, “I've been with you all for quite some time¦76560, and yet you still don't \add even\add* know me, Philip.
\v 10 You don't believe that I am in the father and the father is in me. These things that I've been telling you all, I don't make them up myself, but the father who lives in me is doing what he wants.
\v 11 You all need to believe that I am in the father and the father is in me. If that's hard, at least believe it because of what he's doing.
\v 12 I can assure you¦76656 all that whoever believes \add that God sent\add* me and is the source of the miracles that I do, that person will be able to do the same and even greater miracles because I am going¦76679 to the father¦76677.
\v 13 Whatever you request from me with my name¦76692 and authority, I will do it so that the father¦76699 might be honoured because of the son.
\v 14 Anything that you¦76706 all request¦76706 using my name¦76710 and authority, it will be done.
\s1 The father will be sending a different advocate
\p
\v 15 “If you all love me, you will obey my commands.
\v 16 And I will ask the father¦76732 and he will give another assistant to you to be with you for this age—
\v 17 the spirit¦76753 of truth¦76755. The world cannot accept him, because it doesn't see or know him.
\p
\v 18 “And I won't leave you all here as orphans, but I will come back to you.
\v 19 It won't be long now and the world won't see me any more, but you will see me because I'll be alive and you all will be alive also.
\v 20 At that time you will know that I am in my father¦76824, and you all are in me, and I am in you all.
\p
\v 21 “Whoever takes my commands and obeys them, that's the person who loves me, and whoever loves me will be loved by my father¦76856, and I will be loving them and will be revealing myself to them.”
\p
\v 22 Judas (not Judas Iscariot) asked, “Master, what's going¦76886 on? Why would you reveal yourself¦76891 to us and¦76892 not to the \add whole\add* world?”
\p
\v 23 Jesus answered, “If anyone loves me, they'll obey my teaching, and my father¦76913 will love them and we will go to that person and live with them.
\v 24 But whoever doesn't love me, won't obey my teaching. The words that you¦76951 hear from me are not my own, but¦76955 come from the father¦76959 who sent¦76957 me.
\p
\v 25 “I told you all this while I have been here with you all.
\v 26 But the pure spirit, the assistant who the father¦76978 will be sending¦76975 with my authority, he will be teaching you everything, and will be reminding¦76989 you of everything that I told you all.
\p
\v 27 I will leave peace with you all. I'm giving my peace to you all, but what I'm giving isn't like what the world gives. Don't be upset or afraid.
\v 28 You all heard me say that I'm going away and then will be coming back. If you really loved me, you'd be very happy that I'm going to the father, because the father is greater than me.
\v 29 But I've told you now before it happens, so that when it does come to pass, you'll be able to believe \add that it was preplanned\add*.
\v 30 I won't have much more time to talk to you, because the ruler of the world is coming¦77068 and he has nothing in common with me,
\v 31 but he's coming so that the world can know that I love the father and whatever the father told me to do, I'm doing it.
\p “Come on, stand up. We need to be leaving this place.”
\c 15
\s1 The branches must stay connected to the vine
\p
\v 1 “\em I am\em* the true vine¦77107 and¦77110 my father¦77112 is the farmer.
\v 2 He takes away every one of my branches that doesn't bear fruit, but those that do bear fruit, he prunes them so they'll produce even more.
\v 3 You all are already clean¦77146 because of the teaching that I've given you.
\v 4 Stay in me, and I will stay in you all, because just as a branch¦77163 can't bear fruit¦77166 in isolation when it's not connected to the vine, neither can you if you don't stay in me.
\p
\v 5 “\em I am\em* the vine¦77193 and you all are the branches. Whoever stays in me will produce a lot of fruit—apart from me you can't do anything.
\v 6 Anyone who doesn't stay in me will be thrown away like a branch, and will wither and be gathered together with others, and thrown into the fire¦77240 to be burnt.
\v 7 If you stay in me and my teaching stays in you, then you can request¦77265 whatever you all want and it¦77268 will be done for you.

\v 12 \x + \xo 15:12: \xt Jn 13:34; 15:17; 1Jn 3:23; 2Jn 5.\x*So here's my request: Keep loving each other just like I loved you¦77366 all.
\v 13 No one has greater love¦77369 than the one who gives up their own life¦77377 for their friends.
\v 14 You are my friends¦77389 if you do what I am telling you.
\v 15 I'm not calling you slaves, because a slave doesn't know his master's plans, but I'm calling you friends¦77420 because I've told you everything that I heard from my father¦77429.
\v 16 You didn't choose me, but I chose you all, and I assigned you to be going and producing fruit and for your fruit to be permanent so that whatever you request from the father¦77467 in my name and authority, he will give it to you.
\v 17 I am telling you all this so that you all can love each other.
\s1 People will hate Jesus-followers
\p
\v 18 If the world hates you, you all know that it hated me before it hated you.
\v 19 If you belong to this world then the world would love you as its¦77502 own people, but you don't belong to this world because I chose you out of it. That's why they hate you all.
\v 20 \x + \xo 15:20: \xt Mat 10:24; Luk 6:40; Jn 13:16.\x*Remember that I told you that slaves are not greater than their master. So if they persecuted me, they'll also be persecuting you all. (If they'd obeyed my teaching, they would also obey your teaching.)
\v 21 But they will do all these things¦77572 against you¦77578 because of my name¦77581 because they don't know the father who sent¦77587 me.
\v 22 They wouldn't be considered sinners except that I came and spoke to them, so now they don't have any excuse for their sin.
\v 23 Anyone who hates me is also hating my father¦77614.
\v 24 If I hadn't done miracles among them of the sort that no one else has done, they wouldn't be considered to be sinners, but now they've observed me and hated¦77640 both me and my father¦77646.
\v 25 \x + \xo 15:25: \xt Psa 35:19; 69:4.\x*The writings of the prophets will certainly come to pass, that ‘they hated¦77662 me undeservedly’.
\p
\v 26 “When the assistant comes that I will send to you all from the father, the spirit of truth coming from the father, he will tell the truth about me.
\v 27 You also will be able to tell the truth about me because you all were with me from the beginning.
\c 16
\p
\v 1 “I've told you this so that you won't stumble.
\v 2 First they will ban you all from their religious services, but there's a time coming¦77716 when people will kill you thinking they're actually doing a sacred service to God,
\v 3 but they'll be doing these things¦77730 because they don't know either the father¦77738 or me.
\v 4 I've told these things to you all so that when they happen in the future, you'll remember that I had already told you about them.
\s1 The work of Spirit of God
\p “I didn't tell you all of this right at the beginning because I was with you all,
\v 5 but soon I'll be returning to the one who sent me. Yet none of you are asking¦77783 me where I'll be going,
\v 6 rather you are all just weighed down because I've told you these things¦77790.
\v 7 But honestly it's for your benefit that I will leave here, because if I don't, then the assistant won't be coming¦77819 to you. But after I've gone, I'll send him¦77830 to you all.
\v 8 And when he comes, he'll scold the world about sin¦77840 and teach them about righteousness and judgement—
\v 9 about sin¦77848 because they¦77852 don't believe that I was sent by God,
\v 10 about righteousness because I am going¦77863 to the father¦77861 and you¦77866 won't be able to see me any longer,
\v 11 and about judgement, because the ruler of this world has been judged.
\p
\v 12 “I still have a lot to tell you all, but you're not able to handle it all right now.
\v 13 But when the assistant comes, the spirit¦77895 of truth, he will guide you in all truth because he won't be speaking from his own thoughts, but will tell you what he's been told, and he will explain to you what's still going to happen.
\v 14 He'll be honouring me because he'll take what is mine and¦77939 will explain it to you¦77942 all.
\v 15 Everthing that the father¦77947 has is mine, that's why I said¦77952 he take what is mine and explain it to you.
\s1 A brief upset coming followed by happiness
\p
\v 16 “Not much longer and you won't be able to see me any more, and then a little while after that, and you'll see me again.”
\p
\v 17 This got his followers asking each other, “What's all this about seeing him for not much longer, and then seeing him again after a while? And why does he say he's going¦78012 to the father¦78015?”
\v 18 So they¦78016 were saying, “What's this about ‘not much longer’? We don't know what he means.”
\p
\v 19 However Jesus knew¦78033 what they wanted to ask him, and so he said to them, “You are trying to find out from each other what I meant when I said that you won't be able to see me after a little while, and then a little while after that you'll see me again.
\v 20 I can assure you that you'll be weeping and mourning but the world will be elated. You'll be upset but then your upset will turn into happiness.
\v 21 A woman¦78094 giving birth has a pains when the delivery begins, but when she hears that the baby is born, she doesn't remember those pains any more because she's so happy that her child¦78110 was born.
\v 22 So too with all of you: you'll be upset for a while but then I'll be with you again and you'll be so happy and no one will be able to take that happiness away from you.
\p
\v 23 “When that happens, you won't be asking¦78165 me for anything. I can assure you that whatever you request¦78177 from the father¦78179 in my name¦78184 and my authority will be given to you.
\v 24 Up until now you haven't asked \add him\add* for anything using my authority, but then you'll be able to make requests and they'll be answered so that your happiness will be complete.
\s1 A new era is coming very soon
\p
\v 25 “So far I've told you these things in parables, however a time is coming when I'll no longer be speaking in parables but will tell you things about the father¦78230 quite plainly.
\v 26 At that time you'll have my authority to request from the father¦78255. I'm not saying¦78249 that I'll be asking¦78253 him on your behalf,
\v 27 no, because he¦78261 himself loves you all because you have loved me and have believed that I was sent by God.
\v 28 I was sent out by the father and I have come into the world, but I'll be leaving the world again and returning to the father.”
\p
\v 29 Jesus' followers responded, “Ah, now you're speaking plainly and not using parables.
\v 30 Finally we realise that you know everything already and don't need to ask anyone else, and so we now believe that you came¦78335 from God.”
\p
\v 31 Jesus answered, “So you¦78341 all believe now?
\v 32 The time is coming¦78345 and is here already when you all will be scattered in various directions and will leave me by myself, but I won't be alone because the father¦78370 is \add always\add* with me.
\v 33 I've told you these things¦78374 so that you all can have peace¦78381 in me. You will have troubles in this world, but be courageous because I have overcome the world.”
\c 17
\s1 Jesus prays for his current and future followers
\p
\v 1 After Jesus had finished speaking, he looked up to the sky¦78408 and said, “Father, it's now the time for you to honour your son so that the son can honour you.
\v 2 You already gave¦78427 me authority¦78429 over all people so that I could grant eternal life¦78444 to everyone¦78433 that you've given me.
\v 3 And eternal life¦78451 means knowing you, the only true God, and knowing me—Jesus the messiah that you sent.
\v 4 I honoured you here on the earth by completing everything that you gave me to do.
\v 5 So father¦78495, now you yourself can honour me with the greatness that I had when I was together with you before the creation of the world.
\p
\v 6 “I revealed your power to the ones that you gave me from this world. They were yours and you gave them to me, and they have obeyed your teaching.
\v 7 Now they understand that everything that you gave to me came from you,
\v 8 because I passed on to them the messages¦78563 that you gave¦78567 to me, and they accepted them. Now they believe that I came¦78583 from you and that it was you who sent¦78590 me here.
\p
\v 9 “I'm asking about them. It's not the people of this world that I'm asking about, but about the ones that you gave to me because they belong to you.
\v 10 Everything that's mine is yours, and everything that's your is mine, and I have been honoured by their actions.
\v 11 I am about to leave this world and come to you, but they will stay here in it. Holy father¦78662, use your power to keep protect the ones that you gave¦78688 to me, so that they might united just like you and I are one.
\v 12 \x + \xo 17:12: \xt Psa 41:9; Jn 13:18.\x*When I was with them, I protected them with the authority that you gave, and I guarded them so that not one of them perished, except the one who chose destruction so that it will indeed happen as the scriptures foretold.
\v 13 But soon I'll be coming¦78740 to you, and I'm speaking¦78743 these things¦78742 in the world so that they¦78749 will have the same happiness as me and be fulfilled in their lives.
\v 14 I've passed on your teaching to them, and¦78771 the world hated¦78774 them because they¦78779 don't belong to this world, just as I don't.
\v 15 I'm not asking¦78794 you to remove them out of this world, but rather to stop evil¦78807 from overcoming them.
\v 16 They don't belong to this world just as I don't.
\v 17 Purify them with the truth—your message¦78831 is that truth.
\v 18 In the same way that you sent me out into this world, so I also send them out into the world.
\v 19 I'm purifying myself for their sakes so that they¦78860 also may be made pure by the truth¦78864.
\p
\v 20 “But it's not just on behalf of the ones right here that I'm asking, but¦78872 also for all the others who will believe that I came from you when they hear the message¦78881 of these ones
\v 21 so that they will all become united, just as you, father¦78891, are in me and I am in you. I ask that they will also be in us so that the world will be able to believe that it was you who sent¦78913 me here.
\v 22 And the honour that you've given me, I've passed on to them so that they¦78928 can be united just as we¦78932 are one—
\v 23 me in them and you in me so that they can be perfected as one. Then the world will know that you sent¦78959 me here and that you love them like you love me.
\p
\v 24 Father, I want those that you've given me to be with me wherever I am so that they'll be able to see my greatness—the greatness that you gave¦78998 me because you loved me even before the creation of the world.
\v 25 Righteous father¦79006, this world didn't know you, but I know you and these ones know that you sent¦79028 me here.
\v 26 I revealed your power and authority to them and will continue to do so, so that the love with which you love me might be in them, and I too might be in them.”

\s1 Jesus is arrested
\r (Mat. 26:47-56; Mrk. 14:43-50; Luk. 22:47-53)
\p
\v 1 After he'd said¦79055 all this, Jesus and his followers went out of Jerusalem and over the Kidron stream towards a garden that he and his followers entered.
\v 2 And Judas (the one who would hand him over) also knew the place¦79092 because Jesus and his followers often met there.
\v 3 Meanwhile Judas had met with the soldiers and servants of the chief priests¦79114 and the Pharisee party, and they all started coming¦79120 into the garden with lanterns and flaming torches and weapons.
\v 4 Jesus who already knew what was going to happen to him, came forward and¦79129 asked them, “Who are you¦79145 all looking for?”
\p
\v 5 And they answered, “Jesus—the one from Nazareth.”
\p Jesus responded, “\em I am\em* the one.”
\p Judas, the one handing him over, was standing there among them.
\v 6 But when Jesus had said, “I am the one,” they backed away and fell to the ground.\f + \fr 18:6 \ft TD: It's not clear from the original if they fell over backwards, or if they stepped back and then fell forward (either voluntarily or unvoluntarily) onto their knees.\f*
\v 7 So he asked¦79187 them again, “Who are you all looking for?”
\p And they answered, “Jesus—the one from Nazareth.”
\p
\v 8 Jesus responded, “I already told you all that \em I am\em* the one. So if it's me that you're looking for, let these others leave.”
\v 9 (In this way, the statement was fulfilled that Jesus had said¦79221 previously: “I didn't lose any of the ones that you¦79224 gave me.”)\f + \fr 18:9 \ft TD: It's not certain from the original whether v9 was part of Mark's commentary on the events or part of Jesus's response to the arresting party.\f*
\p
\v 10 Then Simon Peter drew the sword¦79239 that he was carrying and swiped at the servant of the high priest¦79247, cutting off his right ear. The servant's name¦79261 was Malchus.
\v 11 \x + \xo 18:11: \xt Mat 26:39; Mrk 14:36; Luk 22:42.\x*But Jesus said¦79268 to Peter, “Put your sword¦79276 back in its sheath. I need to proceed with the plan that the father¦79288 has prepared for me—I can't just avoid the suffering.”
\s1 Jesus is taken to Annas
\p
\v 12 So the soldiers and their commander, and the servants of the Jewish leaders arrested Jesus and tied him¦79310 up.
\v 13 First they¦79312 took him¦79312 to Annas, the father-in-law of Caiaphas who was the chief priest¦79326 that year.
\v 14 \x + \xo 18:14: \xt Jn 11:49-50.\x*(Caiaphas was the one who had suggested that it¦79339 was better for the people¦79346 and the nation if one man¦79341 should die.)
\s1 Peter denies being a Jesus-follower
\r (Mat. 26:59-66; Mrk. 14:55-64; Luk. 22:66-71)
\p
\v 15 Now Simon Peter and another intern were following Jesus, and since that other intern was known to the chief priest, he was allowed to enter following Jesus into the courtyard of the chief priest
\v 16 while Peter waited outside at the door. Then the other intern who was known to the chief priest went back and spoke to the woman at the door and brought Peter in too.
\v 17 But the servant¦79419 girl¦79419 who was watching the door challenged Peter, “Aren't you also one of the followers of that man¦79433?”
\p “No, I'm not,” he responded.
\p
\v 18 Meanwhile the servants and attended had made a fire¦79447 and were standing around it¦79451 warming themselves, and Peter¦79460 also went and stood there to warm himself.
\s1 Annas tries to interrogate Jesus
\r (Mat. 26:59-66; Mrk. 14:69-72; Luk. 22:58-62)
\p
\v 19 Now the chief priest¦79468 interrogated Jesus¦79471 about his followers and¦79476 about his teaching.
\v 20 Jesus answered¦79482 him, “I've spoken openly to the people. I always taught in the meeting halls and in the temple where Jewish people meet. I didn't speak in secret
\v 21 so why are you¦79516 asking¦79516 \em me\em*? Ask the people who heard what I told them—they're the ones who know what I said.”
\p
\v 22 When he said that, one of the attendants standing there slapped Jesus \add on the face\add* and said, “You think you can answer the chief priest¦79549 like that?”
\p
\v 23 But Jesus responded, “If I said anything wrong, tell me my error. But if it was true, why are you¦79570 hitting me?”
\p
\v 24 So Annas sent¦79571 him¦79574 away, still tied up, to Caiaphas the chief priest¦79581.
\s1 Peter again denies following Jesus
\r (Mat. 26:71-75; Mrk. 14:69-72; Luk. 22:58-62)
\p
\v 25 Simon Peter was still standing by the fire warming himself when he was asked, “Aren't you also one of his followers?”
\p But he denied it, saying, “No, I'm not.”
\p
\v 26 One of the servants of the chief priest¦79616 who was a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off said, “Didn't I see you¦79626 in the garden with that Jesus?”
\p
\v 27 But Peter¦79637 again denied it, and¦79638 just then a rooster crowed.
\s1 Pilate interrogates Jesus
\r (Mat. 26:71-75; Mrk. 14:69-72; Luk. 22:58-62)
\p
\v 28 Then they led Jesus out from Caiaphas and towards the residence of the governor. It was now the early hours of the morning and as Jews, they didn't enter the residence of the Roman governor so they wouldn't become defiled and thus unable to eat the Passover meal.
\v 29 So Governor Pilate came¦79672 outside to them and¦79682 asked, “What charge are you¦79687 all bringing against this man¦79690?”
\p
\v 30 They answered, “We wouldn't have brought him to you if he hadn't committed a serious crime.”
\p
\v 31 So Pilate said, “You just take him and judge him yourselves according to your own laws.”
\p But the Jewish leaders responded, “We don't have permission to execute anyone.”
\v 32 (This happened to fulfil what Jesus¦79745 had said\x + \xo 18:32: \xt Jn 3:14; 12:32.\x* about the way that he was going¦79754 to die.)
\p
\v 33 So Pilate went back into his governor's residence and called for Jesus and asked him, “So you're the king¦79777 of the Jews?”
\p
\v 34 “Are you saying¦79791 this yourself,” Jesus asked, “or did others say it¦79796 about me?”
\p
\v 35 Pilate retorted, “Hoy! I'm not a Jew. It was your own people and the chief priests¦79817 that handed you over to me. What have you done?”
\p
\v 36 “My kingdom is not in this world,” Jesus answered, “because if it was, my supporters would have fought so that I wouldn't have been handed over to the Jewish leaders. But no, my kingdom isn't from here.”
\p
\v 37 And Pilate responded, “So you are a king then?”
\p “You're saying that I'm a king,” said Jesus, “and indeed I was born to be a king. I came into the world so that I could testify to the truth.”
\p
\v 38 “\add Yeah.\add* What is truth¦79934?” said Pilate.
\s1 Pilate gives permission to execute an innocent man
\r (Mat. 27:15-31; Mrk. 15:6-20; Luk. 23:13-25)
\p After he'd said this, Pilate went back outside to the Jews and told them, “I can't find anything that he's guilty of.
\v 39 But you have a custom here that the governor can release one prisoner during the Passover. So would you like me to release the king¦79974 of the Jews?”
\p
\v 40 But they¦79977 all yelled back, “No, not this one. Release Barabbas.” (Barabbas was a robber.)
\c 19
\p
\v 1 So Pilate took¦79994 Jesus and¦80001 had him¦80002 flogged.
\v 2 Then the soldiers¦80005 twisted some thorn branches together into a crown and put it¦80011 on Jesus' head, and they dressed him in a \add royal\add* purple robe¦80020.
\v 3 They came up to him and said, “Greetings, you king¦80032 of the Jews,” and then slapped him.
\p
\v 4 Then Pilate went back outside and said to the Jews, “Look here. I'm bringing him out to you so that you all can know¦80058 that I didn't find him guilty of anything.”
\v 5 So they led Jesus out wearing the thorny crown and the kingly robe¦80087, and Pilate said, “Look. Here's the man¦80094.”
\p
\v 6 Now when the chief priests¦80100 and their supporters saw¦80097 him, they yelled out, Execute him on a stake! Execute him on a stake!”
\p Pilate answered, “Well you take him and execute him on a stake, because I haven't found anything that he's guilty of.”
\p
\v 7 The Jews responded, “We have a law and he should be executed according to that law because he said he was the son of God.”
\p
\v 8 Now when Pilate¦80156 heard that, he became more afraid.
\v 9 So he went back inside the residence and asked Jesus, “Where do you come from?”
\p But Jesus didn't answer¦80180 him.
\v 10 So Pilate said, “Why don't you answer me? Don't you realise that I have the authority to release you and I also have the authority to have you executed on a stake?”
\p
\v 11 Now Jesus answered, “You have no authority¦80214 over me, none at all, except what has been granted to you from above. Because of this, the sin¦80234 of the person who handed me over to you is greater.”
\p
\v 12 After hearing this, Pilate wanted to release him. But the Jews yelled out, “If you release that man¦80255, you're no friend of Caesar. Everyone who claims to be a king is no friend of Caesar's.”
\p
\v 13 So now Pilate, having heard all this, brought Jesus outside \add again\add*. Pilate sat down on the judge's seat at a place¦80293 called The Stone Pavement (and called Gabbatha in Hebrew).
\v 14 It was now about noon on the day¦80304 when the Passover meal is prepared, and Pilate said to the Jews, “Look. Here's your king.”
\p
\v 15 They yelled back, “Take him away. Take him away. Execute him on a stake.”
\p Pilate asked them, “You want me to have your king executed on a stake?”
\p “We don't have any king other than Caesar,” the chief priests¦80343 answered.
\p
\v 16 So Pilate handed Jesus over to them, and they took¦80360 him away to be executed on a stake.
\s1 Jesus is hung on a stake
\r (Mat. 27:32-44; Mrk. 15:21-32; Luk. 23:26-43)
\p
\v 17 Carrying the pole\f + \fr 19:17 \ft TD: The Greek word used here is used in other places to mean a stake such as used to make a fence. It's uncertain whether or not it had a horizontal cross-piece, although the Romans did use a range of methods.\f* himself, Jesus arrived at the Place of the Skull (called Golgotha in Hebrew) just out of the city
\v 18 where they secured him to the stake along with two¦80399 others—one stake on each side and with Jesus¦80407 in the middle.
\v 19 Pilate wrote¦80408 out a title and¦80414 put it on the stake: Jesus from Nazareth, the king¦80427 of the Jews.
\v 20 Many Jews read this title because the place¦80444 where Jesus was executed was near the city¦80446, and it had been written in Hebrew, Latin, and Greek.
\v 21 But the chief priests¦80466 of the Jews complained to Pilate, “Don't write ‘The king of the Jews’, but rather ‘The one who said he was king of the Jews’.”
\p
\v 22 However Pilate answered, “What I've written, I've written.”
\p
\v 23 After the soldiers¦80492 had fastened Jesus to the stake, they took¦80499 his clothes and placed in four¦80505 piles, one for each of them. This left his robe, which had been woven from top to bottom in one piece.
\v 24 So they said to each other, “Rather than tear this, let's throw a dice to see who will get it.” (This fulfilled what was written in the scriptures\x + \xo 19:24: \xt Psa 22:18.\x* that said: they divided my garments among themselves and threw a dice for my clothes.) So they went ahead and did that.
\p
\v 25 Meanwhile a group of women had stayed standing near Jesus on the stake: his mother and his aunt, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary from Magdala.
\v 26 When Jesus saw his mother and also the intern that he loved standing nearby, he said to her, “Look, he'll be your son.”
\v 27 And to the intern he said, “Look, she'll be your mother¦80620.” And that intern took¦80628 her into his own \add home\add* from that time.
\s1 Jesus gives up his life on the stake
\r (Mat. 27:45-56; Mrk. 15:33-41; Luk. 23:44-49)
\p
\v 28 Having done this, Jesus knew that everything had been accomplished, and (in order for the scriptures\x + \xo 19:28: \xt Psa 69:21; 22:15.\x* to be fulfilled) said, “I'm thirsty.”
\p
\v 29 There was a container lying there full of vinegary wine, so they placed a sponge on a hyssop stalk, soaked it in the wine, and held it up to his mouth.
\v 30 After Jesus had sucked some wine out, he said, “It is finished.” Then he bowed his head and gave¦80689 up his spirit.
\s1 Jesus' side is pierced with a spear
\p
\v 31 Now because it was the preparation day\x + \xo 19:31: \xt Jn 19:14.\x* for the coming Rest Day, the Jews didn't want the bodies¦80706 to remain on the stakes after dusk (because it was even a special Rest Day.) So they asked Pilate to command for their legs to be broken \add to hasten their deaths\add* and then they could be removed \add sooner\add*.
\v 32 So the soldiers¦80737 came¦80733 and broke the legs of the men on each side of Jesus,
\v 33 but when they got to him, they saw¦80757 that he was already dead so they didn't break his legs.
\v 34 Instead one of the soldiers¦80772 stabbed his side with a spear and immediately¦80782 blood¦80783 and water¦80785 came¦80781 out.
\v 35 The one who actually saw this happen\f + \fr 9:35 \ft Believed to be the author of this account.\f* has testified this and his account is accurate so that you \add readers\add* can also believe it.
\v 36 Because these things¦80812 also happened to fulfil what was written in the scriptures,\x + \xo 19:36: \xt Exo 12:46; Num 9:12; Psa 34:20.\x* that “none of his bones will be broken,”
\v 37 and in another place,\x + \xo 19:37: \xt Zech 12:10; Rev 1:7.\x* “they will look at the one that they pierced.”
\s1 The wrapping and laying of Jesus' body
\r (Mat. 27:57-61; Mrk. 15:42-47; Luk. 23:50-56)
\p
\v 38 After all of this, Joseph from Arimathea went to Pilate. (Joseph was a follower of Jesus, but secretly because he was afraid of what the Jewish leaders might do.) He asked Pilate for permission to remove Jesus' body, and it was granted to him. So they went and got his body.
\v 39 \x + \xo 19:39: \xt Jn 3:1-2.\x*Nicodemus (the one who had first visited Jesus¦80879 at night) also came, bringing around 30kg of burial spices.
\v 40 So they took¦80901 Jesus' body¦80904 and wrapped it around with linen strips with the spices as per the Jewish burial customs.
\v 41 There was a garden out at the place¦80928 where Jesus had been executed, and¦80932 in the garden there was a new tomb¦80936 that hadn't been used yet.
\v 42 So because it was the preparation day¦80950 and because the tomb¦80957 was nearby, they¦80959 laid his body there.
\c 20
\s1 The body is missing from the chamber
\r (Mat. 28:1-8; Mrk. 16:1-8; Luk. 24:1-12)
\p
\v 1 The following Sunday, Mary from Magdala went out to the tomb very early when it was still dark, and¦80980 she saw that the stone¦80983 had been removed from the entrance.
\v 2 So she ran quickly and went to Simon Peter and the other intern that Jesus loved, and told them, “They've taken the master's body out of the tomb¦81016 and we don't know where they've put him.”
\p
\v 3 So Peter¦81026 and the other intern went out to the tomb.
\v 4 They were running¦81037 together, but the other intern was a bit faster than Peter¦81051 and so he came¦81053 to the tomb¦81058 first.
\v 5 Without going in, he stooped down at the entrance and looked in and saw the linen strips lying there.
\v 6 But Peter came¦81081 along behind him¦81079 and went straight into the tomb¦81084 and also saw the linen strips lying there.
\v 7 But the piece of cloth that had been on the head wasn't lying there with the linen strips, but¦81104 had been folded and¦81090 placed separately.
\v 8 So now the other intern who had arrived first also went inside and he saw¦81124 it all and believed \add that Jesus had risen\add*.
\v 9 (At that time they¦81129 weren't yet aware of the scripture about him¦81135 coming back to life.)
\v 10 So they¦81139 went¦81139 back again to their homes.
\s1 Jesus reveals himself to Mary from Magdala
\r (Mat. 28:9-10; Mrk. 16:9-11)
\p
\v 11 But Mary had stayed there outside the tomb weeping. But when she stooped down and looked into the tomb,
\v 12 she saw two¦81169 angels¦81170 dressed in white sitting there—one at the head end and one at the feet¦81183 end of the slab where Jesus'¦81189 body¦81187 had been lying.
\v 13 They spoke to her, “Woman, why are you¦81196 crying?”
\p “Because they've taken away my master,” she replied, “and I don't know where they've put him.”
\p
\v 14 Then she turned¦81218 back around and saw Jesus standing there, but she didn't realise who it was.
\v 15 Jesus asked her, “Woman, why are you crying? Who are you looking for?”
\p Mary assumed he might be the gardener, so she answered, “Mister, if you took him, tell me where you put him and I'll take him away \add for you\add*.”
\p
\v 16 Jesus just answered, “Mary.”
\p She spun around and said, “My teacher!” (‘Rabboni’ in Hebrew.)
\p
\v 17 And Jesus said to her, “Don't touch me because I haven't gone back up to the father yet, but go and tell my brothers¦81312 that I'm going up to my father and the father of you all, and my god and the god of you all.”
\p
\v 18 So Mary went and told the trainees, “I've seen¦81344 the master,” and she told them what he'd said.
\s1 Jesus appears to his followers
\r (Mat. 28:16-20; Mrk. 16:14-18; Luk. 24:36-49)
\p
\v 19 On Sunday evening Jesus' trainees had met together and had the doors¦81368 locked because they were afraid of the Jewish leaders, but Jesus arrived and stood in the middle of the room and said, “Peace to you¦81392 all.”
\v 20 Then he showed them his hands¦81401 and his side and they were so happy now that they had seen¦81412 the master.
\v 21 Jesus continued, “Peace to you all. Now I am sending¦81430 you all out just like the father¦81428 sent¦81425 me out.”
\v 22 Then he breathed on them and said, “Receive the pure spirit.
\v 23 \x + \xo 20:23: \xt Mat 16:19; 18:18.\x*If you forgive anyone's sins¦81451, then they'll be forgiven. If you withhold forgiveness, then it will be withheld.”
\s1 Thomas sees the evidence for himself
\p
\v 24 But Thomas, one of the twelve¦81471 (nicknamed ‘Twin’), wasn't with them when Jesus had come.
\v 25 So the other trainees told him, “We have seen¦81491 the master.”
\p But he replied, “I won't believe that unless I see¦81500 the mark of the nails in his hands¦81506 and I can put my finger¦81529 into the marks and can put my hand into his side.”
\p
\v 26 Eight days¦81558 later, Jesus' trainees were again together inside, and Thomas was with them.
\v 27 Jesus came and stood in the middle of the room even though the doors were shut, and said, “Peace to you all.”
\p
\v 28 Thomas spoke up, “My master and my god!”
\p
\v 29 “So you believe now because you've seen me,” said Jesus. “The ones who haven't seen me, yet who believe anyway, will be receive a reward.”
\s1 Why this document was written
\p
\v 30 Jesus went on to do many other miracles in front of his trainees which aren't recorded in this account.
\v 31 But what has been written here has been recorded so that you all might believe that Jesus is the messiah, God's son, and then by believing, so that you might have \add true\add* life¦81698 through his power.
\c 21
\s1 The miracle of the net full of fish
\p
\v 1 After all this, Jesus revealed himself again to his trainees at Lake Galilee. It happened like this:
\v 2 Simon Peter, Thomas nicknamed ‘Twin’, Nathanael from Cana in Galilee, the sons¦81746 of Zebedee, and two¦81759 other trainees had gathered together
\v 3 \x + \xo 21:3: \xt Luk 5:5.\x*when Simon Peter said that he was going¦81765 fishing and the others said that they'd join him.
\p So they went off and boarded the boat¦81783, but they didn't catch anything that night.
\p
\v 4 When the dawn was approaching, Jesus was standing there on the shore, but they didn't know that it¦81815 was him.
\v 5 Jesus called out, “Hey, young fellas. Don't you have any fish¦81826?”
\p “None.” they answered.
\p
\v 6 \x + \xo 21:6: \xt Luk 5:6.\x*Then he said, “Throw the net out over the right side of the boat¦81842 and you'll find some.” So they did it and they caught so many fish that the net was too heavy to pull back in.
\p
\v 7 Now the intern that Jesus loved said to Peter, “It's the master!” When Simon Peter heard that, he put on his robe (because he didn't have it on), and jumped overboard into the lake.
\v 8 The other trainees followed in the little boat¦81934 dragging the net¦81953 behind them because they¦81940 were only about 100m out from the shore.
\v 9 When they went up the beach, they saw some bread¦81970 there and a charcoal fire¦81964 with fish¦81967 cooking on it
\v 10 and Jesus told them, “Bring some of the fish¦81979 that you¦81981 just caught.”
\p
\v 11 So Simon Peter went and dragged the net onto the beach. Amazingly it hadn't torn even though it contained 153 large fish.
\v 12 Then Jesus said, “Now, come and have breakfast.” But none of the trainees dared to ask who he was, because they figured it must be the master.
\v 13 Jesus brought the bread¦82042 to them and shared it around, and then likewise for the fish¦82050.
\p
\v 14 This was now the third time¦82055 that Jesus¦82058 had appeared to his trainees since he'd come back to life.
\s1 Jesus questions Peter
\p
\v 15 While they were eating, Jesus asked Simon Peter, “Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these?”
\p Peter answered, “Yes, master, you know that I love you.”
\p Jesus responded, “Feed my lambs.”
\v 16 Then he asked again, “Simon, son of John, do you love me?”
\p Peter replied, “Yes, master, you know that I love you.”
\p Jesus responded, “Shepherd my sheep¦82131.”
\v 17 Then he asked a third time, “Simon, son of John, do you love me?”
\p Peter was now upset that he had been asked a third time if he loved him, and he answered, “Master, you know everything.”
\p Jesus responded, “Feed my sheep¦82178.
\v 18 I can assure you that when you were younger, you dressed yourself and went wherever you wanted to go, but as you age, you'll be stretching out your hands¦82201 and others will dress you and will take you where you don't want to go.”
\v 19 When he said this, Jesus was indicating how Peter would die honouring God, and he told Peter, “Keep following¦82241 me.”
\p
\v 20 \x + \xo 21:20: \xt Jn 13:25.\x*When Peter turned¦82243 around he saw that the intern that Jesus loved was following¦82254 them—the one who had leaned on Jesus' chest¦82263 during the supper and asked who the one was who would turn Jesus over.
\v 21 Noticing him, Peter asked Jesus, “Master, what about that one?”
\p
\v 22 But Jesus replied, “If I want him to stay alive until I come back, what business would it¦82303 be of yours? You just stay following¦82309 me.”
\p
\v 23 As a result of that, a rumour went around the others that that one would not die, but Jesus never said that. (He only said, “If I want him to stay alive until I come back, what business would it be of yours?”)
\s1 Statement of fact
\p
\v 24 This author is the intern that testifies about these things—the one who wrote this down and whose account is true.
\v 25 (There were also many other things¦82378 that Jesus did, which if they were all written down then even the world itself¦82392 wouldn't have room for all the books that would need to be written.)
