\mt2 The account of Yeshua's ministry by
\mt1 Yohan
\is1 Introduction
\is2 Author
\ip This account about the works and teachings of Yeshua (Jesus) was written by Yohan, brother of Yacob (mistakenly known in older English Bibles as James). Both of them were in the small group of twelve close followers of Yeshua that he selected as his apprentices and who accompanied him around as he taught. Out of the twelve, Yohan was the one that greatly loved Yeshua, and his closeness gave him much of the insight that he includes with his description of Yeshua's actions and teaching. The two brothers were the sons of Zebedee, and all three of them worked on Lake Galilee as fishermen.
\is2 This account
\ip The \em Open English Translation\em* places Yohan's account before the others because it begins with the eternal existence of Yeshua the messiah. Not only is Yeshua the godly messenger, he was also the creator who has now descended from heaven as a man. Omitting any mention of the baby Yeshua, Yohan does however tell us about Yohan-the-Immerser who came before Yeshua to prepare the people for the arrival of the promised messiah.
\ip In chapters two to twelve it's written how the various miracles that Yeshua did showed that he was the promised messiah who would offer life without ending to anyone who would accept that he had been sent by God and trust in his teaching. Although there were indeed many who did believe in him, many others were unable to come to that point and ended up opposing Yeshua at every turn.
\ip In chapters thirteen to seventeen, the compassion of Yeshua towards his followers is described. He also told them in advance of his impending brutal death.
\ip In the final few chapters, we read about the arrest and judging of Yeshua, his being fastened to a pole and giving up his spirit, his coming back to life, and how his followers saw him and spoke with him again during that period.
\ip Yohan is careful to explain how to receive life without ending by means of believing that Yeshua came down from heaven and obeying his teaching. Yeshua himself is the path and the truth and the life (14:6).

\v 1 In the beginning¦62913 was the message,\f + \fr 1:1 \ft TD: This passage is complex to translate because the message was also the messenger—that is, Yeshua came not only to teach about getting saved, but also to become the actual way to be saved!\f* and the message was with God, and the message was \add and is\add* God.
\v 2 The message was with \nd God¦62936\nd* even at the creation¦62933 \add of the universe\add*.
\v 3 Everything came into existence through¦62938 the messenger\f + \fr 1:3 \ft Lit. him.\f*—not even one thing¦62947 came into existence apart from him.
\v 4 He holds life, and that life is the light¦62961 of humankind.
\v 5 And that light¦62966 is shining¦62970 in the darkness, and darkness cannot overcome him.
\p
\v 6 \x + \xo 1:6: \xt Mat 3:1; Mrk 1:4; Luk 3:1-2.\x*A man¦62978 arrived who had been sent¦62979 by \nd God¦62983\nd*. His name¦62986 was Yohan¦62988.
\v 7 He came as a testimony¦62994 to tell about the light so that everyone would believe¦63002 the light.
\v 8 Yohan himself wasn't the light—he was merely the announcer of the light.
\v 9 The true light¦63019 which¦63022 enlightens¦63023 every¦63024 person¦63025 was coming¦63026 into the world¦63029.
\p
\v 10 He was in the world and he's the creator of the world, and yet the world didn't even know him.
\v 11 He came¦63051 to his own chosen people, but they wouldn't accept him¦63055,
\v 12 however anyone who would accept him and trusted in his¦63076 authority, he gave¦63063 them the right¦63067 to become¦63070 children¦63068 of \nd God¦63069\nd*—
\v 13 not physical children and not coming from human actions, but¦63089 children of \nd God¦63091\nd*.
\p
\v 14 And the message¦63096 became¦63098 a human and lived here among¦63101 us and we¦63104 saw¦63104 his¦63107 greatness—the greatness of an only child of the father¦63112—full of grace¦63115 and truth¦63117.
\p
\v 15 Yohan¦63118 explained about him and loudly told everyone, “This is the one I meant when I said¦63129, ‘There's someone coming¦63135 after¦63133 me, yet who came before me, because¦63140 he existed before I did!’ ”
\p
\v 16 Because¦63144 he has so much, we all received¦63153 grace and then even more grace.
\v 17 The commandments came to us through Moses, but grace¦63167 and truth¦63170 came to us through \nd Yeshua¦63172\nd* the \nd messiah¦63173\nd*.
\v 18 No one has ever actually seen¦63177 God, but the human son born from God the father¦63192 and in close touch with him, he was the one to explain¦63194 God to us.

\v 19 Yohan¦63202 explained some of this when the Jewish leaders sent¦63204 out priests¦63212 and¦63213 temple workers from Yerusalem¦63211 to ask¦63218 him¦63221, “Who are you¦63223?”
\p
\v 20 He didn't flinch from the truth and so he told them, “I am not the \nd chosen¦63239\nd* \nd messiah¦63239\nd*.”
\p
\v 21 \x + \xo 1:21: a \xt Mal 4:5; \xo b \xt Deu 18:15,18.\x*So they asked him again, “Are you Eliyah come back to life?”
\p And he answered, “No, I'm not.”
\p They asked, “Are you the prophet¦63262?”
\p Again he answered, “No, I'm not.”
\p
\v 22 So they asked him¦63271, “Who are you then? We need to give¦63277 an answer¦63276 to the ones who sent¦63279 us. How do you describe yourself¦63285?”
\p
\v 23 \x + \xo 1:23: \xt Isa 40:3 (LXX).\x*So he said, “I am a voice¦63288 shouting¦63289\f + \fr 1:23 \ft We've deliberately omitted putting a comma here, because it's also possible that the comma should go after ‘wilderness’.\f* in the wilderness smooth the path¦63295 of the \nd master¦63296\nd*, as the prophet¦63306 Isayah said.”
\p
\v 24 Some of the ones sent¦63309 out were members of the Pharisee¦63313 party¦63313.
\v 25 These ones asked¦63315 Yohan, “So why are you immersing¦63323 people then if you aren't the \nd messiah¦63329\nd* or Eliyah or the prophet¦63336?”
\p
\v 26 He answered¦63337, “I'm immersing¦63343 people in water¦63347, but somewhere here among us all there's someone you don't¦63357 know—
\v 27 the one coming¦63364 after¦63362 me, and I'm not even good enough to untie¦63377 his¦63378 sandal¦63382 straps¦63380!”
\p
\v 28 All this happened in Bethany¦63387 on the east side of the Yordan¦63392 River where¦63394 Yohan¦63397 was immersing¦63398 people.

\v 29 The next day¦63401 Yohan saw \nd Yeshua¦63407\nd* coming¦63408 towards him¦63410, and¦63411 said, “Hey! Here's the sacrificial lamb of \nd God¦63417\nd* who's come to take away the sin¦63422 of the world¦63425.
\v 30 This is the man¦63438 I was talking about when I said¦63432, ‘There's someone coming¦63437 after me, yet who came before me, because¦63443 he¦63446 existed before I did.’
\v 31 I didn't know who he¦63454 was but¦63451 nevertheless I came¦63459 and immersed¦63464 people in water¦63463 so that this man could be revealed¦63453 to \add all\add* Israel.”
\p
\v 32 And Yohan¦63468 further explained, “I saw God's \nd spirit¦63473\nd* come down and¦63482 settle on him¦63486.
\v 33 I didn't know which one was him, but the one who sent me to immerse people in water¦63500 said, ‘When you see the spirit coming¦63512 down and settling on someone, he is the one who will immerse people with God's holy spirit.’
\v 34 And I have seen¦63529 that, and so I can assure you that he is God's son.”

\v 35 The next day¦63541, Yohan¦63546 was back there with two¦63552 of his¦63551 apprentices¦63550
\v 36 and noticing \nd Yeshua¦63556\nd* walking¦63557 nearby he said, “Look! There's the \add sacrificial\add* lamb of \nd God¦63563\nd*.”
\p
\v 37 \nd When¦63586\nd* his¦63578 two¦63577 apprentices¦63579 heard¦63573 him say that, they left him and followed¦63584 \nd Yeshua¦63586\nd*.
\v 38 But \nd Yeshua¦63590\nd* turned¦63587 and saw them following¦63594 him, and asked them, “\wj What do you two want?\wj*”
\p And they said¦63602 to him, “Teacher¦63610, where do you live?”
\p
\v 39 “\wj Come and see,\wj*” Yeshua replied. So they went with him and saw¦63623 where¦63625 he lived, and then they stayed there that night, because it was already late afternoon.
\p
\v 40 Andrew¦63642, the brother¦63644 of Simon¦63645 Peter was one of those two¦63651 who heard¦63653 Yohan¦63655 and¦63656 then followed¦63657 Yeshua.
\v 41 As soon as he found his brother¦63665, he said to Simon¦63668, “We have found the messiah—God's chosen one,”
\v 42 and led him to Yeshua. When Yeshua saw him, he said¦63693, “\wj Ah, you are Simon¦63697, Yohan's son, but from now on you'll be called¦63703 Peter which¦63705 means \it stone\it*.\wj*”

\v 43 The following¦63726 day¦63709, \nd Yeshua¦63725\nd* wanted¦63711 to go to Galilee¦63717. He found Philip and¦63721 told him¦63723, “\wj Follow me!\wj*”
\v 44 Philip was from the town of Bethsaida where Andrew¦63739 and¦63740 Peter lived.
\v 45 Philip then found Nathanael¦63745 and told him¦63748, “We've¦63758 found the one that Moses and the prophets¦63757 wrote¦63750 about in the Scriptures. He's \nd Yeshua¦63759\nd* from Nazareth¦63768.”
\p
\v 46 And Nathanael¦63772 said¦63770, “Does anything good¦63777 come from Nazareth¦63774?”
\p So Philip answered, “Well, come and¦63785 see¦63786 \add for yourself\add*.”
\p
\v 47 \nd Yeshua¦63791\nd* saw¦63787 Nathanael¦63793 approaching and¦63797 said, “\wj Ah, this is an honest Israeli¦63805.\wj*”
\p
\v 48 But Nathanael¦63814 queried him, “Where do you know \em me\em* from?”
\p And \nd Yeshua¦63821\nd* replied, “\wj Actually I saw¦63834 you under¦63831 that fig¦63833 tree¦63833 before Philip had even called you.\wj*”
\p
\v 49 Nathanael¦63838 exclaimed, “Great teacher! You \em are\em* God's son! You're the king¦63854 of Israel!”
\p
\v 50 \nd Yeshua¦63860\nd* responded, “\wj So you believe¦63876 this because I said that I had seen you under the fig¦63874 tree¦63874. You'll get to see much greater¦63877 things¦63880 than that!\wj*”

\v 1 On the Tuesday\f + \fr 2:1 \ft Or possibly, ‘Three days later’.\f*, there was a wedding¦63916 in Cana in Galilee¦63923, and¦63924 \nd Yeshua's¦63929\nd* mother¦63927 was there
\v 2 and \nd Yeshua¦63935\nd* and his¦63940 apprentices¦63939 were also invited¦63931.
\v 3 When the wine ran out at the wedding, his mother¦63960 said to him¦63965, “They haven't got any more wine.”
\p
\v 4 \nd Yeshua¦63975\nd* answered, “\wj What does that have to do with us, mother? It's not the time for my¦63986 ministry yet.\wj*”
\p
\v 5 But his¦63990 mother¦63989 told the servants¦63992, “Just do whatever¦63993 he tells you.”
\p
\v 6 Now there were six¦64007 empty stone¦64005 water¦64006 jars there that are used for Jewish purification¦64011 ceremonies. (Each one could hold over 70 litres.)
\v 7 So \nd Yeshua¦64028\nd* told them to fill the jars with water¦64032, and they¦64034 filled¦64034 them up.
\v 8 Then he said, “\wj Ok, now take a sample out and give it to the MC.\wj*” So they took some
\v 9 and when the MC tasted¦64053 the water that had now turned to wine, not knowing¦64062 where¦64063 it had come from he called the groom
\v 10 and exclaimed, “Most people supply the best wine at the beginning \add of the reception\add*, and the cheaper stuff when people are a bit tipsy. But you've kept¦64098 the best wine until¦64102 last!”
\p
\v 11 This event in Cana, Galilee¦64118, was the first of the miracles that \nd Yeshua¦64113\nd* did, and it revealed¦64121 his greatness and his followers¦64131 believed¦64126 that he was from God.

\v 13 \x + \xo 2:13: \xt Exo 12:1-27.\x*By then it was getting close to the time of the Jewish Feast of the Passover, and¦64173 \nd Yeshua¦64180\nd* went¦64174 down to Yerusalem¦64178.
\v 14 There in the temple¦64185, he discovered merchants selling¦64187 cows and sheep¦64192 and doves¦64196, and moneychangers¦64200 sitting¦64201 at their tables.
\v 15 Yeshua formed some cords¦64208 into a whip and drove the sheep¦64219 and cows out of the temple¦64214 grounds, and he overturned¦64235 the tables¦64233—spilling the coins¦64230 of the moneychangers¦64225 onto the ground.
\v 16 He scolded the ones selling¦64242 doves¦64241, saying, “\wj Get them out of here! Don't be making¦64249 my¦64254 father's¦64253 house into a market.\wj*”
\v 17 \x + \xo 2:17: \xt Psa 69:9.\x*That reminded¦64259 his¦64263 followers¦64262 of the scripture: “I'll be filled with zeal for your¦64274 temple.”
\p
\v 18 Then the Jewish leaders responded, “Do a miracle to show that you have the authority to do these¦64291 things¦64291.”
\p
\v 19 \x + \xo 2:19: \xt Mat 26:61; 27:40; Mrk 14:58; 15:29.\x*But \nd Yeshua¦64295\nd* answered¦64293, “\wj Well, destroy this temple¦64301 and I'll raise\f + \fr 2:19 \ft We couldn't easily use \em rebuild\em* here because there's a play on words—see verse 21.\f* it¦64308 again in three¦64305 days¦64306.\wj*”
\p

\p
\v 21 But Yeshua had been meaning his¦64341 own body¦64340 when he was talking¦64335 about the temple¦64338.
\v 22 In the future when he was actually raised¦64345 from the dead¦64347, his¦64351 followers¦64350 remembered this statement, and they believed¦64358 both the \add Hebrew\add* scriptures¦64360 and \nd Yeshua's¦64368\nd* message¦64363.

\v 1 One night a Jewish leader named Nicodemus who was a member of the Pharisee¦64436 party¦64436
\v 2 came¦64445 to Yeshua and said¦64453, “Teacher, we know that God has sent you as a teacher¦64461, because¦64464 no one could do these¦64466 kinds of miracles if God wasn't with him.”
\p
\v 3 \nd Yeshua¦64485\nd* responded, “\wj I'll tell you frankly that no one can enter God's kingdom¦64503 unless he is reborn.\wj*”
\p
\v 4 Nicodemus questioned, “How can an adult be reborn? A person¦64513 can't just return to their mother's¦64526 womb and¦64530 then get born a second¦64528 time!”
\p
\v 5 But \nd Yeshua¦64535\nd* continued, “\wj Honestly, I'm telling¦64538 you¦64539: unless a person is born from both water¦64546 \em and¦64547\em* the \nd spirit¦64548\nd*, they can't enter God's kingdom¦64556.\wj*
\v 6 \wj Someone that's born from a body is flesh \add and bone\add*, but someone that's born from God's spirit is spiritual.\wj*

\p
\v 9 Nicodemus replied, “How can all this even happen?”
\p
\v 10 “\wj You're a Jewish teacher¦64637,\wj*” \nd Yeshua¦64630\nd* answered¦64628, “\wj and yet you¦64643 don't¦64642 know all this?\wj*
\v 11 \wj It's true that we just teach what we know, and explain what we've seen¦64655 ourselves, but you people aren't accepting our¦64660 testimony¦64659.\wj*

\v 13 \wj None of you have gone up into heaven, but I, humanity's child, have come down from heaven.\wj*

\v 16 \wj Because¦64744 in that same way, \nd God¦64747\nd* loves the people of the world enough to cause his only son to be born and to give him¦64764 to the world, so that everyone¦64759 who believes¦64761 this will not die, but¦64768 will live forever.\wj*

\v 19 \wj And this is the verdict: that light has come into the world¦64829, but some people¦64834 love the darkness¦64838 more than the light because¦64844 they do evil things,\wj*

\v 23 Yohan¦64924 was also immersing¦64925 people at Aenon near Salim because¦64932 there was plenty of water¦64933 there and people would come \add to him\add* to get immersed¦64940.
\v 24 \x + \xo 3:24: \xt Mat 14:3; Mrk 6:17; Luk 3:19-20.\x*(At this point in time, Yohan¦64949 had not yet been put in prison¦64947.)

\v 26 So some people went to Yohan¦64971 and said¦64973, “Teacher, that man that came¦64968 to you across the river and that you testified¦64987 about, now \em he's\em* immersing¦64991 people and so they're all going to him.”
\p
\v 27 “None¦65003 of us get anything if it's not being given¦65015 from heaven¦65019,” Yohan¦64998 answered¦64997.

\v 29 It's the groom that has the bride¦65043—the best man is happy because¦65060 he sees that the groom is happy. So I'm actually completely happy with all this.

\p
\v 1 \nd When¦65210\nd* \nd Yeshua¦65210\nd* found out that the Pharisee¦65208 party¦65208 knew¦65201 that he was gaining and immersing¦65215 more followers¦65212 than Yohan¦65217 had,
\v 2 (although actually it wasn't \nd Yeshua¦65220\nd* himself¦65221 that was immersing¦65224 them, but¦65225 his¦65228 trainees that were doing it),
\v 3 he left Yudea¦65231 and went¦65234 back up to Galilee¦65238.
\v 4 On the way up, he¦65244 decided to go through Samaria¦65245.
\p
\v 5 \x + \xo 4:5: \xt Gen 33:19; Josh 24:32.\x*By choosing that route, they came to a town in Samaria¦65251 called¦65252 Sukar, which¦65257 was near the place that the \add patriarch\add* Yosef had inherited from his¦65265 father Yacob¦65260,
\v 6 and Yacob's¦65271 well was there¦65268. \nd Yeshua¦65274\nd* was tired from all the walking and was sitting¦65280 by the well around midday.
\p
\v 7 A woman¦65296 came from the town to get water¦65301 from the well, and \nd Yeshua¦65305\nd* asked her¦65303 for a drink¦65308
\v 8 since his¦65313 followers¦65312 had gone into the town to buy some lunch.
\p
\v 9 \x + \xo 4:9: \xt Ist 4:1-5; Neh 4:1-2.\x*The woman said to him, “You're a Jew¦65330. How come you're asking me for a drink¦65336 when I'm from Samaria?” (Jews¦65348 don't¦65345 normally associate¦65347 with anyone from Samaria.)
\p
\v 10 \nd Yeshua¦65353\nd* answered¦65351, “\wj If you had recognised God's gift¦65360 and who it is who's asking you for a drink, you would have asked me and I would have given you \em living¦65382\em* water¦65381 \add to drink\add*.\wj*”
\p
\v 11 But the woman¦65388 countered, “Mister¦65389, you don't even have \add rope and\add* a bucket¦65392 to reach the water in the deep well. How then could you get ‘living¦65412 water’?
\v 12 I doubt that you're greater¦65415 than our¦65420 ancestor Yacob¦65421 who made this well for us and drank¦65436 this water along with his children and his animals.”
\p
\v 13 \nd Yeshua¦65447\nd* responded, “\wj Everyone¦65452 who drinks¦65454 this water¦65457 will get thirsty¦65459 again¦65460,\wj*
\v 14 \wj but whoever¦65461 drinks¦65466 the water that I give them will find a well springing up inside them—springing into eternal¦65499 life¦65498.\wj*”
\p
\v 15 So the woman¦65504 said, “Ok, then. Give me some of that water¦65510 so that I won't get thirsty¦65513 and won't have to keep coming out here to the well.”
\p
\v 16 Yeshua said, “\wj First, go and get your¦65533 husband¦65532 and return here.\wj*”
\p
\v 17 “I don't have a husband!” she retorted.
\p “\wj True enough—indeed you don't,\wj*” \nd Yeshua¦65551\nd* said.
\v 18 “\wj You've had five¦65560 husbands¦65562 and you're not married to the man you're living with, so that was true.\wj*”
\p
\v 19 “Mister¦65581, I can see that you're¦65586 a prophet¦65584,” the woman¦65580 reacted.
\v 20 “Our¦65589 ancestors¦65588 worshipped on this mountain¦65593, but you¦65597 Jews claim that people should only worship there in Yerusalem¦65601.”
\p
\v 21 Then \nd Yeshua¦65612\nd* told her, “\wj You need to believe¦65614 that I was sent from God, woman¦65617, because¦65618 a day is coming¦65619 when everyone will be worshipping¦65634 him neither¦65623 on this mountain¦65627, nor in Yerusalem¦65633.\wj*
\v 22 \wj You people in Samaria don't¦65640 even know who you¦65641 worship, but we do, because¦65646 people will be saved by means of us Jews¦65651.\wj*
\v 23 \wj But a time is coming¦65654, starting even now, when the true worshippers will be worshipping the father in spirit¦65667 and truth¦65669, because¦65671 those are the ones that he is wanting to worship him.\wj*
\v 24 \wj \nd God¦65685\nd* is spirit, and the ones worshipping him must worship in spirit and total honesty.\wj*”
\p
\v 25 The woman¦65702 said, “I'm aware that the messiah is coming¦65707—the chosen one of God. Whenever he appears, he'll teach us everything.”
\p
\v 26 “\wj \em I am\em* the messiah,\wj*” \nd Yeshua¦65722\nd* responded. “\wj Yes, he's speaking¦65726 to you¦65727!\wj*”
\rem /s1 The Disciples Rejoin Jesus
\p
\v 27 After this, his¦65737 followers¦65736 arrived back, and they were astounded that he was speaking with a woman¦65743. However no one dared ask her, “What are you after¦65729?” Or to ask him, “Why are you talking¦65744 with her?”
\p
\v 28 So the woman¦65768 left her¦65765 water¦65764 jar there, and went¦65770 back into the town where she told the people¦65777,
\v 29 “Come and see¦65779 a man¦65780 who knew as much about me as I know myself! He must be the \nd messiah¦65793\nd*!”
\v 30 So they¦65801 went out from the town to go and¦65800 see Yeshua.
\p
\v 31 Meanwhile, Yeshua's followers¦65814 encouraged him, “Teacher, here, eat.”
\p
\v 32 But he¦65819 said¦65821, “\wj I've had food to eat¦65826 that you¦65828 don't¦65829 know about.\wj*”
\p
\v 33 This made his followers¦65838 ask each other, “Did you see anyone¦65842 bring him¦65844 something¦65844 to eat¦65845?”
\p
\v 34 “\wj Obeying God who sent¦65859 me is like food to me, and¦65861 I plan to finish his¦65863 work,\wj*” \nd Yeshua¦65849\nd* explained.
\v 35 “\wj Don't you all have a saying about needing to wait four months¦65871 for a harvest? But I'm telling you that you all should open your¦65885 eyes¦65884 and look at the fields¦65889, because¦65890 they're already¦65895 lightening up as harvest time approaches.\wj*
\v 36 \wj The harvester gets paid with a harvest that will last forever so that the ones who plant and the ones who harvest can all celebrate.\wj*
\v 37 \wj There's truth in the statement¦65925 that one person plants and¦65934 a different person harvests.\wj*

\rem /s1 Many Samaritans Believe
\p
\v 39 And many people of Samaria¦65968 came out of that town and believed¦65964 that Yeshua is God because¦65969 the woman¦65973 had told them that he knew everything about her.
\v 40 So¦65990 when they all came¦65986, they asked him to stay in their town and they stayed on there¦66003 for a couple of days¦66005.
\p
\v 41 As a result of his¦66015 teaching, many more believed¦66011
\v 42 so then they told the woman, “We no longer¦66026 believe¦66033 just because of what you said, but now that we've heard¦66037 him for ourselves¦66034, we can see that he really is the saviour¦66049 of the world¦66051.”

\v 44 \x + \xo 4:44: \xt Mat 13:57; Mrk 6:4; Luk 4:24.\x*\nd He¦66069\nd* himself¦66066 had told them that no prophet¦66072 gets honoured¦66077 in his own home town¦66076.
\v 45 \x + \xo 4:45: \xt Jn 2:23.\x*When he got to Galilee¦66086, the people accepted him, having¦66093 seen¦66093 everything that he'd done at the feast in Yerusalem¦66100 because¦66107 they had also been down there.
\rem /s1 Jesus Heals an Official's Son
\p
\v 46 \x + \xo 4:46: \xt Jn 2:1-11.\x*So he went again¦66120 to Cana there in Galilee¦66131 where¦66132 he had made the water¦66136 into wine. Now there was a royal¦66143 official¦66143 there, whose¦66144 son in Capernaum¦66149 was ill.
\v 47 When the official heard¦66151 that \nd Yeshua¦66154\nd* was coming¦66155 up from Yudea to Galilee¦66162, he went¦66163 and asked him if he would come¦66172 and heal¦66175 his¦66176 son who was dying¦66182.
\v 48 \nd Yeshua¦66186\nd* said¦66183 to him¦66188, “\wj You people won't believe¦66198 unless you see¦66195 miracles and other marvels.\wj*”
\p
\v 49 But the official¦66204 begged him¦66201, “Sir, please come¦66207 before¦66208 my¦66215 child¦66212 dies.”
\p
\v 50 “\wj Go back there and see,\wj*” Yeshua responded. “\wj Your¦66223 son will recover.\wj*”
\p The man¦66228 believed¦66226 what Yeshua had told him, and so he started off.
\v 51 On his way, his slaves¦66248 met him and reported¦66255 that the boy¦66262 was alive and well.
\p
\v 52 So the official asked them what time it was that he got better¦66277, and they replied that the fever¦66293 had subsided around 1pm.
\v 53 The father¦66297 knew¦66294 that that was the time when Yeshua had told him that his son would recover, and as a result his whole¦66322 household¦66320 believed¦66316 \add that Yeshua came from God\add*.

\v 1 After¦66341 all this, there¦66343 was another Jewish feast¦66345, so \nd Yeshua¦66351\nd* went¦66349 down to Yerusalem¦66353.
\v 2 In Yerusalem¦66358 at the Sheep Gate, there's¦66354 the Bethsaida pool that has five¦66376 alcoves
\v 3 and a large number of sick, blind¦66388, lame, and paralysed¦66390 people¦66384 lie there in them.
\v 4 ≈
\v 5 One man¦66433 had been there¦66434 for thirty-eight¦66437 years¦66440,
\v 6 and when \nd Yeshua¦66450\nd* noticed him and knew that he'd been there for so long, he asked, “\wj Do you want to get better?\wj*”
\p
\v 7 “Yes mister,” the sick man answered¦66467, “but¦66492 when the water¦66481 starts moving, I don't¦66475 have a companion to lift me into the pool, so someone else always get there before¦66496 me.”
\p
\v 8 Then \nd Yeshua¦66503\nd* said, “\wj Stand up and pick up your¦66511 bedroll and start walking¦66513.\wj*”
\v 9 The man immediately¦66515 stood up, picked up his¦66530 gear, and started to walk¦66532.
\p However, this was the weekly rest day.
\v 10 \x + \xo 5:10: \xt Neh 13:19; Jer 17:21.\x*So the religious leaders said to the man, “Hey! It's against the law for you to carry your¦66559 bedding¦66557 on the rest day¦66548!”
\p
\v 11 But the man answered¦66563, “The person who made me better told me to pick up my bedroll and¦66582 start walking¦66583.”
\p
\v 12 “Oh. Who was it that told you¦66594 to take that stuff and¦66600 start walking¦66601?”
\p
\v 13 \nd But¦66615\nd* the man who had been healed¦66605 didn't even know who it was, because¦66613 \nd Yeshua¦66615\nd* had quickly left when a crowd¦66618 had formed.
\p
\v 14 Later on, \nd Yeshua¦66630\nd* found the man in the temple¦66635 and told him, “\wj Look, you're better now so don't go on sinning¦66644, because you don't want anything worse¦66647 to happen to you.\wj*”
\p

\v 16 As a result, the leaders started harassing \nd Yeshua¦66686\nd* because he had done this on a rest day¦66698.
\v 17 But Yeshua just replied, “\wj My¦66708 father¦66707 is working today, and¦66712 so I'm also working.\wj*”
\p
\v 18 Because of this, the leaders became determined that he must be put to death—not just because he broke the rules for the rest day¦66731, but most of all because he was calling¦66736 God his own father¦66734, thus making¦66742 himself¦66741 equal¦66740 to God!

\p
\v 19 So \nd Yeshua¦66749\nd* responded to them, “\wj I want to tell you all something: The son can't initiate anything¦66781 by himself¦66772. He can only do what he sees his father doing, because¦66789 whatever¦66788 his father is doing, he also does things¦66796 like that.\wj*
\v 20 \wj You see, the father¦66805 loves his son and shows him everything that he's doing¦66818. In fact, he'll be showing him even greater¦66821 things than what he's done already, so that you all will be amazed¦66831.\wj*
\v 21 \wj Because¦66835 the father¦66837 brings the dead back to life, giving them new life, so too the son can give life to anyone who he wants.\wj*
\v 22 \wj The father¦66858 won't be judging¦66859 anyone, but¦66861 has already given¦66865 that task to the son,\wj*
\v 23 \wj so that the people might honour the son like they honour the father. But anyone who is not honouring the son, is also dishonouring the father who sent him.\wj*
\p
\v 24 “\wj I assure you that anyone who hears my¦66898 message¦66897 and believes¦66901 that I was sent by God, will live forever and will not be condemned, but has moved from death¦66919 into life.\wj*
\v 25 \wj I can also assure you¦66926 that a time is coming¦66928, and in fact is here already, when the dead¦66935 will be hearing¦66938 the voice of God's son and that voice will bring them back to life.\wj*
\v 26 \wj As the father¦66954 is the source of life, he gave the power of giving life to the son\wj*
\v 27 \wj and gave¦66977 him the authority¦66975 to be the final judge, because¦66983 he is humanity's child.\wj*
\v 28 \wj Don't be surprised at this, because¦66990 a time is coming¦66991 when everyone in their graves will be hearing¦67006 his¦67009 voice¦67008,\wj*

\p
\v 7 Philip answered¦67481, “To buy even just a snack for this many people would take several months' wages!”
\p
\v 8 Now one of Yeshua's apprentices¦67505, Simon¦67510 Peter's brother¦67509, Andrew¦67507, said to Yeshua,
\v 9 “There's a young boy¦67513 here with five¦67519 buns and¦67522 two¦67523 \add small¦67513 cooked\add* fish¦67524, but¦67525 that wouldn't even start to feed this crowd.”
\p
\v 10 But \nd Yeshua¦67536\nd* told them to get all the people¦67539 to sit¦67540 down as there¦67541 was a large grassy¦67544 area. So they all sat¦67550 down—some five¦67561 thousand¦67561 men¦67555 were counted.
\v 11 Then he took the buns and gave¦67571 thanks¦67571 to God, and started passing around both the buns and the fish¦67589, and everyone ate as much as they wanted.
\v 12 Once everyone was full, Yeshua got his¦67598 apprentices¦67597 to collect the left-over fragments¦67603 so as not to waste anything¦67606.
\v 13 So they gathered¦67610 the left-overs and filled¦67614 twelve¦67618 baskets¦67619 with left-over bread.
\p
\v 14 The people¦67634 who had witnessed this and other miracles said, “This really is the prophet¦67650 that God promised to send!”
\v 15 \nd But¦67657\nd* \nd Yeshua¦67657\nd* knew that they intended to come and grab him to proclaim him as their king¦67671, so he moved out of the crowd and on up the hill.

\p
\v 16 As it¦67686 moved into evening¦67685, Yeshua's apprentices¦67689 went back down to the lake¦67693
\v 17 and having¦67696 boarded¦67696 the boat¦67699, they¦67700 set out across¦67704 the lake¦67706 toward Capernaum¦67708. By then it was dark, and there was still no sign of \nd Yeshua¦67729\nd*.
\v 18 Then a strong wind¦67734 hit the lake¦67733 and the water got rough.
\v 19 \nd When¦67753\nd* they had rowed¦67739 about¦67743 five¦67748 kilometres, they saw \nd Yeshua¦67753\nd* walking¦67754 on top of the lake¦67758 and approaching the boat¦67763, and they were very scared.
\v 20 But he told them, “\wj Don't worry—it's me.\wj*”
\v 21 After that they were willing¦67777 to let him into the boat, and immediately¦67787 the boat was at their arrival place.

\p
\v 22 The next day, the crowd¦67805 looked across¦67809 the lake¦67811 and saw that only one small¦67816 boat had crossed, and they knew that only \nd Yeshua's¦67847\nd* apprentices had boarded that boat and left, and not Yeshua himself.
\v 23 Other boats¦67866 came¦67864 across from Tiberias¦67873 near the place¦67877 where¦67878 they¦67880 had eaten the bread¦67882 after the \nd master¦67885\nd* had given¦67883 thanks¦67883.
\v 24 So when all the people saw¦67889 that Yeshua wasn't around and his¦67904 apprentices¦67903 had left, they went off looking¦67921 for¦67921 Yeshua in Capernaum¦67920.

\rem /s1 Jesus the Bread of Life
\p
\v 25 When they found¦67926 him there across¦67928 the lake¦67930, they queried, “Teacher, how did you get here?”
\p
\v 26 “\wj Honestly, I know that you're looking¦67950 for¦67950 me, not because you saw¦67954 miracles,\wj*” \nd Yeshua¦67943\nd* answered¦67940, “\wj but because you all had plenty of food to fill you up.\wj*
\v 27 \wj Don't¦67986 \add just\add* work for the food which goes off, but¦67974 for the food which lasts forever—the food which humanity's child will give to you¦67988 because¦67991 \nd God¦67996\nd* the father¦67993 has put his mark of approval on him.\wj*”
\p
\v 28 Puzzled, they asked him¦68000, “What should we be doing if we want to work for \nd God¦68013\nd*?”
\p
\v 29 He answered, “\wj Doing God's work is putting your trust in the one that he sent¦68033 here.\wj*”
\p
\v 30 “If so,” they said¦68036, “what miracle will you do for us to see¦68049 so that we can believe¦68051 that you \add came from God\add*? What can \em you\em* do?
\v 31 \x + \xo 6:31: \xt Exo 16:4,15; Psa 78:24.\x*Our¦68057 ancestors¦68056 ate¦68060 the manna¦68059\f + \fr 6:31 \ft Manna was a word that meant ‘stuff’ and referred to some kind of flakes that regularly came down from the sky in the time of Moses and could be eaten as food.\f* out in the wilderness¦68063, just like Moses wrote, ‘He gave¦68072 them bread¦68068 from the sky to eat¦68075.’ ”
\p
\v 32 \nd Yeshua¦68080\nd* said to them, “\wj Actually I can tell you that it wasn't Moses who gave¦68087 them bread from heaven, but my¦68098 father¦68097 gives you the real bread from heaven,\wj*
\v 33 \wj because God's bread¦68111 is the one who came down from heaven¦68120 and¦68121 who gives life¦68122 to the world¦68127.\wj*”
\p
\v 34 So they¦68128 requested, “Mister¦68132, keep giving us that bread¦68138.”
\p
\v 35 “\wj \em I am\em* the bread¦68149 that gives life¦68151,\wj*” \nd Yeshua¦68145\nd* answered, “\wj anyone who comes to me will never hunger¦68159, and¦68162 the one believing¦68164 in me, will never be thirsty¦68169 again.\wj*
\v 36 \wj But as I said¦68174 already, although you have seen¦68178 me you refuse to believe¦68183 me.\wj*
\v 37 \wj Everyone¦68185 that the father¦68190 gives to me will come to me, and¦68194 I certainly won't turn away anyone who comes to me,\wj*
\v 38 \wj because I came¦68206 down from heaven¦68210, not to do what I want, but¦68219 to do what the one who sent¦68223 me wants.\wj*
\v 39 \wj And what he wants is for me to not lose anyone that he's given¦68238 to me, but to bring them back to life on the last day¦68254.\wj*
\v 40 \wj My¦68267 father¦68264 wants everyone¦68269 who watches me and believes¦68275 in me to live forever, because I will bring them back to life¦68281 on that final day¦68291.\wj*”
\p
\v 41 This little speech made the religious leaders grumble¦68292 about¦68297 him because¦68299 he had said¦68300 that he was the food that came down from heaven¦68309,
\v 42 as they figured out, “This is \nd Yeshua¦68318\nd* the son of Yosef and so we know his parents. So how can he say that he came¦68346 down from heaven¦68345?”
\p
\v 43 \nd Yeshua¦68351\nd* scolded them, “\wj Don't be grumbling¦68357 to each other.\wj*
\v 44 \wj No one can join me unless the father¦68369 who sent¦68372 me attracts them, and¦68378 then I'll be bringing them back to life on that final day¦68386.\wj*
\v 45 \x + \xo 6:45: \xt Isa 54:13.\x*\wj The prophets¦68391 wrote that the people will be taught¦68395 by \nd God¦68397\nd*. And everyone who's heard¦68402 and¦68406 learned¦68407 from the father¦68405 comes to me.\wj*
\v 46 \wj Not that any person has seen the father—only the one who came from \nd God¦68428\nd* has seen him.\wj*
\v 47 \wj I tell you¦68438 sincerely: the one who believes¦68441 \add in me\add* will live forever.\wj*
\v 48 \wj \em I am\em* the bread¦68450 that gives true life¦68452.\wj*
\v 49 \wj Your¦68455 ancestors¦68454 ate¦68456 manna¦68465 in the wilderness¦68463, but they¦68467 all went on to die.\wj*
\v 50 \wj But \em I am\em* the bread¦68471 that came down from heaven¦68475 and¦68485 anyone¦68480 who eats this will not die¦68488.\wj*
\v 51 \wj \em I am\em* the living bread that came down from heaven¦68499 and if anyone¦68503 eats this bread, he will live through to the next age.\wj*”
\p
\v 52 At this point, the religious leaders began to argue with each other, “How could this man give¦68554 us his¦68560 flesh¦68557 to eat¦68561?”
\p
\v 53 So \nd Yeshua¦68566\nd* explained, “\wj Indeed if you don't¦68573 eat¦68575 my flesh¦68577 and drink¦68584 my blood¦68588, you aren't truly¦68568 alive!\wj*
\v 54 \wj The person who eats my flesh¦68605 and drinks¦68608 my blood¦68612 will gain eternal¦68615 life—I will bring them back to life on that final day¦68624.\wj*
\v 55 \wj For my flesh¦68627 is the true food, and¦68633 my blood¦68635 is the true drink¦68640.\wj*
\v 56 \wj Anyone who eats my flesh¦68679 and drinks¦68681 my blood¦68685 lives in me, and I will live in him¦68691.\wj*
\v 57 \wj The father is alive and sent me here, and I am alive because of Him, so also the person who eats me will be alive because of me.\wj*
\v 58 \wj Unlike your ancestors¦68762 who ate that bread \add from the sky\add* and then died, anyone who eats this bread that came down from heaven¦68755 will live through to the next age.\wj*”
\s1 Many people find the teaching too difficult
\p
\v 59 Yeshua taught¦68787 all of this in the meeting¦68785 hall¦68785 there in Capernaum¦68789.
\rem /s1 Many Disciples Desert Jesus
\rem /s1 The Words of Eternal Life
\v 60 But even many of his¦68797 followers¦68796 who heard¦68793 it said¦68799, “This is difficult teaching—it's too hard to take.”
\p
\v 61 But \nd Yeshua¦68819\nd* already knew inside that his¦68830 followers¦68829 were grumbling¦68825 about¦68826 this and asked them, “\wj Do you¦68836 find this offensive¦68837?\wj*
\v 62 \wj What¦68847 if you were to see humanity's child ascending to where¦68850 he came from?\wj*
\v 63 \wj It's the spirit that is the source of life, not the body. The concepts that I've taught you are all spiritual and life-giving.\wj*
\v 64 \wj But there¦68879 are some here who don't¦68888 believe me.\wj*” Actually, \nd Yeshua¦68898\nd* had already known¦68891 from the beginning¦68895 just who would believe and¦68904 which person would betray him¦68912
\v 65 so he said¦68918, “\wj That's why I told you that no one can come¦68923 to me unless the father¦68935 has given¦68931 them to me.\wj*”
\p
\v 66 After this, many of his¦68945 followers¦68944 went¦68946 back and no longer¦68951 accompanied him around.
\p
\v 67 So \nd Yeshua¦68960\nd* said¦68956 to his twelve¦68962 \add apprentices\add*, “\wj Don't you want to leave as well?\wj*”
\p
\v 68 \x + \xo 6:68-69: \xt Mat 16:16; Mrk 8:29; Luk 9:20.\x*“\nd Master¦68975\nd*,” Simon¦68973 answered¦68968, “if we went, who would we follow then? You're the \add only\add* one who teaches about living forever.
\v 69 We believe¦68985 and¦68986 know that you¦68990 are the holy son of \nd God¦68998\nd*.”
\p
\v 70 \nd Yeshua¦69004\nd* responded, “\wj Didn't I choose all twelve¦69015 of you myself? And yet one of you is a devil¦69023.\wj*”
\v 71 (He was talking¦69025 about Yudas, Simon¦69029 Iscariot's son, because¦69036 he was the one who would go on to betray him.)

\v 1 After all this, \nd Yeshua¦69054\nd* travelled around Galilee¦69059. (He didn't want to travel around Yudea because the leaders there wanted to execute him¦69071.)
\v 2 \x + \xo 7:2: \xt Lev 23:34; Deu 16:13.\x*As it¦69075 was now getting close to the Jewish Feast With Tents,
\v 3 his¦69092 brothers¦69091 said¦69085 to him, “You should leave this place and go down to Yudea so that all your¦69107 followers¦69106 can see the miracles that you're¦69117 doing¦69117.
\v 4 If you want to become well-known, you don't do things¦69135 out of the main stream. If you want to do miracles, \add go and\add* show yourself¦69138 to the wider world¦69140.
\v 5 (You see, not even Yeshua's own \add half-\add*brothers believed¦69147 \add that he¦69144 came from God\add*.)
\p
\v 6 So \nd Yeshua¦69156\nd* responded, “\wj Well, you guys can do that any time, but it's not the right time for me yet.\wj*
\v 7 \wj All the people won't hate you¦69181 guys, but¦69183 they do hate me because¦69185 I teach about the evil¦69195 things they are doing.\wj*
\v 8 \wj You all go¦69198 on down to Yerusalem ahead of me. I'm not going¦69207 to the feast yet because¦69212 it's not yet the right time¦69217 for me.\wj*”
\v 9 After saying this, Yeshua stayed up in Galilee¦69232.

\p
\v 10 But after his¦69239 \add half-\add*brothers had left to go down to Yerusalem, Yeshua also went—not in the public limelight but just incognito so to speak.
\v 11 However at the celebrations, the Jewish religious leaders were searching for him, and were asking around where he was.
\p
\v 12 Even among¦69277 the crowds¦69280 there¦69275 was a lot of quiet banter with some saying that Yeshua is a good man and others¦69289 complaining that he was misleading the people.
\v 13 Either way, no one was speaking¦69301 out in public¦69300 about him¦69304, because¦69306 they were afraid of the reaction of the religious leaders.
\rem /s1 Jesus Teaches at the Feast
\p
\v 14 \nd Finally¦69320\nd* sometime in the middle¦69315 of the celebrations, \nd Yeshua¦69320\nd* went¦69317 into the temple¦69323 and¦69324 started teaching¦69325 in there.
\v 15 Even the Jewish leaders were surprised, asking, “How can this man know so much when he¦69329 hasn't been trained as a teacher?”
\p
\v 16 \nd Yeshua¦69342\nd* himself responded, “\wj \nd My¦69342\nd* teaching¦69347 doesn't come from me, but¦69351 from the one who sent¦69353 me.\wj*
\v 17 \wj If anyone¦69356 wants to do God's will, they'll soon figure out whether¦69367 my teaching¦69366 comes from God or if I'm just making it¦69372 up myself¦69376.\wj*
\v 18 \wj Any person who just teaches their own thoughts is just seeking their own advancement, but¦69389 anyone who wants to promote the one who sent¦69394 them, this is authentic and¦69399 there's no hidden self-interest.\wj*
\v 19 \wj Didn't Moses write down God's commandments for you, yet not a single one of you obeys them. Why are you wanting to execute me?\wj*”
\p
\v 20 “You must be demon-possessed¦69429,” said some in the crowd¦69426, “Who would be wanting to execute you¦69432.”
\p
\v 21 \nd Yeshua¦69438\nd* responded, “\wj I did one miracle and you¦69448 were all amazed¦69448.\wj*
\v 22 \x + \xo 7:22: a \xt Lev 12:3; \xo b \xt Gen 17:10.\x*\wj Moses gave¦69453 you the commandment about circumcision (even though it actually came from before his time), but to obey this, you'll even circumcise a baby boy on the Rest Day.\wj*
\v 23 \x + \xo 7:23: \xt Jn 5:9.\x*\wj So if a \add baby\add* boy can be circumcised¦69477 on the Rest Day so that Moses' commandments aren't broken¦69485, they why did you get angry¦69492 with me because¦69493 I made a man healthy¦69497 on the Rest Day?\wj*
\v 24 \wj Don't just ‘judge’ things so that you yourselves look good, but¦69506 judge impartially, seeking the best for others.\wj*”

\p
\v 25 After this, some of the locals from Yerusalem started asking, “Isn't this the man they¦69522 were wanting to execute?
\v 26 Well, here he is teaching in public¦69526, yet they're not even confronting him. Perhaps¦69534 the leaders know that he really is the \nd messiah¦69546\nd*?
\v 27 But we¦69549 even know where this man is from. Surely when the \nd messiah¦69555\nd* comes, no one would know his family background.”
\p
\v 28 So as \nd Yeshua¦69584\nd* continued teaching¦69582, he called out, “\wj Indeed you all know me and my home and my family. But I didn't come¦69600 here of my own accord, but the one who sent¦69606 me here is truthful, even though you don't¦69599 even know him.\wj*
\v 29 \wj I know him, because¦69616 I came from him, indeed, he was the one who sent¦69623 me here.\wj*”
\p
\v 30 So now they really want to arrest¦69630 him, but no one touched him because¦69642 it was not yet the proper time.
\v 31 Many in the crowd¦69656 did believe¦69659 that he was from God and they were saying¦69663, “When the \nd messiah¦69667\nd* comes, would he be doing¦69676 greater miracles than what we've seen this man¦69678 do?”

\v 33 So \nd Yeshua¦69712\nd* said¦69707, “\wj I'll only be with you¦69718 all for a short while longer and¦69720 then I'll be going¦69721 to the one who sent¦69724 me.\wj*
\v 34 \wj You'll look for me but won't be able to find me, and you can't go where¦69734 I'll be going.\wj*”
\p
\v 35 The leaders wondered, “Where¦69750 could he be going that we wouldn't be able to find him? Will he go and live with the Jews¦69747 living out there among the Greeks and start teaching¦69770 the Greeks?
\v 36 And what does he mean about looking¦69785 for¦69785 him and not being able to find him, and not being able to go where¦69792 he goes?”

\v 41 Others¦69905 said, “He must be the messiah.”

\v 46 They answered¦70007, “We've never¦70014 heard anyone speak like he¦70011 does.”

\p
\v 12 \x + \xo 8:12: \xt Mat 5:14; Jn 9:5.\x*Because of this, \nd Yeshua¦70390\nd* told them, “\wj \em I am\em* the light of the world¦70402—whoever follows¦70404 me won't walk in the darkness¦70413 but will have the light of life¦70420.\wj*”
\p
\v 13 \x + \xo 8:13: \xt Jn 5:31.\x*Some from the Pharisee¦70425 party¦70425 argued, “You are testifying¦70429 about¦70427 yourself¦70428, so that testimony¦70431 is invalid.”
\p
\v 14 \nd Yeshua¦70438\nd* responded, “\wj Even when I am testifying about¦70447 myself¦70448, my¦70455 testimony¦70454 is valid, because¦70458 I know where I came¦70461 from and where I'm going.\wj*
\v 15 \wj You all are judging according¦70476 to your earthly values. I'm not judging anyone.\wj*
\v 16 \wj But even if I was judging, my judgement would be correct, because¦70499 it wouldn't just be me judging, but also the father¦70510 who sent me.\wj*
\v 17 \x + \xo 8:17: \xt Deu 19:15.\x*\wj It's even written¦70518 in your¦70517 own laws that the testimony¦70525 of two¦70522 men¦70523 is valid.\wj*
\v 18 \wj So that's me testifying about myself¦70534, plus the father¦70543 who sent¦70541 me also testifies about me.\wj*”
\p
\v 19 “And where is your¦70551 father?” they asked.
\p \nd Yeshua¦70554\nd* answered¦70552 them, “\wj You don't know either me or my father. If you did know me, then you'd also know my father.\wj*”
\p
\v 20 He explained all this while he was teaching¦70587 in the treasury¦70586 part of the temple¦70590, but no one arrested¦70593 him because¦70595 the time for his¦70600 \add suffering\add* had not yet arrived.

\v 21 So he continued, “\wj I will be going away and all of you will be looking¦70611 for¦70611 me, but you'll all just die in your¦70619 sins and won't be able to go where¦70621 I'll be going.\wj*”
\p
\v 22 This puzzled the Jewish teachers, “Surely¦70633 he's not going to commit suicide! What else could he mean about ‘you can't go where I'm going to be going’?”
\p
\v 23 Yeshua explained, “\wj All of you¦70663 are from the world below¦70655, but I'm from the world above¦70661. You all are part of this world, but I'm not part of it.\wj*
\v 24 \wj That's why I said that you'll be dying in your sins, because¦70688 if you refuse to believe¦70690 that I am \add God\add*, you will indeed all be dying in your sins.\wj*”
\p
\v 25 “So who are you?” they asked.
\p And he answered, “\wj Still just the same as I've been telling you from the beginning¦70718.\wj*
\v 26 \wj I have a lot that I need to tell you¦70729 all and to judge many of your actions, because the one who sent¦70736 me is true, and it's what I hear from him¦70746 that I speak to all people.\wj*”
\p
\v 27 (They didn't realise that he was talking¦70761 to them about¦70757 the father¦70758 \add in heaven\add*.)
\v 28 So \nd Yeshua¦70770\nd* told them, “\wj When you all lift up\f + \fr 8:28 \ft lifted up / exalted: There's a play on words here.

\v 29 \wj And the one who sent¦70806 me is with me—he didn't just leave me alone¦70814—because¦70820 I am continually doing¦70825 what pleases¦70823 him.\wj*”
\p
\v 30 After he'd said all this, many people believed¦70831 in him.

\v 31 Because of this, \nd Yeshua¦70837\nd* told all the Jews¦70842 who believed¦70840 in him¦70841, “\wj If you all continue to believe my message¦70849, then you're my true followers¦70854.\wj*

\p
\v 34 “\wj I can assure you all that anyone who sins is a slave¦70904 to sin,\wj*” \nd Yeshua¦70893\nd* answered¦70889.
\v 35 “\wj And the slaves¦70910 don't¦70911 necessarily remain in the \add family\add* home forever—only the children have that right.\wj*
\v 36 \wj So if the son sets you free, then you'll be truly free.\wj*

\p And \nd Yeshua¦71007\nd* responded, “\wj Well, if you really were descendants of Abraham, you'd behave more like him¦70995.\wj*
\v 40 \wj But instead you're trying to find a way to have me killed—to kill the man¦71026 who has spoken¦71031 the truth to you—truth that I heard¦71035 from \nd God¦71039\nd*. Abraham¦71041 never did that.\wj*
\v 41 \wj You're doing¦71046 what \em your¦71051\em* father wants you all do to.\wj*”
\rem /s1 The Children of the Devil
\p But they shot back, “It's not us who was conceived by a couple that weren't even married! Anyway, we only have one father and that's \nd God¦71068\nd*.”
\p
\v 42 “\wj If God was your¦71081 father¦71079 you all would¦71084 be loving¦71083 me,\wj*” \nd Yeshua¦71073\nd* responded, “\wj because I came¦71092 from God and for God. I didn't just come¦71102 by myself¦71100, but God sent¦71107 me here.\wj*
\v 43 \wj Why can't you comprehend what I'm saying? The reason¦71109 that you can't stand listening to my message¦71123\wj*
\v 44 \wj is because you come from your father, the devil¦71131, and you want to do what \em your\em* father wants. But he was a murderer¦71142 from the beginning¦71145, and doesn't stick to the truth because there's no truth in him.

\v 45 \wj But because¦71177 I'm speaking¦71180 the truth¦71179, you¦71184 don't¦71183 believe¦71184 in me.\wj*

\v 48 The Jewish leaders asked, “Aren't we right¦71235 in saying¦71236 that you're¦71243 from Samaria¦71241 and that you have a demon¦71245?”
\p
\v 49 “\wj No, I don't¦71254 have a demon¦71253,\wj*” \nd Yeshua¦71249\nd* answered¦71247, “\wj but¦71256 I honour¦71257 my¦71261 father¦71260 and¦71262 you're dishonouring¦71264 me.\wj*
\v 50 \wj But I'm not searching greatness for myself—my¦71272 father is the one searching and¦71276 the one judging¦71277.\wj*
\v 51 \wj I can assure you¦71281, that anyone¦71285 who puts my teaching into practice can be certain to avoid death¦71293 in \add this\add* age.\wj*”
\p
\v 52 “Now we \em know\em* that you have a demon¦71311!” the Jews¦71307 said¦71302. “Abraham¦71313 and the prophets¦71317 all died¦71314, but you're¦71312 saying¦71320 that those who follow your teaching can be certain to avoid death¦71337 in \add this\add* age.
\v 53 How could you be greater¦71343 than our¦71347 ancestor Abraham¦71348 who died? Even the prophets¦71354 died. Who do you think you are?”
\p
\v 54 Again \nd Yeshua¦71363\nd* answered¦71361, “\wj If I praise myself¦71367, my praise is worthless, but it's my father¦71375 who praises me—the one who you¦71381 say is your \nd God¦71385\nd*\wj*

\v 56 \wj Your¦71424 ancestor Abraham¦71421 would have been excited to see me here—in fact he did see ahead and was very happy about it.\wj*”
\p
\v 57 Because of that, the Jewish leaders asked, “You aren't even fifty¦71444 years old yet. How could you have seen¦71451 Abraham?”\f + \fr 8:57 \ft Abraham lived some 2,000 years before Yeshua.\f*

\p
\v 59 When they heard that, they picked up rocks to throw¦71474 at Yeshua \add to kill him¦71476\add*. But Yeshua became hidden¦71479 from their sight, and went on out of the temple¦71484.

\p
\v 1 As Yeshua was walking along, he¦71496 saw¦71496 a man¦71497 who had been blind¦71498 from birth¦71500
\v 2 and his followers¦71506 asked¦71503 him, “Honoured teacher, why was this man¦71512 born blind¦71519? Was it because he himself sinned¦71511, or his parents¦71516?”
\p
\v 3 \nd Yeshua¦71524\nd* answered¦71522, “\wj It wasn't that either this man¦71526 or his¦71531 parents¦71530 sinned¦71527, but it was so that \nd God¦71538\nd* can work in him for others to see.\wj*

\p
\v 6 After he'd said¦71575 this, Yeshua spat on the ground¦71577 and after mixing some clay into a slurry, he spread¦71585 it on the eyes¦71594 of the man
\v 7 and told him¦71600 to go and wash in the Siloam Pool.\f + \fr 9:7 \ft Siloam means ‘to be sent out’.\f*
\p
\v 8 Then the neighbours¦71623 of the man and others who had seen him earlier¦71630, knowing that he was a beggar¦71632 asked, “Isn't he the one who always sat and begged here?”
\p
\v 9 And indeed, some were saying, “Yes, this is him.” But others¦71648 were saying, “No, but he looks quite similar¦71655.”
\p And the man said, “I \em am\em* him.”
\p
\v 10 So they¦71664 asked him¦71671, “Well, how come that now you¦71677 can see?”
\p
\v 11 “A man named \nd Yeshua¦71688\nd* made a slurry,” he said, “and spread¦71692 it on my eyes and told me to go and wash at Siloam Pool. So I went and did it, and when I washed¦71715 my eyes, I could see.”
\p
\v 12 “Where¦71726 is he now?” they¦71722 asked.
\rem /s1 The Pharisees Investigate the Healing
\p “I don't¦71731 know,” said¦71722 the man.
\s1 The Pharisees can't accept the healing of the blind man
\p
\v 13 Then they brought the man¦71741 who had been blind¦71741 to the Pharisees.
\v 14 Now, it¦71742 had been the Rest Day when \nd Yeshua¦71754\nd* had made the slurry and¦71755 enabled him¦71759 to see,
\v 15 and because of this, some in the Pharisee¦71769 party¦71769 asked him how it was that now he could see. And he answered, “Well, he put a slurry on my¦71780 eyes¦71784 and when I washed¦71787 them, I could see.”
\p
\v 16 “Well clearly that man is not from \nd God¦71805\nd*,” some of them said, “because¦71808 he doesn't respect the Rest Day.”
\p However others said, “But if he's just a sinner, how could he do miracles like that?”
\p
\v 17 So they asked the man who had been blind¦71836, “Well, what do \em you\em* have to say because¦71847 it was your¦71850 eyes¦71852 that he opened¦71848?”
\p “He must be a prophet¦71857,” the man said.
\p
\v 18 But some of the Jews¦71863 weren't even sure that he really had been blind¦71869 before and could now see, so they called¦71875 for his¦71880 parents¦71879
\v 19 and asked¦71885 them, “You two say that this is your¦71895 son and that he was born blind¦71900. If so, how come that now he can see?”
\p
\v 20 His¦71915 parents¦71914 answered¦71909, “We know that he's our¦71925 son, and we know that he was born blind¦71928.
\v 21 But as for how come he can now see, we don't¦71935 know that. Nor do we know who healed his¦71941 eyes¦71944. But ask¦71955 him—he's old enough to speak¦71960 for himself¦71959.”
\v 22 (His¦71966 parents said these¦71961 things¦71961 because they were afraid of the Jewish religious leaders, because the leaders had already¦71971 announced that anyone¦71980 who said that Yeshua was the \nd messiah¦71984\nd* would get banned from all religious ceremonies,
\v 23 so that's why they had said¦71993, “He's old enough—just ask¦72000 him.”)
\p
\v 24 So the leaders summoned the man born blind¦72014 a second¦72009 time and commanded him, “Only praise \nd God¦72022\nd* himself for this, because we know that that man is a sinner¦72031.”
\p
\v 25 “Well, I don't¦72041 know whether or not he's a sinner¦72039,” replied the man. “All I know is that I used to be blind¦72047 but now I can see.”
\p
\v 26 “What did he do to you?” they asked again. “How did he open your¦72067 eyes¦72069?”
\p
\v 27 And he answered¦72074, “I already¦72078 told you that, and you didn't even listen. Why do you want to hear¦72087 it all over again¦72084? Do you guys all want to become¦72096 his¦72093 followers¦72094 as well?”
\p
\v 28 Then they¦72100 insulted¦72100 him¦72102 and¦72103 said¦72105, “\em You\em* might be a follower¦72108 of that man, but¦72114 \em we¦72112\em* are followers¦72118 of Moses.

\p
\v 30 “Wow, that's pretty amazing,” the man responded. “That man opened¦72164 up my¦72167 eyes¦72169, and you teachers don't¦72159 even know where¦72161 he's from!
\v 31 We know that \nd God¦72175\nd* doesn't listen to sinners¦72173, but he listens to those who worship him and do what he wants.

\p
\v 34 They reacted, “You're just an ignorant sinner, and you think you can teach¦72237 \em us\em*!” Then they had him thrown¦72240 out of the room.

\p
\v 19 The Jewish religious leaders were again¦72801 divided about Yeshua's teaching
\v 20 with many of them saying¦72810, “He's got a demon¦72818,” and, “He's stark raving¦72821 mad—why are you¦72825 all even listening to him¦72824!”
\p
\v 21 But others were saying¦72829, “He doesn't sound like he's demon-possessed. And how could a demon make a blind¦72843 man see?”

\p
\v 22 By then it was winter¦72858 and the time for the Jewish Feast of Dedication in Yerusalem¦72856.
\v 23 \nd Yeshua¦72865\nd* was walking¦72862 in the temple¦72868 in an area known as Solomon's¦72873 \nd Porch¦72865\nd*
\v 24 when he was surrounded¦72876 by the Jewish religious leaders and interrogated, “How long do you plan to keep us in suspense¦72891 for? If you are the \nd messiah¦72896\nd*, just tell us clearly.”
\p
\v 25 “\wj I already told you all,\wj*” \nd Yeshua¦72905\nd* answered¦72902, “\wj but you didn't believe¦72911 me. The miracles that I do with the authority of my¦72925 father¦72924 testify¦72930 about me,\wj*
\v 26 \wj but you don't¦72936 accept what the miracles point to because¦72938 you aren't part of my flock.\wj*

\v 30 \wj The father¦73022 and¦73020 I are one.\wj*”
\p
\v 31 Again the Jewish leaders picked up rocks to throw at him to kill him
\v 32 but \nd Yeshua¦73039\nd* asked them, “\wj I showed¦73044 you all many miracles from my¦73051 father¦73050. Which miracle do you want to kill me for?\wj*”
\p
\v 33 \x + \xo 10:33: \xt Lev 24:16.\x*They answered¦73062, “It's not for any \em good¦73069\em* deed that we think you deserve to die, but because¦73078 you, a human¦73080, dishonour \nd God¦73085\nd* by claiming to be him¦73064.”
\p
\v 34 \x + \xo 10:34: \xt Psa 82:6.\x*\nd Yeshua¦73089\nd* answered¦73086, “\wj Isn't it¦73094 written¦73095 in your¦73103 scriptures that God said¦73106, ‘You all are gods¦73108’?\wj*
\v 35 \wj Now the scriptures¦73127 can't be wrong, and¦73122 if the ones who heard teaching from \nd God¦73120\nd* were called¦73112 gods¦73113,\wj*

\v 37 \wj If I'm not doing¦73151 my¦73156 father's¦73155 work, then you don't¦73150 need to believe¦73158 that he sent me,\wj*

\p
\v 39 That was enough that they tried yet again¦73200 to arrest¦73201 him, but he was able to get out and away from their¦73207 influence.
\p
\v 40 \x + \xo 10:40: \xt Jn 1:28.\x*Then Yeshua crossed the Yordan¦73214 river to the place¦73217 where¦73219 Yohan¦73221 had immersed¦73225 the people, and he stayed there¦73229.
\v 41 Many people visited him there, and they were saying¦73236 that even though Yohan¦73238 had never done even one miracle, on the other¦73247 hand everything that he had said about Yeshua was true,
\v 42 and many people there¦73264 believed¦73260 that Yeshua was from God.

\s1 Yeshua is aware of Lazarus' death from afar
\rem /s1 The Death of Lazarus
\p
\v 1 \x + \xo 11:1: \xt Luk 10:38-39.\x*Now there was a man¦73267 called Lazarus¦73270 who lived in the village¦73275 of Bethany¦73272 along with his sisters¦73283 Martha¦73280 and¦73278 Maria¦73277.
\v 2 \x + \xo 11:2: \xt Jn 12:3.\x*(Maria¦73291 was the one who \jmp later|link-href="#C12V3"\jmp* poured fragrant oil over Yeshua and¦73297 wiped¦73298 his¦73301 feet¦73300 with her¦73304 hair¦73303.) But now their brother¦73308 was seriously ill
\v 3 and so the two sisters¦73320 sent¦73314 a message to Yeshua saying¦73327, “\nd Master¦73329\nd*, this man that you¦73332 love is seriously ill.”
\p
\v 4 However, when \nd Yeshua¦73337\nd* got the message he said¦73338 \add to those around him\add*, “\wj This sickness¦73341 won't end in death¦73346 but in honour for \nd God¦73352\nd*, so that his son will also be honoured because¦73348 of it.\wj*”
\p
\v 5 Now it was true that \nd Yeshua¦73367\nd* loved the three of them.
\v 6 Yet when he heard¦73383 that Lazarus was sick, he stayed in the place¦73396 where he was for two¦73397 more days¦73398
\v 7 before he said to his followers¦73406, “\wj It's time to head down to Yudea again¦73413.\wj*”
\p
\v 8 But they double-checked, “Honoured teacher, the Yudeans wanted to execute you, so do you really want to go back there¦73429 again¦73427?”
\p
\v 9 And \nd Yeshua¦73432\nd* answered¦73430, “\wj There are twelve hours¦73436 of light in the day. Anyone who walks during the daytime doesn't stumble¦73452 because¦73453 he is seeing¦73460 the light of this world¦73457.\wj*
\v 10 \wj But anyone¦73463 who walks at night¦73467 will stumble¦73468, because¦73469 the light¦73471 is not in them.\wj*”
\v 11 And he continued, “\wj Our¦73488 friend¦73487 Lazarus¦73484 has fallen¦73489 asleep¦73489, but I'm going¦73492 so that I can wake him up.\wj*”
\p
\v 12 But his followers¦73503 objected, “\nd Master¦73506\nd*, \add it's good\add* if he's sleeping because it helps with healing.”
\p
\v 13 But \nd Yeshua¦73515\nd* had spoken¦73512 about Lazarus' death¦73519—not just normal sleep as they had thought.
\v 14 \nd So¦73538\nd* \nd Yeshua¦73538\nd* told them plainly¦73539, “\wj Lazarus¦73540 is dead\wj*
\v 15 \wj and I'm glad that I wasn't there¦73554, because¦73547 you all will benefit as your¦73547 faith grows. Anyway, let's get moving.\wj*”
\p
\v 16 Thomas (nicknamed ‘Twin’) grumbled to the others, “Yeah, we might as well go so that we can get killed as well.”

\p
\v 17 So when they eventually arrived, Lazarus body had already¦73588 been in the burial chamber for four¦73587 days¦73589.
\v 18 The village of Bethany¦73599 was less than three kilometres from Yerusalem¦73602,
\v 19 so many of the Yudeans from there had come¦73615 out to console¦73625 Martha¦73620 and¦73621 Maria¦73623 after the death of their¦73628 brother¦73629.
\p
\v 20 As soon as Martha¦73633 heard¦73635 that \nd Yeshua¦73638\nd* had arrived, she went out to meet him, but Maria¦73642 stayed behind where she was sitting¦73650 in the house¦73647.
\v 21 Martha¦73655 cried, “\nd Yeshua¦73658\nd*, \nd master¦73660\nd*. \nd If¦73658\nd* you'd been here, my¦73670 brother¦73669 wouldn't¦73666 have died¦73667,
\v 22 because I already know that anything that you ask from \nd God¦73687\nd*, he will give it to you.”
\p
\v 23 \nd Yeshua¦73695\nd* responded, “\wj Your¦73700 brother¦73699 will come back to life.\wj*”
\p
\v 24 “Yes, I know that he'll come back to life at the resurrection¦73711 on the last day¦73715,” said Martha¦73704.
\p
\v 25 But \nd Yeshua¦73721\nd* continued, “\wj \em I am\em* the resurrection¦73725 and¦73726 the life¦73728. Anyone who believes¦73730 that I'm from God, even if they die¦73734 they'll still be living¦73735,\wj*
\v 26 \wj and everyone¦73738 who's alive and believes that I was sent from God, will not die¦73747 in the \add next\add* age.\wj*”
\p
\v 27 Martha replied, “Yes, \nd master¦73758\nd*, I do believe¦73761 that you're¦73764 the \nd messiah¦73767\nd*, God's son, the one sent into this world¦73775.”
\s1 Yeshua weeps with his close friends
\rem /s1 Jesus Weeps
\p
\v 28 After saying this, Martha went¦73782 and quietly called¦73784 her¦73788 sister¦73787 Maria¦73785, “The teacher¦73796 is on his way¦73782 and he wants to see you.”
\v 29 So Maria quickly¦73808 got up and¦73809 went to find him¦73813.
\v 30 \nd At¦73820\nd* that stage, \nd Yeshua¦73820\nd* hadn't yet come¦73818 into the village¦73824 proper, but¦73825 was still¦73827 at the edge where¦73832 Martha¦73836 had met him¦73834.
\v 31 The Yudean people who'd been sitting with Maria¦73852 in sympathy there in the house¦73846, when they saw her get up quickly¦73855 and go out, they assumed that she was going¦73868 to the cemetary to weep there.
\p
\v 32 \nd But¦73885\nd* when Maria¦73879 found \nd Yeshua¦73885\nd*, she¦73881 knelt at his¦73892 feet¦73896 and said, “\nd Master¦73900\nd*, if you'd been here my¦73908 brother¦73911 wouldn't have died¦73909.”
\p
\v 33 Now when \nd Yeshua¦73913\nd* saw¦73916 her weeping there, along with the others that had followed also weeping, he himself¦73942 was quite affected and groaned¦73933 inside,
\v 34 but he just asked, “\wj Where¦73945 has he been laid?\wj*”
\p “\nd Master¦73951\nd*, come and see¦73954,” they replied.
\p
\v 35 \nd Then¦73958\nd* \nd Yeshua¦73958\nd* \add broke down and\add* wept,
\v 36 which made the others comment, “See how much he cared about him.”
\p
\v 37 But some of them mocked, “This is the man who could make a blind¦73986 man see again, yet how come he wasn't able to stop this man from dying!”

\p
\v 38 So \nd Yeshua¦73993\nd* who was still holding back sobs, went to the cemetary. Lazarus' body had been placed in a cave with a stone¦74011 blocking it,
\v 39 and \nd Yeshua¦74017\nd* instructed them to take away the stone¦74020.
\p Martha¦74030 (the sister¦74026 of the dead man) spoke up, “\nd Master¦74031\nd*, the stink¦74033 will be bad because¦74035 it's already¦74032 been four days.”
\p
\v 40 But \nd Yeshua¦74040\nd* responded, “\wj Didn't I tell you that if you would believe¦74046, then you would see God's power?\wj*”
\v 41 So they took¦74054 the stone¦74058 away and \nd Yeshua¦74067\nd* looked upwards¦74072 and said¦74074, “Father, I thank¦74076 you that you listen to me.
\v 42 Actually I know that you always¦74085 hear¦74087 me, but I said¦74094 that for the sake of these people so that they will believe¦74096 that it¦74094 was you who sent¦74100 me here.”
\v 43 After saying that, he¦74106 shouted, “\wj Lazarus¦74109, come¦74111 out!\wj*”
\v 44 Then the man who had died¦74117 \add slowly\add* shuffled out—still with linen¦74128 strips¦74128 wrapped around his hands¦74126 and his feet¦74121, and a cloth wrapped around his face¦74131.

\p
\v 45 Because of that, many of the Yudeans believed¦74170 that Yeshua was from God after having followed Maria¦74160 and¦74161 seeing what Yeshua did.
\v 46 \nd But¦74192\nd* others went¦74177 and¦74182 told the Pharisee¦74181 party¦74181 what \nd Yeshua¦74192\nd* had done.
\v 47 So the chief¦74196 priests¦74196 and the Pharisee¦74199 party¦74199 called a formal meeting and asked, “What should we¦74205 do because¦74207 this man¦74210 is doing many miracles.
\v 48 If we allow¦74218 him to continue like this, all the crowds will be believing¦74222 he's the messiah, and then the Romans will come and destroy both our temple and our governance.”
\p
\v 49 But one of them, Caiaphas who was chief¦74251 priest¦74251 that year¦74254, spoke up, “You don't¦74259 know anything.
\v 50 Don't you all realise that its better for all of us if one man¦74271 dies so that the people¦74275 and the nation¦74280 won't be destroyed?”
\v 51 (He didn't say this from his own thinking, but being¦74291 chief¦74290 priest¦74290 that year¦74293, he was announcing God's message that \nd Yeshua¦74302\nd* was going¦74300 to die for the nation¦74307,
\v 52 and¦74308 not only for this nation¦74312, but¦74314 for all of God's children¦74318 scattered¦74323 around the world to become united.)
\p
\v 53 As a result, from that day¦74333 on they decided that Yeshua needed to be executed.
\v 54 Because of that, \nd Yeshua¦74343\nd* no longer¦74344 walked around Yudea in public¦74345, but¦74350 went¦74351 out to the town of Ephraim¦74361 out in the wilderness¦74359 and¦74364 stayed there¦74341 with his followers¦74371.

\v 56 They were looking¦74401 out for \nd Yeshua¦74405\nd* and as they stood¦74414 around in the temple¦74413, they asked each other, “What do you think? Surely he won't come¦74423 to the celebrations.”
\v 57 The chief¦74432 priests¦74432 and the Pharisee¦74435 party¦74435 had already announced that if anyone¦74442 knew where¦74445 Yeshua was, they must inform them so that they could arrest¦74450 him¦74451.

\v 2 So they prepared dinner for him there¦74482 and Martha¦74485 was serving¦74486 and Lazarus¦74491 was among those sitting¦74496 with Yeshua.
\v 3 \x + \xo 12:3: \xt Luk 7:37-38.\x*\nd Then¦74517\nd* Maria¦74502 took about 300g of very expensive nard oil and smeared it on \nd Yeshua's¦74517\nd* feet, and then wiped¦74519 off his¦74525 feet with her¦74522 own hair¦74521, and the house¦74529 was filled¦74530 with the fragrance of the oil.

\v 5 “How come this lotion wasn't sold for almost a year's wages and¦74571 then the money given¦74572 to the poor?”
\v 6 But he didn't say this because he cared for poor people, but because he carried the purse for the group and used to steal from it.

\s1 Many people refuse to stand for Yeshua
\p
\v 37 Even though Yeshua had done so many miracles in front of the people, they¦75273 didn't believe¦75273 that he was the messiah.
\v 38 \x + \xo 12:38: \xt Isa 53:1 (LXX).\x*This fulfilled¦75283 what the prophet¦75282 Isayah wrote,

\q1 And who was the master's power revealed¦75297 to?”
\p
\v 39 Because¦75298 of this, they¦75301 weren't able to believe¦75303, and again¦75307 as Isayah¦75309 wrote,

\q1 so that they can't see with their eyes and understand¦75328 with their minds,

\p
\v 41 Isayah wrote this because¦75345 he saw¦75348 the messiah's greatness and spoke¦75355 concerning¦75356 him.
\v 42 Likewise¦75358, many of the Jewish leaders believed¦75366 that Yeshua was the messiah, but they didn't tell others because¦75370 they didn't want the Pharisee¦75372 party¦75372 to banish them from their services

\v 1 Even before¦75545 the actual feast part of the Passover celebrations, \nd Yeshua¦75553\nd* knew that his time had come—the time when he would leave this world and \add return\add* to the father¦75571. He loved his followers who were in the world right through to the end¦75581.
\p
\v 2 And now it was getting near time for the dinner and the devil¦75590 had already¦75591 put into Yudas Iscariot's mind¦75595 \add the idea\add* of handing Yeshua over \add to the authories\add*.
\v 3 Yeshua knew that the father¦75622 had given¦75618 everything to him, putting it under his control, and he knew that he had come from God and would return to God.
\v 4 So he got up from the dinner \add table\add*, changed out of his clothes¦75646, and wrapped a linen¦75650 towel¦75650 around himself¦75653.

\v 6 After he'd washed a few, he got to Simon¦75683 Peter who asked him, “\nd Master¦75690\nd*, are you going to wash my¦75692 feet¦75695?”
\p

\v 21 After saying¦76001 these¦75987 things¦75987, \nd Yeshua¦75990\nd* thoughts were troubled and he said, “\wj I can assure you that one of you will be turning me in.\wj*”

\v 22 This made his apprentices¦76018 glance around at each other, puzzled about which one he was talking¦76024 about.

\p
\v 26 “\wj It's the one I hand this piece of bread to after I've dipped it \add in the sauce\add*,\wj*” \nd Yeshua¦76088\nd* answered¦76084. Then after dipping his piece of bread in, he gave it to Yudas Iscariot.
\v 27 After accepting the piece¦76123 of bread¦76123, Satan¦76129 entered into Yudas, and then \nd Yeshua¦76135\nd* told him¦76133, “What you're¦76137 about to do, do it soon.”
\v 28 But none of the others sitting¦76147 around the table knew¦76144 what Yeshua meant.
\v 29 Some of them thought that since Yudas held their purse, perhaps \nd Yeshua¦76169\nd* was getting him¦76167 to buy something they needed for the feast¦76178 or to give¦76184 something to the poor.
\p
\v 30 Anyway, having¦76186 eaten the piece¦76189 of bread¦76189, Yudas went straight outside where it¦76194 was already dark.

\p
\v 28 Then they led \nd Yeshua¦79635\nd* out from Caiaphas' place and towards the residence of the governor. It was now the early¦79645 hours of the morning and as Jews, they didn't enter the residence of the Roman governor so they wouldn't become defiled¦79655 and thus unable to eat¦79658 the Passover meal.
\v 29 So Governor Pilate¦79666 came¦79661 outside¦79667 to them and¦79671 asked, “What charge are you¦79676 all bringing¦79676 against¦79677 this man¦79679?”
\p
\v 30 “We wouldn't¦79696 have brought him to you if he hadn't committed a serious crime,” they answered¦79681.
\p
\v 31 So Pilate¦79706 said, “You just take him and judge¦79716 him yourselves according¦79712 to your¦79715 own laws.”
\p But the Jewish leaders responded, “We don't¦79725 have permission¦79726 to execute anyone.”
\v 32 (\nd This¦79734\nd* happened to fulfil¦79735 what \nd Yeshua¦79734\nd* had said\x + \xo 18:32: \xt Jn 3:14; 12:32.\x*about the way that he was going¦79743 to die.)
\p
\v 33 So Pilate¦79754 went back into his governor's¦79751 residence¦79751 and called¦79756 for \nd Yeshua¦79758\nd* and asked him¦79761, “So you're the king¦79766 of the Jews¦79768?”
\p
\v 34 “\wj Are you saying¦79780 this yourself¦79776,\wj*” \nd Yeshua¦79774\nd* asked, “\wj or did others¦79783 say it¦79785 about me?\wj*”
\p
\v 35 Pilate¦79792 retorted, “Hoy! I'm not a Jew¦79797. It was your own people and the chief¦79806 priests¦79806 that handed you over to me. What have you done?”
\p
\v 36 “\wj My kingdom isn't in this world,\wj*” \nd Yeshua¦79815\nd* answered¦79813, “\wj because if it was, my supporters would have fought so that I wouldn't have been handed over to the Jewish leaders. But no, my kingdom isn't from here.\wj*”
\p
\v 37 “So you \em are\em* a king then?” Pilate¦79867 responded.
\p “\wj You're saying¦79879 that I'm a king,\wj*” said \nd Yeshua¦79875\nd*, “\wj and indeed I was born to be a king. I came into the world¦79896 so that I could testify¦79898 to the truth.\wj*”
\p
\v 38 “\add Yeah.\add* What is truth¦79923?” said Pilate.

\p After he'd said this, Pilate went back outside to the Jews¦79931 and told them, “I can't find anything that he's guilty of.
\v 39 But you all have a custom¦79945 here that the governor can release one prisoner during the Passover. So would you like me to release the king¦79963 of the Jews¦79965?”
\p
\v 40 But they¦79966 all yelled¦79966 back, “No, not this one. Release Barabbas.” (Barabbas was a robber¦79980.)

\p
\v 1 \nd So¦79989\nd* Pilate¦79986 took¦79983 \nd Yeshua¦79989\nd* and¦79990 had him¦79991 flogged¦79991.
\v 2 Then the soldiers¦79994 twisted¦79995 some thorn¦79998 branches together¦79995 into a crown¦79996 and put it¦80000 on Yeshua's head, and they dressed him in a \add royal\add* purple¦80010 robe¦80009.
\v 3 They came up to him and said, “Greetings¦80019, you king¦80021 of the Jews¦80024,” and then slapped him.
\p
\v 4 Then Pilate¦80036 went back outside¦80034 and said to the Jews, “Look here. I'm bringing¦80042 him out to you so that you all can know¦80047 that I didn't find him guilty¦80055 of anything.”
\v 5 So they led \nd Yeshua¦80066\nd* out wearing¦80068 the thorny¦80071 crown¦80072 and the kingly robe¦80076, and Pilate said, “Look. Here's the man¦80083.”
\p
\v 6 Now when the chief¦80089 priests¦80089 and their supporters saw¦80086 him, they yelled¦80095 out, “Execute him on a stake! Execute him on a stake!”
\p “Well you take him and execute¦80110 him on a stake,” Pilate¦80104 answered, “because¦80112 I haven't found anything that he's guilty¦80118 of.”
\p
\v 7 The Jews¦80122 responded, “We have a law and he should be executed according¦80127 to that law because¦80133 he said he was the son of \nd God¦80137\nd*.”
\p
\v 8 Now when Pilate¦80145 heard¦80143 that, he became more afraid¦80151.
\v 9 So he went back inside the residence¦80156 and asked Yeshua, “Where do you come from?”
\p But Yeshua didn't answer¦80169 him.
\v 10 So Pilate¦80177 said, “Why don't¦80179 you answer me? Don't you realise that I have the authority to release you and I also have the authority to have you executed¦80192 on a stake¦80192?”
\p
\v 11 “\wj You have no authority¦80203 over me,\wj*” \nd Yeshua¦80199\nd* answered¦80196, “\wj none at all, except¦80208 what has been granted to you from above¦80214. Because¦80215 of this, the sin¦80223 of the person who handed me over to you is greater¦80222.\wj*”
\p
\v 12 After hearing this, Pilate¦80229 wanted to release him but the Jews¦80236 yelled¦80237 out, “If you release that man, you're¦80247 no friend of Caesar. Everyone¦80251 who claims to be a king is no friend of Caesar's.”
\p
\v 13 So now Pilate, having¦80264 heard¦80264 all this, brought¦80271 \nd Yeshua¦80274\nd* outside¦80272 \add again\add*. Pilate sat¦80277 down on the judge's seat at a place¦80282 called The Stone¦80284 Pavement¦80284 (and¦80276 called Gabbatha¦80289 in Hebrew).
\v 14 It was now about¦80299 noon on the day¦80293 when the Passover meal is prepared¦80293, and Pilate said to the Jews¦80307, “Look. Here's your¦80311 king¦80310.”
\p
\v 15 They yelled¦80315 back, “Take him away. Take him away. Execute¦80320 him on a stake.”
\p Pilate¦80325 asked them, “You want me to have your¦80328 king executed¦80329 on a stake?”
\p “We don't¦80333 have any king other than Caesar,” the chief priests¦80332 answered¦80330.
\p
\v 16 So Pilate gave¦80341 them his permission and handed \nd Yeshua¦80355\nd* over to them, and they took¦80349 him away to be executed¦80346 on a stake¦80346.

\v 17 Carrying the pole\f + \fr 19:17 \ft TD: The Greek word used here is used in other places to mean a stake such as used to make a fence. It's uncertain whether or not it had a horizontal cross-piece, although the Romans did use a range of methods.\f* himself¦80364, Yeshua arrived at the Place of the Skull (called Golgotha¦80380 in Hebrew) just out of the city
\v 18 where¦80381 they secured him to a stake along with two¦80388 others¦80387—one stake on each side and with \nd Yeshua¦80396\nd* on the middle¦80393 one.
\v 19 Pilate¦80402 wrote¦80397 out a title¦80400 and¦80403 put it¦80409 on the stake¦80408: \nd Yeshua¦80412\nd* from Nazareth¦80414, the king¦80416 of the Jews¦80418.
\v 20 Many Jews¦80428 read this title¦80423 because¦80429 the place¦80433 where¦80438 \nd Yeshua¦80441\nd* was executed¦80439 was near the city¦80435, and it¦80443 had been written¦80444 in Hebrew, Latin¦80447, and Greek.
\v 21 But the Jewish chief¦80455 priests¦80455 complained to Pilate¦80453, “Don't write ‘The king of the Jews’, but rather ‘The one who \em said\em* he was king of the Jews’.”
\p
\v 22 However Pilate¦80475 answered¦80473, “What I've written, I've written.”
\p
\v 23 After the soldiers¦80481 had fastened \nd Yeshua¦80487\nd* to the stake¦80484, they took¦80488 his clothes¦80490 and placed in four¦80494 piles, one for each of them. This left his robe, which had been woven¦80510 from top to bottom in one piece.
\v 24 So they said to each other, “Rather than tearing this, let's throw a dice to see who will get it.” (This fulfilled¦80531 what was written in the scriptures\x + \xo 19:24: \xt Psa 22:18.\x*that said: they divided¦80534 my garments among themselves¦80539 and threw¦80545 a dice for my clothes¦80537.) So they went ahead and did that.
\p
\v 25 Meanwhile a group of women had stayed standing near \nd Yeshua¦80559\nd* on the stake¦80557: his mother and his aunt, Maria the wife of Clopas¦80573, and Maria from Magdala¦80578.
\v 26 When \nd Yeshua¦80579\nd* saw his mother and also the intern that he loved standing nearby, he said to her, “\wj Look, he'll be your¦80601 son.\wj*”
\v 27 And to the intern he said, “\wj Look, she'll be your¦80610 mother¦80609.\wj*” And that intern took¦80617 her into his own \add home\add* from then on.

\p
\v 28 Having done this, \nd Yeshua¦80630\nd* knew that everything had been accomplished¦80636, and (in order¦80637 for the scriptures\x + \xo 19:28: \xt Psa 69:21; 22:15.\x*to be fulfilled¦80636) said, “\wj I'm thirsty¦80643.\wj*”
\p
\v 29 There was a container lying¦80647 there¦80654 full of vinegary wine, so they placed a sponge¦80653 on a hyssop¦80659 stalk¦80659, soaked it in the wine, and held it up to his mouth¦80664.
\v 30 After \nd Yeshua¦80671\nd* had sucked some wine out, he said¦80672, “\wj It is finished¦80673.\wj*” Then he bowed¦80675 his head and gave¦80678 up his spirit¦80681.

\v 31 Now because it was the preparation¦80686 day\x + \xo 19:31: \xt Jn 19:14.\x*for the coming Rest Day, the Jews¦80684 didn't want the bodies¦80695 to remain¦80690 on the stakes¦80693 after dusk (because it was even a special Rest Day.) So they asked¦80711 Pilate¦80714 to command for their legs to be broken¦80716 \add to hasten their deaths\add* and then they could be taken¦80721 down \add sooner\add*.
\v 32 So the soldiers¦80726 came¦80722 and broke¦80731 the legs of the men on each side of Yeshua,
\v 33 but when they got to him, they saw¦80746 that he was already¦80749 dead so they didn't break his¦80755 legs.
\v 34 Instead one of the soldiers¦80761 stabbed his¦80763 side with a spear¦80762 and immediately¦80771 blood¦80772 and water¦80774 came¦80770 out.

\v 38 After all of this, Yosef from Arimathea¦80830 went to Pilate. (Yosef was a follower of Yeshua, but secretly because¦80838 he was afraid of what the Jewish leaders might do.) He asked¦80823 Pilate for permission¦80850 to remove \nd Yeshua's¦80848\nd* body, and it was granted to him so they went and got his body.
\v 39 \x + \xo 19:39: \xt Jn 3:1-2.\x*Nicodemus (the one who had first¦80878 visited Yeshua at night¦80876) also came¦80865, bringing¦80879 around 30kg of burial spices.
\v 40 So they took¦80890 \nd Yeshua's¦80896\nd* body¦80893 and wrapped it¦80899 around with linen¦80901 strips with the spices¦80905 as per the Jewish burial customs¦80907.
\v 41 There was a garden out at the place¦80917 where¦80918 Yeshua had been executed¦80919, and¦80921 in the garden there¦80913 was a new tomb¦80925 that hadn't been used yet.
\v 42 So because it was the preparation¦80939 day¦80939 and because the tomb¦80946 was nearby, they¦80948 laid his body in there¦80935.

\v 1 The following Sunday, Maria¦80956 from Magdala¦80959 went out to the tomb very early¦80961 when it was still¦80963 dark, and she saw that the stone¦80972 had been removed from the entrance.
\v 2 So she ran quickly and went to Simon¦80986 Peter and the other¦80991 intern that \nd Yeshua¦80996\nd* loved, and told them, “They've taken the \nd master's¦81002\nd* body out of the tomb¦81005 and we don't¦81007 know where¦81009 they've put it.”
\p
\v 3 So Peter and the other¦81018 intern went out to the tomb¦81024.
\v 4 They were running¦81026 together¦81030, but the other¦81034 intern was a bit faster than Peter and so he got to the tomb¦81047 first¦81043.
\v 5 Without going in, he stooped¦81050 down at the entrance and looked in and saw the linen¦81054 strips lying¦81052 there¦81052.
\v 6 But Peter came¦81070 along behind him¦81068 and went straight into the tomb¦81073 and also saw the linen¦81077 strips lying¦81078 there¦81078.
\v 7 But the piece of cloth¦81091 that had been on the head wasn't lying¦81092 there¦81092 with the linen¦81091 strips, but¦81093 had been folded and¦81079 placed¦81098 separately¦81094.

\v 12 she saw two¦81158 messengers¦81159 dressed in white¦81162 sitting¦81163 there—one at the head end and one at the feet¦81172 end of the slab where¦81173 \nd Yeshua's¦81178\nd* body¦81176 had been lying¦81174.
\v 13 They spoke to her¦81181, “Woman¦81183, why are you¦81185 crying?”
\p “Because¦81191 they've taken away my¦81195 \nd master¦81194\nd*,” she replied, “and¦81196 I don't¦81197 know where¦81199 they've put him¦81203.”

\v 14 \nd Then¦81222\nd* she turned¦81207 back around and saw \nd Yeshua¦81215\nd* standing there, but she didn't realise who it was.
\v 15 \nd Yeshua¦81228\nd* asked her, “\wj Woman¦81229, why are you crying? Who are you looking¦81233 for¦81233?\wj*”
\p Maria assumed he might be the gardener¦81239, so she answered, “Mister¦81243, if you took the body, tell me where¦81254 you put it and I'll get it taken away \add for you\add*.”
\p
\v 16 \nd Yeshua¦81266\nd* just answered, “\wj Maria¦81268.\wj*”

\v 17 “\wj Don't touch¦81287 me,\wj*” \nd Yeshua¦81284\nd* said to her, “\wj because¦81290 I haven't gone back up to the father yet, but go and tell my brothers¦81301 that I'm going up to my father and the father of you all, and my god and the god of you all.\wj*”

\v 5 He called out, “\wj Hey, young fellas. Don't you¦81816 have any fish¦81815?\wj*”
\p “None.” they answered¦81817.
\p
\v 6 \x + \xo 21:6: \xt Luk 5:6.\x*Then he said, “\wj Throw the net out over the right¦81828 side of the boat¦81831 and you'll find some.\wj*” So they did it and they caught so many fish that the net was too heavy to pull back in.
\p
\v 7 Now the intern that \nd Yeshua¦81889\nd* loved said to Peter, “It's the master!” When Simon¦81896 Peter heard¦81899 that, he put on his robe (because¦81908 he didn't have it on), and jumped overboard into the lake¦81916.
\v 8 The other¦81919 trainees followed in the little¦81923 boat¦81923 dragging¦81940 the net¦81942 behind them because¦81928 they¦81929 were only about¦81935 100m out from the shore.
\v 9 When they went up the beach, they saw some bread¦81959 there and a charcoal¦81953 fire¦81953 with fish¦81956 cooking on it¦81957
\v 10 and \nd Yeshua¦81963\nd* told them, “\wj Bring¦81964 some of the fish¦81968 that you¦81970 just caught¦81970.\wj*”
\p
\v 11 So Simon¦81975 Peter went and dragged¦81978 the net up onto the beach. Amazingly it hadn't torn even though it contained 153 large¦81991 fish.
\v 12 Then \nd Yeshua¦82005\nd* said, “\wj Now, come and have breakfast¦82007.\wj*” But none of the trainees dared to ask who he was, because they figured it must be the \nd master¦82022\nd*.
\v 13 \nd Yeshua¦82027\nd* brought the bread¦82031 to them and shared it around, and then likewise¦82040 for the fish¦82039.
\p
\v 14 \nd This¦82047\nd* was now the third¦82044 time¦82044 that \nd Yeshua¦82047\nd* had appeared to his trainees since he'd come back to life.

\v 15 While they were eating, Yeshua asked Simon Peter, “\wj Simon, son of Yohan¦82066, do you love me more than these¦82073?\wj*”
\p Peter answered, “Yes, \nd master¦82077\nd*, you know that I love you.”
\p Yeshua responded, “\wj Feed my¦82091 lambs¦82090.\wj*”
\v 16 Then he¦82119 asked again¦82095, “\wj Simon¦82101, son of Yohan¦82102, do you love me?\wj*”
\p Peter replied, “Yes, \nd master¦82109\nd*, you know that I love you.”
\p Yeshua responded, “\wj Shepherd my¦82122 sheep¦82120.\wj*”
\v 17 Then he asked a third time, “\wj Simon¦82127, son of Yohan¦82128, do you love me?\wj*”
\p Peter was now upset that he had been asked a third time if he loved him, and he answered, “\nd Master¦82149\nd*, you know everything.”
\p “\wj Feed my¦82169 sheep¦82167,\wj*” \nd Yeshua¦82164\nd* responded.
\v 18 “\wj I can assure you that while you are young¦82177, you dress yourself¦82179 and go wherever you want to go, but as you age, you'll be stretching¦82187 out your¦82192 hands¦82190 and others will dress you and will take you where you don't¦82212 want to go.\wj*”
\v 19 When he said this, Yeshua was indicating how Peter would die honouring \nd God¦82224\nd*, and he told Peter, “Keep following¦82230 me.”

\v 20 \x + \xo 21:20: \xt Jn 13:25.\x*When Peter turned¦82232 around he saw that the intern that Yeshua loved was following¦82243 them—the one who had leaned on \nd Yeshua's¦82242\nd* chest¦82252 during the supper¦82249 and asked who the one was who would turn Yeshua over.
\v 21 Noticing him, Peter asked \nd Yeshua¦82276\nd*, “\nd Master¦82277\nd*, what about¦82280 that one?”
\p
\v 22 But \nd Yeshua¦82284\nd* replied, “\wj If I want him to stay alive until¦82290 I come back, what business would it¦82292 be of yours? You just stay following¦82298 me.\wj*”
\p
\v 23 As a result of that, a rumour went around the others that that one would not die, but \nd Yeshua¦82325\nd* never said that. (He only said, “If I want him to stay alive until¦82335 I come back, what business would it be of yours?”)
