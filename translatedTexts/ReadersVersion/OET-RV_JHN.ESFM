\mt2 The account of Jesus' ministry by
\mt1 John
\is1 Introduction
\is2 Author
\ip This account about the works and teachings of Jesus was written by John, brother of Jacob (mistakenly known in English as James)—both of them were in the small group of twelve close followers of Jesus that he selected as His apprentices and who accompanied him around as he taught. Out of them, John was the one that greatly loved Jesus, and his closeness gave him much of the insight that he includes with his description of Jesus' actions and teaching. The two brothers were the sons of Zebedee, and they had all worked on Lake Galilee as fishermen.
\is2 This account
\ip The \em Open English Translation\em* places John's account before the others because it begins with the eternal existence of Jesus the messiah. Not only is Jesus the godly messenger, he was also the creator who has now descended from heaven as a man. Omitting any mention of the baby Jesus, John does however tell us about John-the-Immerser who came before Jesus to prepare the people for the arrival of the promised messiah.
\ip In chapters two to twelve it's written how the various miracles that Jesus did showed that he was the promised messiah to offer life without ending to whoever would accept that he had been sent by God and trust in his teaching. Although there were indeed many who did believe in him, many others were unable to come to that point and ended up opposing Jesus at every turn.
\ip In chapters thirteen to seventeen, the compassion of Jesus towards his followers is described. He also told them in advance of his impending brutal death.
\ip In the final few chapters, we read about the arrest and judging of Jesus, his being fastened to a pole and giving up his spirit, his coming back to life, and how his followers saw him and spoke with him again during that period.
\ip John is careful to explain how to receive life without ending by means of believing that Jesus came down from heaven and obeying his teaching. Jesus himself is the road, the truth, and the life.

\s1 The coming of the true light
\p
\v 1 In the beginning¦62921 was the message,\f + \fr 1:1 \ft TD: This passage is difficult to translate because the message was also the messenger—that is Jesus came not only to teach about getting saved, but also to become the actual way to be saved!\f* and the message was with God, and the message was God.
\v 2 The message was with God even at the creation.
\v 3 Everything came into existence through¦62946 the messenger\f + \fr 1:3 \ft Lit. him.\f*—not even one thing¦62955 came into existence apart from him.
\v 4 He holds life, and¦62964 that Life is the light¦62969 of humankind.
\v 5 And that light¦62974 is shining¦62978 in the darkness, and¦62979 darkness cannot overcome him.
\p
\v 6 \x + \xo 1:6: \xt Mat 3:1; Mrk 1:4; Luk 3:1-2.\x*A man¦62986 arrived who had been sent¦62987 by God. His name¦62994 was John.
\v 7 He came¦62999 as a testimony¦63002 to tell about the Light so that everyone would believe¦63010 the light¦63007.
\v 8 John himself wasn't the light—he was merely the announcer of the Light.
\v 9 The true Light which¦63030 enlightens¦63031 every¦63032 person¦63033 was coming¦63034 into the world¦63037.
\p
\v 10 He was in the world and he's the creator of the world, and yet the world didn't even know Acts
\v 11 He came¦63059 to his own chosen people, but they wouldn't accept him¦63063.
\v 12 But whoever would accept him, whoever trusted in His¦63084 authority, he gave¦63071 them the right¦63075 to become¦63078 children¦63076 of God.
\v 13 Not physical children and not coming from human actions, but¦63097 children of God.
\p
\v 14 And the message¦63104 became¦63106 a human and lived here among¦63109 us and we¦63112 saw¦63112 his¦63115 greatness—the greatness of an only child of the father¦63120—full of grace¦63123 and truth¦63125.
\p
\v 15 John explained about him and loudly told everyone, “This is the one I meant when I said¦63137, ‘There's someone coming¦63143 after¦63141 me, yet who came before me, because¦63148 he existed before I did!’ ”
\p
\v 16 Because¦63152 he has so much, we all received¦63161 grace and then even more grace.
\v 17 The commandments came to us through Moses, but grace¦63175 and truth¦63178 came to us through Jesus the messiah¦63181.
\v 18 No one has ever actually seen¦63185 God, but the human son born from God the father¦63200 and in close touch with him, he was the one to explain¦63202 God to us.
\s1 The interrogation of John-the-Immerser
\r (Mat. 3:1-12; Mrk. 1:1-8; Luk. 3:1-18)
\p
\v 19 John explained some of this when the Jewish leaders sent¦63212 out priests¦63220 and¦63221 temple workers from Jerusalem to ask¦63226 him¦63229, “Who are you¦63231?”
\p
\v 20 And he didn't flinch from the truth and told them, “I am not the chosen¦63247 messiah¦63247.”
\p
\v 21 \x + \xo 1:21: a \xt Mal 4:5; \xo b \xt Deu 18:15,18.\x*So they asked him again, “Are you Elijah come back to life?”
\p And he answered, “No, I'm not.”
\p They asked, “Are you the prophet¦63270?”
\p Again he answered, “No, I'm not.”
\p
\v 22 So they asked him¦63279, “Who are you then? We need to give¦63285 an answer¦63284 to the ones who sent¦63287 us. How do you describe yourself¦63293?”
\p
\v 23 \x + \xo 1:23: \xt Isa 40:3 (LXX).\x*So he said, “I am a voice¦63296 shouting¦63297\f + \fr 1:23 \ft We've deliberately omitted putting a comma here, because it's also possible that the comma should go after ‘wilderness’.\f* in the wilderness smooth the path of the master¦63304, as the prophet¦63314 Isaiah said.”
\p
\v 24 Some of the ones sent¦63317 out were members of the Pharisee¦63321 party¦63321.
\v 25 These ones asked¦63323 John, “So why are you immersing¦63331 people then if you aren't the messiah¦63337 or Elijah or the prophet¦63344?”
\p
\v 26 He answered¦63345, “I'm immersing¦63351 people in water¦63355, but somewhere here among us all there's someone you don't know—
\v 27 the one coming¦63372 after¦63370 me, and I'm not even good enough to untie¦63385 his¦63389 sandal¦63390 straps¦63388!”
\p
\v 28 All this happened in Bethany on the east side of the Jordan River where¦63402 John was immersing¦63406 people.
\s1 Jesus gets publicly revealed
\p
\v 29 The next day¦63409 John saw Jesus coming¦63416 towards him¦63418, and¦63419 said, “Hey! Here's the sacrificial lamb of God who's come to take away the sin¦63430 of the world¦63433.
\v 30 This is the man¦63446 I was talking about when I said¦63440, ‘There's someone coming¦63445 after me, yet who came before me, because¦63451 he¦63454 existed before I did.’
\v 31 I didn't know who he¦63462 was but¦63459 nevertheless I came¦63467 and immersed¦63472 people in water¦63471 so that this man could be revealed¦63461 to \add all\add* Israel.”
\p
\v 32 And John further explained, “I saw God's spirit¦63481 come down and¦63490 settle on Acts
\v 33 I didn't know which one was Him, but the one who sent me to immerse people in water¦63508 said, ‘When you see the spirit coming¦63520 down and settling on someone, he is the one who will immerse people with God's holy spirit.’
\v 34 And I have seen¦63537 that, and¦63538 so I can assure you that he¦63543 is God's son.”
\s1 Jesus gets a few followers
\p
\v 35 The next day¦63549, John¦63554 was back there with two¦63560 of his¦63556 apprentices¦63558
\v 36 and noticing Jesus¦63564 walking¦63565 nearby he said, “Look! There's the sacrificial lamb of God.”
\p
\v 37 When his¦63586 two¦63585 apprentices¦63587 heard¦63581 him say that, they left him and followed¦63592 Jesus¦63594.
\v 38 But Jesus¦63598 turned¦63595 and saw them following¦63602 him, and asked them, “What are you two wanting?”
\p And they said¦63610 to him, “Teacher¦63618, where do you stay?”
\p
\v 39 Jesus replied, “Come and see.” So they went with him and saw¦63631 where¦63633 he lived, and they stayed there that night, because it was already after 4pm.
\p
\v 40 Andrew¦63650, the brother¦63652 of Simon Peter was one of those two¦63659 who heard¦63661 John and¦63664 then followed¦63665 Jesus.
\v 41 As soon as he found his brother¦63673, he said to Simon, “We have found the messiah—God's chosen one,”
\v 42 and led him to Jesus. When Jesus saw him, he said¦63701, “Ah, you are Simon John but from now on you'll be called¦63711 Simon Peter which¦63713 means \it stone\it*.”
\s1 Philip and Nathanael join the group
\p
\v 43 The following¦63734 day¦63717, Jesus¦63733 wanted¦63719 to go to Galilee¦63725. He found Philip and¦63729 told him¦63731, “Follow me!”
\v 44 Philip was from the town of Bethsaida where Andrew¦63747 and¦63748 Peter lived.
\v 45 Philip then found Nathanael¦63753 and told him¦63756, “We've found the one that Moses and the prophets¦63765 wrote¦63758 about in the Scriptures. He's Jesus¦63767 from Nazareth¦63776.”
\p
\v 46 And Nathanael¦63780 said¦63778, “Does anything good¦63785 come from Nazareth¦63782?”
\p So Philip answered, “Well, come and¦63793 see¦63794.”
\p
\v 47 Jesus¦63799 saw¦63795 Nathanael¦63801 approaching and¦63805 said, “Ah, this is an honest Israeli¦63813.”
\p
\v 48 But Nathanael¦63822 queried him, “Where do you know me from?”
\p And Jesus¦63829 replied, “Actually I saw¦63842 you under¦63839 that fig¦63841 tree¦63841 before Philip had even called you.”
\p
\v 49 Nathanael¦63846 exclaimed, “Great teacher! You \em are\em* God's son! you're the king¦63862 of Israel!”
\p
\v 50 Jesus¦63868 responded, “So you believe¦63884 this because I said that I had seen you under the fig¦63882 tree¦63882. You'll get to see much greater¦63885 things¦63888 than that!”
\v 51 \x + \xo 1:51: \xt Gen 28:12.\x*And he continued, “Honestly, I'm telling all of you: you'll be seeing¦63901 the sky opened¦63904 up and God's messengers going¦63910 and and coming¦63912 down on me, mankind's child.”

\s1 The wine miracle
\p
\v 1 On the Tuesday\f + \fr 2:1 \ft Or possibly, ‘Three days later’.\f*, there was a wedding¦63924 in Cana in Galilee¦63931, and¦63932 Jesus' mother¦63935 was there.
\v 2 Jesus¦63943 and¦63945 his¦63948 apprentices¦63947 were also invited¦63939.
\v 3 When the wine ran out at the wedding, Jesus' mother¦63968 said to him¦63973, “They haven't got any more wine.”
\p
\v 4 Jesus¦63983 answered, “What does that have to do with us, mother? It's not yet the time for my¦63994 ministry.”
\p
\v 5 But his¦63998 mother¦63997 told the servants¦64000, “Just do whatever¦64001 he tells you.”
\p
\v 6 Now there were six¦64015 empty stone¦64013 water¦64014 jars there that are used for Jewish purification¦64019 ceremonies. (Each one could hold over 70 litres.)
\v 7 So Jesus¦64036 told them to fill the jars with water¦64040, and they¦64042 filled¦64042 them up.
\v 8 Then he said, “Ok, now take a sample out and give it to the MC.” So they took some.
\v 9 And when the MC tasted¦64061 the water that had now turned to wine (but he didn't know where¦64071 it had come from), he called the groom
\v 10 and exclaimed, “Most people supply the best wine at the beginning, and the cheaper stuff when people are a bit tipsy. But you've kept¦64106 the best wine until¦64110 last!”
\p
\v 11 This event in Cana, Galilee¦64126, was the first of the miracles that Jesus did and it revealed¦64129 his greatness, and his followers¦64139 believed¦64134 that he was from God.
\p
\v 12 \x + \xo 2:12: \xt Mat 4:13.\x*After¦64143 that, Jesus and his mother¦64156 and brothers¦64160 and his followers¦64164 travelled east to Capernaum, but they¦64168 only stayed there¦64167 a few days¦64172.
\s1 Jesus disturbs the temple traders
\r (Mat. 21:12-13; Mrk. 11:15-17; Luk. 19:45-46)
\p
\v 13 \x + \xo 2:13: \xt Exo 12:1-27.\x*It was getting close to the time of the Jewish Feast of the Passover, and¦64181 Jesus¦64188 went¦64182 down to Jerusalem.
\v 14 There in the temple¦64193, he discovered merchants selling¦64195 cows and sheep¦64200 and doves¦64204, and moneychangers¦64208 sitting¦64209 at their tables.
\v 15 Jesus formed some cords¦64216 into a whip and drove the sheep¦64227 and cows out of the temple¦64222 grounds, and he overturned¦64243 the tables¦64241—spilling the coins¦64238 of the moneychangers¦64233 onto the ground.
\v 16 He scolded the ones selling¦64250 doves¦64249, saying, “Get them out of here. Don't be making¦64257 my¦64262 father's¦64261 house into a market.”
\v 17 \x + \xo 2:17: \xt Psa 69:9.\x*That reminded¦64267 his¦64271 followers¦64270 of the scripture: “I'll be filled with zeal for your¦64280 temple.”
\p
\v 18 Then the Jewish leaders responded, “Do a miracle to show that you have the authority to do these¦64299 things¦64299.”
\p
\v 19 \x + \xo 2:19: \xt Mat 26:61; 27:40; Mrk 14:58; 15:29.\x*But Jesus¦64303 answered¦64301, “Well, destroy this temple¦64309 and I'll raise\f + \fr 2:19 \ft We couldn't easily use \em rebuild\em* here because there's a play on words—see verse 21.\f* it¦64316 again in three¦64313 days¦64314.”
\p
\v 20 The leaders smirked, “This temple¦64329 took 46-years to build, and you'll raise it¦64339 again in three¦64336 days¦64337?”
\p
\v 21 But Jesus had been meaning his¦64349 own body¦64348 when he was talking about the temple¦64346.
\v 22 In the future when he was actually raised¦64353 from the dead¦64355, his¦64359 followers¦64358 remembered this statement, and they believed¦64366 both the Hebrew scriptures¦64368 and Jesus' message¦64371.
\s1 Jesus does miracles and knows thoughts
\p
\v 23 And when Jesus was at the Passover Feast in Jerusalem, many believed¦64390 in his¦64394 authority because they saw the miracles that he was able to do.
\v 24 But Jesus¦64404 never fully entrusted¦64406 himself to them, because¦64412 he knew what people are like.
\v 25 (He didn't need anyone¦64425 to tell him what people are like because he could see what any person¦64438 was like on the inside.)
\c 3
\s1 Jesus tells Nicodemus about the need to be reborn
\p
\v 1 One night a Jewish leader named Nicodemus who was a member of the Pharisee party¦64444
\v 2 came¦64453 to Jesus and said¦64461, “Teacher, we know that God has sent you as a teacher¦64469, because no one could do these¦64474 kinds of miracles if God wasn't with him.”
\p
\v 3 Jesus¦64493 responded, “I'll tell you frankly that no one can enter God's kingdom¦64511 unless he is reborn.”
\p
\v 4 Nicodemus questioned, “How could an adult be reborn? A person¦64521 can't just return to their¦64535 mother's¦64534 womb and¦64538 then get born again!”
\p
\v 5 And Jesus¦64543 continued, “Honestly, I'm telling¦64546 you¦64547: unless a person is born from both water¦64554 \em and¦64555\em* the spirit¦64556, they can't enter God's kingdom¦64564.
\v 6 Someone that's born from a body is flesh, but someone that's born from God's spirit is spiritual.
\v 7 So you shouldn't be surprised that I told you that everyone needs to be reborn.
\v 8 The wind blows wherever it wants, and you hear its sound¦64604 but you can't actually see where it's coming¦64611 from and where it's going¦64615. So too with everyone¦64618 born from God's spirit.”
\p
\v 9 Nicodemus replied, “How can all this even happen?”
\p
\v 10 And Jesus answered¦64636, “You're a Jewish teacher¦64645 and yet you¦64651 don't know all this?
\v 11 It's true that we just teach what we know, and explain what we've seen¦64663 ourselves, but you people aren't accepting our¦64668 testimony¦64667.
\v 12 If I tell you all earthly¦64674 things and you don't believe them, how will you ever believe if I explain \em heavenly¦64687\em* things?
\v 13 None of you have gone up into heaven, except¦64700 that I¦64710, mankind's child, have come down from heaven.
\p
\v 14 \x + \xo 3:14: \xt Num 21:9.\x*“Just like Moses lifted up that \add bronze\add* snake \add on a pole\add* in the wilderness¦64724, it's necessary for mankind's child to be lifted up,\f + \fr 3:14 \ft lifted up / exalted: See https://bibleDifferences.net/2019/04/25/156-exulted\f*
\v 15 so that everyone¦64736 who believes¦64738 in him¦64742 won't die, but will live forever.\f + \fr 3:15 \ft See http://bibleandtech.blogspot.com/2021/03/john-314-21-translation-and-commentary.html\f*
\p
\v 16 “Because in the same way, God loves the people of the world enough to cause his only son to be born and to give him¦64772 to the world, so that everyone¦64767 who believes¦64769 this will not die, but¦64776 will live forever.
\v 17 God didn't send his son here to condemn poeple, but¦64796 rather to save them.
\v 18 The one who trusts in me will not be condemned. However, the one who doesn't believe¦64817 this has already¦64813 been condemned because¦64815 he rejected the authority of the only son that God fathered.
\v 19 And this is the verdict: that light has come into the world¦64837, but some people¦64842 loved¦64839 the darkness¦64846 more than the light because they do evil things,
\v 20 because everyone¦64858 who does evil things hates the light and doesn't come to the light so that their actions won't be exposed.
\v 21 But whoever does what is right and true comes toward the light¦64890 so that their actions can be revealed¦64892 as being done with God's help.”
\s1 John approves of Jesus' popularity
\p
\v 22 After¦64903 this, Jesus¦64907 and his¦64915 followers¦64914 went down to Judea¦64918, and stayed there¦64922 and immersed¦64927 some believers.
\v 23 John was also immersing¦64933 people at Aenon near Salim because¦64940 there was plenty of water¦64941 there and people would come to get immersed¦64948.
\v 24 \x + \xo 3:24: \xt Mat 14:3; Mrk 6:17; Luk 3:19-20.\x*(At this time, John¦64957 had not yet been put in prison¦64955.)
\v 25 Then a debate¦64961 about¦64971 purification¦64972 started between John's followers¦64965 and a religious leader.\f + \fr 3:25 \ft https://www.billmounce.com/monday-with-mounce/what-does-the-word-%E2%80%9Cjew%E2%80%9D-mean-you-john-3-25\f*
\v 26 So they came to John and said, “Teacher, that man that came to you across the river and that you testified¦64995 about, now \em he's\em* immersing¦64999 people and so they're all going to him.”
\p
\v 27 John answered¦65005, “None¦65011 of us get anything if it's not being given¦65023 from heaven¦65027.
\v 28 \x + \xo 3:28: \xt Jn 1:20.\x*You yourselves know that I said¦65033 that I'm not the messiah¦65040, but¦65041 rather the one coming before¦65045 him.
\v 29 It's the groom that has the bride¦65051—the best man is happy because¦65068 he sees that the groom is happy. So I'm actually completely happy with all this.
\v 30 It's right and proper that he should increase¦65083 and I should fade out.”
\p
\v 31 “The one who came down from heaven is greater than any of us. We came from this world and speak¦65109 in our worldly ways. The one who came down from heaven is greater than any of us.
\v 32 He explains about what he's seen¦65122 and¦65123 heard¦65124, but¦65127 people don't believe him¦65130.
\v 33 Whoever does believe him¦65135, confirms that God is true.
\v 34 The one that God sent¦65148 tells us God's words, because God doesn't ration his spirit¦65165.
\v 35 \x + \xo 3:35: \xt Mat 11:27; Luk 10:22.\x*The father¦65167 loves the son and has put him¦65178 in charge of everything.
\v 36 Whoever believes¦65181 \add God's\add* son will live forever, but whoever disobeys the son won't be seeing¦65196 life, but will feel God's severe¦65200 anger¦65200.”

\s1 Jesus chats with a woman at the well
\p
\v 1 When Jesus found out that the Pharisee party¦65216 knew¦65209 that he was gaining and immersing¦65223 more followers¦65220 than John had,
\v 2 (although actually it wasn't Jesus¦65228 himself¦65229 that was immersing¦65232 them, but¦65233 his¦65236 trainees were doing it),
\v 3 he¦65237 left Judea¦65239 and¦65241 went¦65242 back up to Galilee¦65246.
\v 4 On the way up, he¦65252 decided to go through Samaria¦65253.
\p
\v 5 \x + \xo 4:5: \xt Gen 33:19; Josh 24:32.\x*Because of that, they came to a town in Samaria¦65259 called¦65260 Sukar, which¦65265 was near the place Joseph had inherited from his¦65273 father Jacob,
\v 6 and Jacob's well was there¦65276. Jesus¦65282 was tired from all the walking and was sitting¦65288 at the well around midday.
\p
\v 7 A woman¦65304 came from the town to get water¦65309 from the well, and Jesus¦65313 asked her¦65311 for a drink¦65316
\v 8 since his¦65321 followers¦65320 had gone into the town to buy some lunch.
\p
\v 9 \x + \xo 4:9: \xt Ist 4:1-5; Neh 4:1-2.\x*The woman said to him, “You're a Jew. How come you're asking me for a drink¦65344 when I'm from Samaria?” (Jews don't normally associate¦65355 with anyone from Samaria.)
\p
\v 10 Jesus¦65361 answered¦65359, “If you had recognised God's gift¦65368 and who it is who's asking you for a drink¦65379, you would have asked me and I would have given you \em living¦65390\em* water¦65389.”
\p
\v 11 But the woman¦65396 countered, “Mister, you don't even have \add rope and\add* a bucket¦65400 to reach the water in the deep well. How then could you get living¦65420 water?
\v 12 I doubt that you're greater¦65423 than our¦65428 ancestor Jacob¦65429 who made this well for us, and drank¦65444 this water along with his children and his animals.”
\p
\v 13 Jesus¦65455 responded, “Everyone¦65460 who drinks¦65462 this water¦65465 will get thirsty¦65467 again¦65468,
\v 14 but whoever¦65469 drinks¦65474 the water that I give them will find a well springing up inside them—springing into eternal¦65507 life¦65506.”
\p
\v 15 The woman¦65512 said, “Ok. Give me some of that water¦65518 so that I won't get thirsty¦65521 and won't have to keep coming out here to the well.”
\p
\v 16 Jesus said, “First, go and get your¦65541 husband¦65540 and return here.”
\p
\v 17 But she retorted, “I don't have a husband!”
\p And Jesus¦65559 said, “True enough—indeed you don't.
\v 18 You've had five¦65568 husbands¦65570 and you're not married to the man you're living with, so that was true.”
\p
\v 19 The woman¦65588 reacted, “Mister, I can see that you're a prophet¦65592.
\v 20 Our¦65597 ancestors worshipped on this mountain¦65601, but you¦65605 Jews claim that people should only worship there in Jerusalem.”
\p
\v 21 Then Jesus¦65620 told her, “You need to believe¦65622 that I was sent from God, woman¦65625, because¦65626 a day is coming¦65627 when everyone will be worshipping¦65642 him neither¦65631 on this mountain¦65635, nor in Jerusalem.
\v 22 You people in Samaria don't even know who you¦65649 worship, but we do, because¦65654 people will be saved by means of us Jews.
\v 23 But a time is coming¦65662, starting even now, when the true worshippers will be worshipping the father in spirit¦65675 and truth¦65677, because those are the ones that he is wanting to worship him.
\v 24 God is spirit, and the ones worshipping him must worship in spirit and total honesty.”
\p
\v 25 The woman¦65710 said, “I'm aware that the messiah is coming¦65715—the chosen one of God. Whenever he appears, he'll teach us everything.”
\p
\v 26 And Jesus responded, “I am the messiah. Yes, he's speaking¦65734 to you¦65735!”
\p
\v 27 After this, his¦65745 followers¦65744 arrived back, and they were astounded that he was speaking with a woman¦65751. However no one dared ask her, “What are you after¦65737?” Or to ask him, “Why are you talking with her?”
\p
\v 28 So the woman¦65776 left her¦65773 water¦65772 jar there, and went¦65778 back into the town where she told the people¦65785,
\v 29 “Come and see¦65787 a man¦65788 who knew as much about me as I know myself! He must be the messiah¦65801!”
\v 30 So they¦65809 went out from the town to go and¦65808 see Jesus.
\p
\v 31 Meanwhile, Jesus' followers¦65822 encouraged him¦65820, “Teacher, here, eat.”
\p
\v 32 But he¦65827 said¦65829, “I've had food to eat¦65834 that you¦65836 don't know about.”
\p
\v 33 This made his followers¦65846 ask each other, “Did you see anyone¦65850 bring him¦65852 something¦65852 to eat¦65853?”
\p
\v 34 And Jesus¦65857 explained, “Obeying God who sent¦65867 me is like food to me, and¦65869 I plan to finish his¦65871 work.
\v 35 Don't you all have a saying about needing to wait four¦65879 months¦65879 for a harvest? But I'm telling you that you all should open your¦65893 eyes¦65892 and look at the fields¦65897, because¦65898 they're already¦65903 colouring with the coming¦65885 harvest.
\v 36 The harvester gets paid with a harvest that will last forever so that the ones who plant and the ones who harvest can all celebrate.
\v 37 There's truth in the statement¦65933 that one person plants and¦65942 a different person harvests.
\v 38 I've sent¦65947 you all out to harvest where you haven't worked before—others¦65956 did the groundwork and you benefit from their¦65964 work.”
\p
\v 39 And many people of Samaria¦65976 came out of that town and believed¦65972 that Jesus is God because¦65977 the woman¦65981 had told them that he knew everything about her¦65966.
\v 40 So¦65998 when they all came¦65994, they asked him to stay in their town, and so they stayed on there¦66011 for a couple of days¦66013.
\p
\v 41 And many more believed¦66019 as a result of his¦66023 teaching,
\v 42 so they told the woman, “We no longer¦66034 believe¦66041 just because¦66035 of what you said, but now that we've heard¦66045 him for ourselves¦66042, we can see that he really is the saviour¦66057 of the world¦66059.”
\s1 Jesus heals the official's son
\p
\v 43 After his two¦66065 days¦66066 in Samaria, Jesus continued on up to Galilee¦66073.
\v 44 \x + \xo 4:44: \xt Mat 13:57; Mrk 6:4; Luk 4:24.\x*He¦66077 himself¦66074 said that no prophet¦66080 gets honoured¦66085 in his own home town¦66084.
\v 45 \x + \xo 4:45: \xt Jn 2:23.\x* When he got to Galilee¦66094, the people accepted him, having¦66101 seen¦66101 everything that he'd done at the feast in Jerusalem because they had also been there.
\p
\v 46 \x + \xo 4:46: \xt Jn 2:1-11.\x*So he went again¦66128 to Cana there in Galilee¦66139 where¦66140 he had made the water¦66144 into wine. And there was a royal¦66151 official¦66151 there, whose¦66152 son in Capernaum was ill.
\v 47 When the official heard¦66159 that Jesus¦66162 was coming¦66163 up from Judea to Galilee¦66170, he went¦66171 and asked him if he would come¦66180 and heal¦66183 his¦66184 son who was dying¦66190.
\v 48 Jesus¦66194 said¦66191 to him¦66196, “You people won't believe¦66206 unless you see¦66203 miracles and other marvels.”
\p
\v 49 But the official¦66212 begged him¦66209, “Sir¦66213, please come¦66215 before¦66216 my¦66223 child¦66220 dies.”
\p
\v 50 Jesus responded, “Go back there and see. Your¦66231 son will recover.”
\p The man¦66236 believed¦66234 what Jesus had told him, and so he started off.
\v 51 On his way, his slaves¦66256 met him and reported¦66263 that the boy¦66270 was alive and well.
\p
\v 52 So the official inquired¦66274 what time it was that he got better¦66285, and they replied that the fever¦66301 had subsided around 1pm.
\v 53 The father¦66305 knew¦66302 that that was the time when Jesus had told him that his son would recover, and as a result his whole¦66330 household¦66328 believed¦66324 \add that Jesus came from God\add*.
\p
\v 54 This was the second¦66336 miracle that Jesus¦66341 did after leaving Judea and going to Galilee¦66348.
\c 5
\s1 Jesus heals a man at the pool
\p
\v 1 After¦66349 all this, there¦66351 was another Jewish feast¦66353, so Jesus¦66359 went¦66357 down to Jerusalem.
\v 2 In Jerusalem at the Sheep Gate, there's¦66362 the Bethsaida pool that has five¦66384 alcoves
\v 3 and a large number of sick, blind¦66396, lame, and paralysed¦66398 people lie there in them.
\v 4 ≈
\v 5 One man¦66441 had been there¦66442 for thirty-eight¦66445 years¦66448,
\v 6 and when Jesus¦66458 noticed him and knew that he'd been there for so long, he asked, “Do you want to get better?”
\p
\v 7 The sick man answered¦66475, “Yes mister, but¦66500 when the water¦66489 starts moving, I don't have a companion to lift me into the pool, so someone else always get there before¦66504 me.”
\p
\v 8 Then Jesus¦66511 said, “Stand up and pick up your¦66519 bedroll and start walking¦66521.”
\v 9 The man immediately¦66523 stood up, picked up his¦66538 gear, and started to walk.
\p However, this was the weekly rest day.
\v 10 \x + \xo 5:10: \xt Neh 13:19; Jer 17:21.\x*So the religious leaders said to the man, “Hey! It's against the law for you to carry your¦66567 bedding on the rest day¦66556!”
\p
\v 11 But the man answered¦66571, “The person who made me better told me to pick up my bedroll and¦66590 start walking¦66591.”
\p
\v 12 “Oh. Who was it that told you¦66602 to take that stuff and¦66608 start walking¦66609?”
\p
\v 13 But the man who had been healed¦66613 didn't even know who it was, because when a crowd¦66626 had formed, Jesus¦66623 had quickly left.
\p
\v 14 Later on, Jesus¦66638 found the man in the temple¦66643 and told him, “Look, you're better now, so don't sin because you don't want anything worse¦66655 to happen to you.”
\p
\v 15 The man¦66665 then went¦66661 and¦66666 told the leaders that it was Jesus¦66677 who had made him¦66682 better.
\v 16 As a result, the leaders started harassing Jesus¦66694 because he had done this on a rest day¦66706.
\v 17 But Jesus just replied, “My¦66716 father¦66715 is working today, and¦66720 so I'm also working.”
\p
\v 18 Because of this, the leaders became determined that he must be put to death, not just because he broke the rules for the rest day¦66739, but especially because he was calling¦66744 God his¦66739 own father¦66742, thus making¦66750 himself¦66749 equal¦66748 to God!
\s1 Authority over life is given to the son
\p
\v 19 So Jesus¦66757 responded to them, “I want to tell you all something: The son can't initiate anything¦66789 by himself¦66780. He can only do what he sees his father doing, because whatever¦66796 his father is doing, he also does things¦66804 like that.
\v 20 You see, the father¦66813 loves his son and shows him everything that he's doing¦66826. In fact, he'll be showing him even greater¦66829 things than what he's done already, so that you all will be amazed.
\v 21 Because the father¦66845 brings the dead back to life, giving them new life, so also the son can give life to whoever he wants.
\v 22 The father¦66866 won't be judging¦66867 anyone, but¦66869 has already given¦66873 that task to the son,
\v 23 so that the people might honour the son like they honour the father. But any who is not honouring the son, is also dishonouring the father who sent him.
\p
\v 24 “I assure you that whoever hears my¦66906 message¦66905 and believes¦66909 that I was sent by God, will live forever and will not be condemned, but has moved from death¦66927 into life.
\v 25 I can also assure you¦66934 that a time is coming¦66936, and in fact is here already, when the dead¦66943 will be hearing¦66946 the voice of the son of God and that voice will bring them back to life.
\v 26 As the the father¦66962 is the source of life, he gave the power of giving life to the son
\v 27 and gave¦66985 him the authority¦66983 to be the final judge, because¦66991 he is mankind's child.
\v 28 Don't be surprised at this, because¦66998 a time is coming¦66999 when everyone in their¦67017 graves will be hearing¦67014 his¦67017 voice¦67016,
\v 29 \x + \xo 5:29: \xt Dan 12:2.\x*and the ones having done what is good¦67024 will be given new life¦67028, and the ones having done what is evil¦67033 will be condemned.
\s1 The unbelief of the religious leaders
\p
\v 30 Jesus continued explaining to the religious leaders, “I don't do anything in isolation. As I hear from him, only then do I judge and my judgement is correct and impartial because¦67061 I'm not imposing my desires, but the desire of the one who sent¦67073 me.
\p
\v 31 “If I just testify¦67078 about myself¦67080, my¦67083 testimony¦67082 would not be correct or even valid.
\v 32 But it's another one that's testifying¦67100 about me, and¦67093 I know that his testimony¦67100 about me is true.
\v 33 \x + \xo 5:33: \xt Jn 1:19-27; 3:27-30.\x*You sent¦67107 people out to question John¦67109 and¦67110 his testimony¦67111 was true.
\v 34 But I don't even need testimony¦67122 that comes from people, because I am teaching you¦67128 how to be saved¦67129.
\v 35 John was a bright and shining¦67137 light¦67147 and you¦67138 appreciated it for a short time.
\v 36 But I have a stronger testimony¦67153 than John's because the father has entrusted works to me to complete¦67170, and which I'm already doing¦67178 and which clearly show that the father sent me here.
\v 37 \x + \xo 5:37: \xt Mat 3:17; Mrk 1:11; Luk 3:22.\x*And since he sent¦67192 me, he himself has testified¦67198 about me. You people have never listened to his¦67203 voice¦67202, nor have you ever seen¦67211 him!
\v 38 And his¦67215 way of thinking is obviously not in your minds, because¦67222 you don't believe¦67230 the one that he sent¦67224.
\v 39 You look in the Jewish scriptures because¦67234 you suppose¦67236 that they'll lead you to eternal¦67241 life¦67240. Those very scriptures testify¦67250 about me coming,
\v 40 yet you refuse to come¦67256 to me in order¦67259 to receive life¦67260.
\p
\v 41 “I'm not getting any praise from people
\v 42 but I do know that you people don't actually love¦67276 God in your hearts.
\v 43 I have come in my¦67292 father's¦67291 name and you don't accept me, but if someone came in their¦67292 own name, you'd happily accept them.
\v 44 How \em could\em* you possibly believe¦67310 when you just accept acclamations from each other, but don't even seek praise from the only \add God\add*.
\v 45 But don't be assuming that I'll be accusing you all in front of the father¦67337. No, the one who'll accuse you is Moses because he's the one that you're hoping you'll please.
\v 46 The trouble is that if you actually believed what Moses wrote¦67362, you would believe me, because Moses was writing about me.
\v 47 But since you don't really believe his writings¦67368, you're not at all likely to believe me.”
\c 6
\s1 The feeding of 5,000 families
\r (Mat. 14:13-21; Mrk. 6:30-44; Luk. 9:10-17)
\p
\v 1 After¦67379 all this, Jesus crossed the lake \add in a boat\add*.\f + \fr 6:1 \ft Here John also uses the Roman name “Lake Tiberias” rather than just “Lake Galilee”.\f*
\v 2 A large crowd¦67398 followed¦67395 him¦67397 because¦67401 they¦67404 had seen his miraculous healings of sick people.
\v 3 Jesus¦67424 climbed a hill and¦67425 sat there¦67426 with his¦67433 apprentices¦67432.
\v 4 At that time, it was getting close to the Jewish Feast of Passover.
\v 5 When Jesus¦67452 looked out and¦67453 saw the large crowd coming¦67459, he¦67462 asked Philip, “Where can we¦67467 get enough food from to feed all this crowd?”
\v 6 But he was only saying¦67478 this to test Philip because he already knew what he was going¦67486 to do.
\p
\v 7 Philip answered¦67489, “It would take quite a few months wages to buy even just a snack for this many people.”
\p
\v 8 Now one of Jesus' apprentices¦67513, Simon Peter's brother¦67517, Andrew¦67515, said to Jesus,
\v 9 “There's a boy¦67521 here with five¦67527 buns and¦67530 two¦67531 small cooked fish¦67532, but¦67533 that wouldn't even start to feed this crowd.”
\p
\v 10 But Jesus¦67544 told them to get all the people¦67547 to sit¦67548 down as there¦67549 was a large grassy¦67552 area. So they all sat¦67558 down—some five¦67569 thousand¦67569 men¦67563 were counted.
\v 11 Then he took the buns and gave¦67579 thanks¦67579 to God, and started passing around both the buns and the fish¦67597, and everyone ate as much as they wanted.
\v 12 Once everyone was full, Jesus got his¦67606 apprentices¦67605 to collect the left-over fragments¦67611 so as not to waste anything¦67614.
\v 13 So they gathered¦67618 the left-overs and filled¦67622 twelve¦67626 baskets¦67627 with left-over bread.
\p
\v 14 The people¦67642 who had witnessed this and other miracles said, “This really is the prophet¦67658 that God promised to send!”
\v 15 But Jesus¦67665 knew that they intended to come and grab him to announce him as their king¦67679, so he moved out of the crowd and on up the hill.
\s1 Jesus comes walking across the lake
\r (Mat. 14:22-33; Mrk. 6:45-52)
\p
\v 16 As it¦67694 moved into evening¦67693, Jesus' apprentices¦67697 went back down to the lake
\v 17 and having¦67704 boarded¦67704 the boat¦67707, they¦67708 set out across¦67712 the lake toward Capernaum. By then it was dark, and there was still no sign of Jesus¦67737.
\v 18 Then a strong wind hit the lake and the water got rough.
\v 19 When they had rowed¦67747 about¦67751 five¦67756 kilometres, they saw Jesus¦67761 walking¦67762 on top of the lake and approaching the boat¦67771, and they were very scared.
\v 20 But he told them, “Don't worry—it's me.”
\v 21 After that they were willing¦67785 to let him into the boat, and immediately¦67795 the boat was at their arrival place.
\p
\v 22 The next day, the crowd¦67813 looked across¦67817 the lake and saw that only one small boat had crossed, and they knew that only Jesus' apprentices had boarded that boat and left, and not Jesus himself.
\v 23 Other boats¦67874 came¦67872 across from Tiberias¦67881 near the place¦67885 where¦67886 they¦67888 had eaten the bread¦67890 after the Master had given¦67891 thanks¦67891.
\v 24 So when all the people saw¦67897 that Jesus wasn't around and his¦67912 apprentices¦67911 had left, they went off looking for Jesus in Capernaum.
\s1 The bread that enables true life
\p
\v 25 When they found¦67934 him there across¦67936 the lake, they queried, “Teacher¦67942, when did you come¦67947 here?”
\p
\v 26 And Jesus¦67951 answered¦67948, “Honestly, I know that you're looking for me, not because you saw¦67962 miracles, but because you all had plenty of food to fill you up.
\v 27 Don't \add just\add* work for the food which goes off, but¦67982 for the food which lasts forever, which mankind's child will give to you¦67996 because God the father¦68001 has put his mark of approval on Acts”
\p
\v 28 Puzzled, they asked him¦68008, “What should we be doing if we want to do God's work?”
\p
\v 29 He answered, “Doing God's work is putting your trust in the one that He sent¦68041 here.”
\p
\v 30 “If so,” they said¦68044, “what miracle will you do for us to see¦68057 so that we can believe¦68059 in you? What can you do?
\v 31 \x + \xo 6:31: \xt Exo 16:4,15; Psa 78:24.\x*Our¦68065 ancestors ate¦68068 the manna¦68067 out in the wilderness¦68071, as Moses wrote, ‘He gave¦68080 them bread¦68076 from heaven¦68079 to eat¦68083.’ ”
\p
\v 32 Jesus¦68088 said to them, “Actually I can tell you that it wasn't Moses who gave¦68095 them bread from heaven, but my¦68106 father¦68105 gives you the real bread from heaven,
\v 33 because the bread¦68119 of God is the one who came down from heaven¦68128 and¦68129 who gives life¦68130 to the world¦68135.”
\p
\v 34 So they¦68136 requested, “Mister¦68140, always¦68141 give¦68143 us that bread¦68146.”
\p
\v 35 But Jesus¦68153 answered, “\em I am\em* the bread¦68157 that gives life¦68159—whoever comes to me will never hunger¦68167, and¦68170 the one believing¦68172 in me, will never be thirsty¦68177 again.
\v 36 But as I said¦68182 already, although you have seen¦68186 me you refuse to believe¦68191 me.
\v 37 Everyone¦68193 that the father¦68198 gives to me will come to me, and¦68202 I certainly won't turn away anyone who comes to me,
\v 38 because I came¦68214 down from heaven¦68218, not to do what I want, but¦68227 to do what the one who sent¦68231 me wants.
\v 39 And what He wants is for me to not lose any that he's given¦68246 to me, but¦68254 to bring them back to life on the last day¦68262.
\v 40 My¦68275 father¦68272 wants everyone¦68277 who watches me and believes¦68283 in me to live forever, because I will bring them back to life¦68289 on that last day¦68299.”
\p
\v 41 This little speech made the religious leaders grumble¦68300 about¦68305 him because¦68307 he had said¦68308 that he was the food that came down from heaven¦68317,
\v 42 as they figured out, “This is Jesus the son of Joseph and so we know his¦68331 parents. So how can he say that he come down from heaven¦68353?”
\p
\v 43 Jesus¦68359 scolded them, “Don't be grumbling¦68365 to each other.
\v 44 No one can join me unless the father¦68377 who sent¦68380 me attracts them, and¦68386 then I'll be bringing them back to life on the last day¦68394.”
\v 45 \x + \xo 6:45: \xt Isa 54:13.\x*The prophets¦68399 wrote that the people will be taught¦68403 by God. And everyone who's heard¦68410 and¦68414 learned¦68415 from the father¦68413 comes to me.
\v 46 Not that any person has seen the father—only the one who came from God has seen Acts
\v 47 I tell you¦68446 sincerely: the one who believes¦68449 \add in me\add* will live forever.
\v 48 I am the bread¦68458 that gives true life¦68460.
\v 49 Your¦68463 ancestors ate¦68464 manna¦68473 in the wilderness¦68471, but they¦68475 all went on to die.
\v 50 I am the bread¦68479 that came down from heaven¦68483 and¦68493 whoever eats this will not die¦68496.
\v 51 I am the living bread that came down from heaven¦68507 and if anyone¦68511 eats this bread, he will live through to the next age.”
\p
\v 52 At this point, the religious leaders began to argue with each other, “How could this man give¦68562 us his¦68568 flesh¦68565 to eat¦68569?”
\p
\v 53 So Jesus explained, “Indeed if you don't eat¦68583 my flesh¦68585 and drink¦68592 my blood¦68596, you aren't truly¦68576 alive!
\v 54 The person who eats my flesh¦68613 and drinks¦68616 my blood¦68620 will gain eternal¦68623 life—I will bring them back to life on the last day¦68632.
\v 55 For my flesh¦68635 is the true food, and¦68641 my blood¦68643 is the true drink¦68648.
\v 56 Whoever eats my flesh¦68687 and drinks¦68689 my blood¦68693 lives in me, and I will live in him¦68699.
\v 57 The father is alive and sent me here, and I am alive because of Him, so also the person who eats me will be alive because of me.
\v 58 Unlike your ancestors who ate that bread and then died, whoever eats this bread that came down from heaven¦68763 will live through to the next age.”
\s1 Many people find the teaching too difficult
\p
\v 59 Jesus taught all of this in the meeting hall there in Capernaum¦68797.
\v 60 But even many of Jesus followers¦68804 who heard¦68801 it said¦68807, “This is difficult teaching—it's too hard to take.”
\p
\v 61 But Jesus¦68827 already knew inside that his¦68838 followers¦68837 were grumbling¦68833 about¦68834 this and asked them, “Do you¦68844 find this offensive¦68845?
\v 62 What¦68855 if you were to see mankind's child ascending to where¦68858 he came from?
\v 63 It's the spirit that is the source of life, not the body. The concepts that I've taught you are all spiritual and life-giving.
\v 64 But there¦68887 are some here who don't believe me.” Actually, Jesus had already known¦68899 from the beginning¦68903 just who would believe and¦68912 which person would betray him¦68920.
\v 65 So he said¦68926, “That's why I told you that no one can come¦68931 to me unless the father¦68943 has given¦68939 them to me.”
\p
\v 66 After this, many of his¦68951 followers¦68952 went¦68954 back and no longer¦68959 accompanied him around.
\p
\v 67 So Jesus¦68968 said¦68964 to the twelve¦68970, “Don't you also want to leave?”
\p
\v 68 \x + \xo 6:68-69: \xt Mat 16:16; Mrk 8:29; Luk 9:20.\x*Simon answered¦68976, “Master, if we went, who would we follow then? you're the \add only\add* one who teaches about living forever.
\v 69 We believe¦68993 and¦68994 know that you¦68998 are the holy son of God.”
\p
\v 70 Jesus¦69012 responded, “Didn't I choose all twelve¦69023 of you myself? And yet one of you is a devil¦69031.”
\v 71 (He was talking about Judas, son of Simon Iscariot, because he was the one who would go on to betray him.)
\c 7
\s1 Jesus' sceptical brothers dare him to go public
\p
\v 1 After all this, Jesus¦69062 travelled around Galilee¦69067. (He didn't want to travel around Judea because¦69077 the leaders there wanted to execute him¦69079.)
\v 2 \x + \xo 7:2: \xt Lev 23:34; Deu 16:13.\x*As it¦69083 was now getting close to the Jewish Feast with Tents,
\v 3 his¦69100 brothers¦69099 said¦69093 to him, “You should leave this place and go down to Judea so that all your¦69115 followers¦69114 can see the miracles that you're doing¦69125.
\v 4 You don't do things¦69143 out of the main stream if you want to become well-known. If you want to do miracles, show yourself¦69146 to the wider world¦69148.
\v 5 (You see, not even Jesus' own \add half-\add*brothers believed¦69155 \add that he¦69152 came from God\add*.)
\p
\v 6 So Jesus responded, “Well, you guys can do that any time, but it's not the right time for me yet.
\v 7 All the people won't hate you¦69189 guys, but¦69191 they do hate me because¦69193 I teach about the evil¦69203 things they are doing.
\v 8 You all go¦69206 down to Jerusalem ahead of me. I'm not going¦69215 to the feast yet because¦69220 it's not yet the right time¦69225 for me.”
\v 9 After saying this, Jesus stayed up in Galilee¦69240.
\s1 Jesus starts teaching about authentic justice
\p
\v 10 But after his¦69247 \add half-\add*brothers had left to go down to Jerusalem, Jesus also went—not in the public limelight but just incognito so to speak.
\v 11 However at the celebrations, the Jewish religious leaders were searching for him, and were asking around where he was.
\p
\v 12 Even among¦69285 the crowds¦69288 there¦69283 was a lot of quiet banter with some saying that Jesus is a good man and others¦69297 complaining that he was misleading the people.
\v 13 Either way, no one was speaking¦69309 out in public¦69308 about him¦69312, because¦69315 they were afraid of the reaction of the religious leaders.
\p
\v 14 Finally sometime in the middle¦69324 of the celebrations, Jesus¦69329 went¦69326 into the temple¦69332 and¦69333 started teaching¦69334 in there.
\v 15 Even the Jewish leaders were surprised, asking, “How can this man know so much when he¦69338 hasn't been trained as a teacher?”
\p
\v 16 Jesus himself responded, “My¦69351 teaching¦69356 doesn't come from me, but¦69360 from the one who sent¦69362 me.
\v 17 If anyone¦69365 wants to do God's will, they'll soon figure out whether¦69376 my teaching¦69375 comes from God, or if I'm just making it¦69381 up myself¦69385.
\v 18 Any person who just teaches his own thoughts is just seeking their own advancement, but¦69398 whoever wants to promote the one who sent¦69403 them, this is authentic and¦69408 there's no hidden self-interest.
\v 19 Didn't Moses write down God's commandments for you, yet not a single one of you obeys them. Why are you wanting to execute me?”
\p
\v 20 “You must be demon-possessed¦69438,” said some in the crowd¦69435, “Who would be wanting to execute you¦69441.”
\p
\v 21 Jesus¦69447 responded, “I did one miracle and you¦69457 were all amazed.
\v 22 \x + \xo 7:22: a \xt Lev 12:3; \xo b \xt Gen 17:10.\x*Moses gave¦69462 you the commandment about circumcision (even though it actually came from before his¦69470 time), but to obey this, you'll even circumcise a baby boy on the Rest Day.
\v 23 \x + \xo 7:23: \xt Jn 5:9.\x*So if a male can be circumcised¦69486 on the Rest Day so that Moses' commandments aren't broken¦69494, they why did you get angry¦69501 with me because¦69502 I made a man healthy¦69506 of the Rest Day?
\v 24 Don't just judge things so you yourselves look good, but¦69515 judge impartially, seeking the best for others.”
\s1 Could Jesus be the messiah?
\p
\v 25 After this, some of the locals from Jerusalem started asking, “Isn't this the man they¦69531 were wanting to execute?
\v 26 Here he is teaching in public¦69535, yet they're not even confronting him. Perhaps¦69543 the leaders know that this really is the messiah¦69555?
\v 27 But we¦69558 even know where this man is from. Surely when the messiah¦69564 comes, no one would know his family background.”
\p
\v 28 So as Jesus continued teaching¦69591, he called out, “Indeed you all know me and my home and family. But I didn't come¦69609 here of my own accord, but the one who sent¦69615 me here is truthful, even though you don't even know him.
\v 29 I know him, because¦69625 I came from him, indeed, he was the one who sent¦69632 me here.”
\p
\v 30 So now they really want to arrest¦69639 him, but no one touched him because¦69651 it was not yet the proper time.
\v 31 Many in the crowd¦69665 did believe¦69668 that he was from God, and they were saying¦69672, “When the messiah¦69676 comes, would he do greater miracles than what we've seen this man¦69687 do?”
\s1 Jesus discusses leaving as they aim to arrest him
\p
\v 32 The Pharisee party heard¦69690 the crowd¦69695 muttering about these¦69700 things¦69700 and sent¦69702 out some of their servants along with the chief¦69706 priests¦69706 to go and arrest¦69714 Jesus.
\v 33 So Jesus¦69721 said¦69716, “I'll only be with you¦69727 all for a short while longer and¦69729 then I'll be going¦69730 to the one who sent¦69733 me.
\v 34 You'll look for me but won't be able to find me, and you aren't able to go where¦69743 I'll be going.”
\p
\v 35 The leaders wondered, “Where¦69759 could he be going that we wouldn't be able to find him? Will he go and live with the Jews living among the Greeks and start teaching¦69779 the Greeks?
\v 36 And what does he mean about looking for him and not being able to find him, and not being able to go where¦69801 he goes?”
\s1 Jesus offers living water to the crowd
\p
\v 37 \x + \xo 7:37: \xt Lev 23:36.\x*On the final climax day¦69812 of the celebrations, Jesus stood¦69821 there and shouted, “Anyone who's thirsty¦69831, come here to me and drink¦69837.
\v 38 \x + \xo 7:38: \xt Eze 47:1; Zech 14:8.\x*Whoever¦69847 trusts me will have rivers of living¦69854 water¦69853 flowing¦69852 out from him¦69851 just like the scriptures¦69846 say.”
\v 39 He was talking about God's spirit that the ones who trust him would receive¦69866 in the future—not yet because¦69883 Jesus¦69885 hadn't been lifted up to heaven yet. 
\s1 The people are divided about Jesus
\p
\v 40 When some in the crowd¦69894 heard¦69898 his teaching, they¦69906 said, “He really is the \add coming\add* prophet¦69913.”
\v 41 Others¦69914 said, “He must be the messiah.”
\p But some pointed out, “The messiah won't come from Galilee¦69931.
\v 42 \x + \xo 7:42: \xt 2Sam 7:12; Mic 5:2.\x*Don't the scriptures¦69938 say that he'll be a descendant of King David and¦69946 that he'll come from David's town of Bethlehem?”
\v 43 And so the crowd¦69970 was divided about Jesus.
\v 44 Some \add of the servants\add* wanted to arrest¦69981 him, but decided to leave him alone \add for now\add*.
\s1 The leaders distrust Jesus and mock his followers
\p
\v 45 So when servants returned back to the chief¦70001 priests¦70001 and the Pharisees, they were asked, “Why haven't you¦70012 brought¦70012 him¦70015?”
\p
\v 46 They answered¦70016, “We've¦70027 never¦70023 heard anyone speak like he¦70020 does.”
\p
\v 47 The Pharisees asked them, “Don't tell us that you've also been taken in by him?
\v 48 None of our¦70054 leaders or any of us Pharisees believe¦70049 that he's from God.
\v 49 But all these people ignorant of the scriptures are bewitched.”
\p
\v 50 \x + \xo 7:50: \xt Jn 3:1-2.\x*Now Nicodemus (the one who had previously visited Jesus) spoke up,
\v 51 “Since when did our¦70097 rules allow us to judge a person¦70100 before we've even heard them out and¦70108 investigated what they're doing¦70112?”
\p
\v 52 But they sneered, “And do you come from Galilee as well? Look in the scriptures and you'll soon see¦70131 that no prophet¦70140 emerges out of Galilee.”

\s1 The two witnesses of Jesus' authenticity
\p
\v 12 \x + \xo 8:12: \xt Mat 5:14; Jn 9:5.\x*Because of this, Jesus told them, “\em I am\em* the light of the world¦70411—whoever follows¦70413 me won't walk in the darkness¦70422 but will have the light of life¦70429.”
\p
\v 13 \x + \xo 8:13: \xt Jn 5:31.\x*Some from the Pharisee party¦70434 argued, “You are testifying¦70438 about¦70436 yourself¦70437, so that testimony¦70440 is invalid.”
\p
\v 14 Jesus¦70447 responded, “Even when I am testifying¦70455 about¦70456 myself¦70457, my¦70464 testimony¦70463 is valid, because¦70467 I know where I came¦70470 from and where I'm going.
\v 15 You all are judging according¦70485 to your earthly values. I'm not judging anyone.
\v 16 But even if I was judging, my judgement would be correct, because¦70508 it wouldn't just be me judging, but also the father¦70519 who sent¦70517 me.
\v 17 \x + \xo 8:17: \xt Deu 19:15.\x*It's even written¦70527 in your¦70526 own laws that the testimony¦70534 of two¦70531 men¦70532 is valid.
\v 18 So that's me testifying about myself¦70543, plus the father¦70552 who sent¦70550 me also testifies about me.”
\p
\v 19 “And where is your¦70560 father?” they asked.
\p Jesus¦70563 answered¦70561 them, “You don't know either me nor my father. If you did know me, then you'd also know my father.”
\p
\v 20 He explained all this while he was teaching¦70596 in the treasury¦70595 part of the temple¦70599, but no one arrested¦70602 him because¦70604 the time for his¦70609 \add suffering\add* had not yet arrived.
\s1 You can't go where I'm going
\p
\v 21 So he continued, “I will be going away and all of you will be looking for me, but you'll all just die in your¦70628 sins and won't be able to go where¦70630 I'll be going.”
\p
\v 22 This puzzled the Jewish teachers, “Surely¦70642 he's not going to commit suicide! What else could he mean about ‘you can't go where I'm going to be going’?”
\p
\v 23 Jesus explained, “All of you¦70672 are from the world below¦70664, but I'm from the world above¦70670. You all are part of this world, but I'm not part of it.
\v 24 That's why I said that you'll be dying in your sins, because if you refuse to believe¦70699 that I am \add God\add*, you will indeed be dying in your sins.”
\p
\v 25 “So who are you?” they asked.
\p And he¦70726 answered, “Still just the same as I've been telling you from the beginning¦70727.
\v 26 I have a lot that I need to tell you¦70738 all and to judge many of your actions, because the one who sent¦70745 me is true, and it's what I hear from him¦70755 that I speak to all people.”
\p
\v 27 (They didn't realise that he was talking to them about¦70766 the father¦70767 \add in heaven\add*.)
\v 28 So Jesus¦70779 told them, “When you all lift up\f + \fr 8:28 \ft lifted up / exalted: There's a play on words here. See https://bibleDifferences.net/2019/04/25/156-exulted (dead link???)\f* mankind's child \add on a pole\add*, then you will know that I am \add God\add*, and I don't do anything by myself¦70796, but I say all this just as the father¦70808 told me to.
\v 29 And the one who sent¦70815 me is with me—he didn't just leave me alone¦70823—because¦70829 I am continually doing¦70834 what pleases¦70832 him.”
\p
\v 30 After he'd said all this, many people believed¦70840 in him.
\s1 Jesus teaches about freedom from slavery
\p
\v 31 Because of this, Jesus¦70846 told all the Jews who believed¦70849 in him¦70850, “If you all continue to believe¦70849 my message¦70858, then you're my true followers¦70863.
\v 32 You will have known the truth, and the truth will set you free.”
\p
\v 33 \x + \xo 8:33: \xt Mat 3:9; Luk 3:8.\x*But some queried, “We are Abraham's descendants and¦70884 we've never been slaves to anyone, so how can you¦70892 say that we'll be set free?”
\p
\v 34 And Jesus answered¦70898, “I can assure you all that anyone who sins is a slave¦70913 to sin.
\v 35 And the slaves¦70919 don't necessarily remain in the \add family\add* home forever—only the children have that right.
\v 36 So if the son sets you free, then you'll be truly free.
\s1 Jesus spars with the Jewish religious leaders
\p
\v 37 “Yes, I know that you're all descendants of Abraham, but you're trying to kill¦70959 me because¦70961 my message¦70963 doesn't lodge in you.
\v 38 Indeed I talk about what I've actually seen with the father, but you all are doing¦70998 what you've heard¦70989 from your father.”
\p
\v 39 But they retorted, “Abraham is our¦71007 father.”\f + \fr 8:39 \ft father meaning ancestor. (Abraham lived some 2,000 years before the time of these events.)\f*
\p And Jesus¦71016 responded, “Well, if you really were descendants of Abraham, you'd behave more like him¦71004.
\v 40 But instead you're trying to find a way to have me killed—to kill the man¦71035 who has spoken¦71040 the truth to you—truth that I heard¦71044 from God. Abraham never did that.
\v 41 you're doing¦71055 what your¦71060 father wants you all do to.”
\p But they shot back, “It's not us who was conceived by a couple that weren't even married! Anyway, we only have one father and that's God.”
\p
\v 42 Again Jesus¦71082 responded, “If God was your¦71090 father¦71088, you all would¦71093 be loving¦71092 me because I came¦71101 from God and for God. I didn't just come¦71111 by myself¦71109, but God sent¦71116 me here.
\v 43 Why can't you comprehend what I'm saying? The reason¦71118 that you can't stand listening to my message¦71132
\v 44 is because you come from your father, the devil¦71140, and you want to do what \em your\em* father wants. But he was a murderer¦71151 from the beginning¦71154, and doesn't stick to the truth because there's no truth in him. Whenever¦71169 he tells lies, he's speaking from his¦71145 own nature, because he's a liar and the source of lying.
\v 45 But because¦71186 I'm speaking¦71189 the truth¦71188, you¦71193 don't believe¦71193 in me.
\v 46 Which¦71196 of you can scold me for my sins? If I am speaking¦71207 the truth¦71206, why don't you believe¦71212 I'm from God?
\v 47 Anyone who belongs to God, listens to what God says. But you all can't even hear the message¦71220, because you don't belong to God.”
\s1 Jesus preceded, and is greater than, Abraham
\p
\v 48 The Jewish leaders asked, “Aren't we right¦71244 in saying¦71245 that you're from Samaria¦71250 and that you have a demon¦71254?”
\p
\v 49 “No, I don't have a demon¦71262,” Jesus answered¦71256, “but¦71265 I honour¦71266 my¦71270 father¦71269 and¦71271 you're dishonouring¦71273 me.
\v 50 But I'm not seeking greatness for myself—he is the one seeking and the one judging¦71286.
\v 51 I can assure you¦71290, that anyone¦71294 who puts my teaching into practice can be certain to avoid death¦71302 in \add this\add* age.”
\p
\v 52 The Jews said¦71311, “Now we \em know\em* that you have a demon¦71320! Abraham and the prophets¦71326 all died¦71323, but you're saying¦71329 that those who follow your¦71346 teaching can be certain to avoid death¦71346 in \add this\add* age.
\v 53 How could you be greater¦71352 than our¦71356 ancestor Abraham who died? Even the prophets¦71363 died. Who do you think you are?”
\p
\v 54 Again Jesus¦71372 answered¦71370, “If I praise myself¦71376, my praise is worthless, but it's my father¦71384 who praises me—the one who you¦71390 say is your¦71385 God
\v 55 although in fact you don't even know him. But I have known him, and so I can't say¦71409 that I haven't known him or I'd better a liar like all of you. But I have known him and I am putting his¦71428 desires into practice.
\v 56 Your¦71433 ancestor Abraham would have been excited to see me here—in fact he did see ahead and was very happy about it.”
\p
\v 57 Because of that, the Jewish leaders asked, “You aren't even fifty¦71453 years old yet. How could you have seen¦71460 Abraham?”\f + \fr 8:57 \ft Abraham lived some 2,000 years before Jesus.\f* 
\p
\v 58 Jesus answered, “I can assure you¦71472 that \em I am\em*\f + \fr 8:58 \ft This awkward English is necessary to catch the play on words, because ‘I am’ is the meaning of \em Yahweh\em*, the name of God.\f* before¦71473 Abraham ever existed.”
\p
\v 59 When they heard that, they picked up stones¦71481 to throw¦71483 at Jesus \add to kill him¦71485\add*. But Jesus was hidden¦71488 from their sight, and went on out of the temple¦71493.

\s1 A blind man obeys and then can see
\p
\v 1 As Jesus was walking along, he¦71505 saw¦71505 a man¦71506 who had been blind¦71507 from birth¦71509
\v 2 and his followers¦71515 asked¦71512 him, “Honoured teacher, why was this man¦71521 born blind¦71528? Was it because he himself sinned¦71520, or his parents¦71525?”
\p
\v 3 Jesus¦71533 answered¦71531, “It was neither this man¦71535 nor his¦71540 parents¦71539 who sinned¦71536, but it was so that God can work in him for others to see.
\v 4 As long as it's daytime, we need to do what the one who sent¦71559 us wants. When night¦71567 comes, no one will be able to work.

\v 6 After he'd said¦71584 this, Jesus spat on the ground¦71586 and after mixing some clay into a slurry, he spread¦71594 it on the eyes¦71603 of the man
\v 7 and told him¦71609, “Now go and wash in the Siloam Pool.”\f + \fr 9:7 \ft Siloam means ‘to be sent out’.\f*
\p
\v 8 Then the neighbours¦71632 of the man and others who had seen him earlier¦71639, knowing that he was a beggar¦71641 asked, “Isn't he the one who always sat and begged here?”
\p
\v 9 And indeed, some were saying, “Yes, this is him.” But others¦71657 were saying, “No, but he looks quite similar¦71664.”
\p And the man said, “I \em am\em* him.”
\p
\v 10 So they¦71673 asked him¦71680, “Well, how come you¦71686 can see now?”
\p
\v 11 “A man named Jesus made a slurry” he said, “and spread¦71701 it on my eyes and told me to go and wash at Siloam Pool. So I went and did it, and when I washed¦71724 my eyes, I could see.”
\p
\v 12 “Where¦71735 is he now?” they¦71731 asked.
\p “I don't know.” said¦71731 the man.
\s1 The Pharisees can't accept the healing of the blind man
\p
\v 13 Then they brought the man¦71750 who had been blind¦71750 to the Pharisees¦71747.
\v 14 Now, it¦71751 had been the Rest Day when Jesus¦71763 had made the slurry and¦71764 enabled him¦71768 to see,
\v 15 and because of this, some in the Pharisee party¦71778 asked him how it was that he could see now. And he answered, “Well, he put a slurry on my¦71789 eyes¦71793 and when I washed¦71796 them, I could see.”
\p
\v 16 So some of them said, “Clearly that man is not from God because¦71817 he doesn't respect the Rest Day.”
\p However others said, “But if he's just a sinner, how could he do miracles like that?”
\p
\v 17 So they asked the man who had been blind¦71845, “Well, what do you have to say because¦71856 it was your¦71859 eyes¦71861 that he opened¦71857?”
\p “He must be a prophet¦71866,” the man said.
\p
\v 18 But some of the Jews weren't even sure that he really had been blind¦71878 and could now see, so they called¦71884 for his¦71889 parents¦71888
\v 19 and asked¦71894 them, “You two say that this is your¦71904 son and that he was born blind¦71909. If so, how come he can see now?”
\p
\v 20 His¦71924 parents¦71923 answered¦71918, “We know that he's our¦71934 son, and we know that he was born blind¦71937.
\v 21 But as for how come he can now see, we don't know that. Nor do we know who healed his¦71950 eyes¦71953. But ask¦71964 him—he's old enough to speak¦71969 for himself¦71968.”
\v 22 (His¦71975 parents said these¦71970 things¦71970 because they were afraid of the Jewish religious leaders, because the leaders had already¦71980 announced that anyone¦71989 who said that Jesus was the messiah¦71993 would get banned from all religious services,
\v 23 so that's why they had said¦72002, “He's old enough—just ask¦72009 him.”)
\p
\v 24 So the leaders summoned the man born blind¦72023 a second¦72018 time and commanded him, “Only praise God himself for this, because we know that that man is a sinner¦72040.”
\p
\v 25 “Well, I don't know whether or not he's a sinner¦72048,” said the man. “All I know if that I used to be blind¦72056 but now I can see.”
\p
\v 26 They asked again, “What did he do to you? How did he open your¦72076 eyes¦72078?”
\p
\v 27 And he answered¦72083, “I already¦72087 told you that and you didn't even listen. Why do you want to hear it all again¦72093? Do you all want to become¦72105 his¦72102 followers¦72103 as well?”
\p
\v 28 Then they¦72109 insulted¦72109 him¦72111 and¦72112 said¦72114, “You might be a follower¦72117 of that man, but¦72123 we¦72121 are followers¦72127 of Moses.
\v 29 We know that God spoke¦72133 to Moses, but¦72144 we¦72146 don't even know where¦72147 this other fellow is from.”
\p
\v 30 The man responded, “Wow, that's pretty amazing. This man opened¦72174 up my¦72177 eyes¦72179, and you teachers don't even know where¦72170 he's from!
\v 31 We know that God doesn't listen to sinners¦72183, but he listens to those who worship him and do what he wants.
\v 32 In all the centuries we never heard¦72206 that a person could give sight to someone who was born blind¦72214.
\v 33 If this man¦72220 isn't from God, surely he¦72227 wouldn't be able to do that!”
\p
\v 34 They reacted, “You're just an ignorant sinner, and you think you can teach¦72247 <em>us</em>!” Then they had him thrown¦72250 out the door.
\s1 Spiritual blindness and hypocrisy
\p
\v 35 Jesus heard¦72255 that they had thrown¦72260 out the man who could now see, and when he found¦72265 him, he said¦72269, “Do you believe¦72272 that mankind's child \add came from God\add*?”
\p
\v 36 And the man answered¦72279, “Mister, who is he so that I can believe¦72290 in him?”
\p
\v 37 “You've seen¦72301 him and heard him and he's speaking¦72305 to you right now,” said Jesus¦72299.
\p
\v 38 And the man responded, “I do believe¦72315, master¦72316.” Then he knelt down in front of Jesus.
\p
\v 39 Jesus¦72324 said¦72322, “I came¦72334 into this world¦72332 to dispense judgement, so that the people who can't see will be able to see, and¦72341 so that the ones who can see will become¦72346 blind¦72345.”
\p
\v 40 The Pharisees with him heard¦72348 that and asked, “Are you saying that we're blind¦72367?”
\p
\v 41 “If you were blind¦72376,” Jesus¦72373 replied, “you wouldn't be sinning, but since you all declare that you can see, then your¦72396 sin remains¦72397.”
\c 10
\s1 The sheep know their true master
\p
\v 1 “Honestly I can tell you¦72402: It's not the person that enters the sheep¦72414 enclosure by the gate that is a thief¦72420 and¦72422 robber¦72423, but¦72415 rather the one who climbs in a different way¦72417.
\v 2 The one that comes in the gate is the shepherd¦72433 of the sheep¦72438.
\v 3 The gatekeeper opens up for him, and when he calls the sheep by name¦72461 they listen to his¦72449 voice¦72448 and he leads them out.
\v 4 Whenever¦72466 he moves the sheep, he goes in front and the sheep follow¦72480 him because¦72481 they recognise his¦72486 voice¦72485.
\v 5 They would never follow¦72491 a stranger¦72487 because¦72497 they wouldn't know his voice¦72503, in fact they'd run away from him¦72496.
\p
\v 6 Jesus¦72512 told them this illustration, but none of those¦72513 who heard it knew¦72517 what it meant.
\s1 Jesus is the good shepherd
\p
\v 7 So Jesus¦72531 continued, “Honestly I will tell you¦72535 that \em I am\em* the entrance for the sheep¦72545.
\v 8 The ones who came¦72548 before¦72549 me are thieves¦72552 and¦72554 robbers¦72555, but¦72556 the sheep¦72563 didn't listen to them.
\v 9 \em I am\em* the entrance. Anyone who comes in via me will be saved¦72575, and will be able to go in and out and find pasture¦72581.
\v 10 The thief¦72585 only comes to steal¦72593 and kill and destroy¦72597, but I came¦72600 so that they could live, and live a full life¦72602.
\p
\v 11 “\em I am\em* the good shepherd—the good shepherd gives his¦72622 own life¦72621 for the sheep¦72627.\f + \fr 10:11 \ft See http://bibleandtech.blogspot.com/2021/04/john-1011-18-translations-and-notes-rcl.html\f*
\v 12 The paid worker is not even the shepherd¦72635, because the sheep aren't his own and if he sees a wolf coming¦72649 he just abandons the sheep and takes off and the wolf scatters¦72662 the sheep and snatches¦72659 some—
\v 13 that's because¦72669 he's just a worker and doesn't really care about¦72678 the sheep¦72680.
\v 14 \em I am\em* the good¦72686 shepherd¦72684 and I know my \add sheep\add* and they know me,
\v 15 \x + \xo 10:15: \xt Mat 11:27; Luk 10:22.\x*just like the father knows me and I know the father—in fact I will give my¦72717 life for the sheep¦72723.
\v 16 I also have other sheep which¦72729 are not in this field¦72735 and it's appropriate for me to bring¦72742 those¦72737 other sheep also, then they'll be hearing¦72747 my¦72744 voice¦72745 because there'll be just one flock¦72753 with one shepherd¦72755.
\p
\v 17 The father¦72760 loves me because¦72763 I am laying¦72765 down my¦72768 life¦72767 so that I can receive it¦72772 again¦72770.
\v 18 No one is taking it from me, but I'm laying¦72782 it down myself¦72785. I have authority to lay it down, and also authority to receive it back again¦72795 because I received this command¦72801 from my¦72808 father¦72807.”
\p
\v 19 The Jewish religious leaders were again¦72811 divided about Jesus' teaching
\v 20 with many of them saying¦72820, “He's got a demon¦72828,” and, “He's stark raving¦72831 mad—why are you¦72835 all even listening to him¦72834!”
\p
\v 21 But others were saying¦72839, “He doesn't sound like he's demon-possessed. And how could a demon make a blind¦72853 man see?”
\s1 The Jewish leaders won't accept Jesus' teaching
\p
\v 22 By then it was winter¦72868 and the time for the Jewish Feast of Dedication in Jerusalem.
\v 23 Jesus was walking¦72872 in the temple¦72878 in an area known as Solomon's¦72883 Porch
\v 24 when he was surrounded¦72886 by the Jewish religious leaders and interrogated, “How long do you plan to keep us in suspense¦72901 for? If you are the messiah¦72906, tell us clearly.”
\p
\v 25 So Jesus¦72915 answered¦72912, “I already told you all but you didn't believe¦72921 me. The miracles that I do with the authority of my¦72935 father¦72934 testify¦72940 about me,
\v 26 but you don't believe¦72947 them either because¦72948 you aren't part of my¦72956 flock.
\v 27 My¦72967 sheep¦72962 listen to my¦72967 voice¦72966, and I know them and they¦72975 follow¦72975 after¦72976 me.
\v 28 I give them life¦72982 which will never end so they¦72987 won't ever be destroyed, and no one will be able to snatch¦72995 them away from me.
\v 29 My¦73005 father is the one who gave¦73009 them to me, and he's more powerful than any other, so no one can snatch¦73022 them away from him.
\v 30 The father¦73032 and¦73030 I are one.”
\p
\v 31 Again the Jewish leaders picked up rocks to throw at him to kill him.
\v 32 But Jesus¦73049 asked, “I showed¦73054 you all many miracles from my¦73061 father¦73060. Which miracle do you want to kill me for?”
\p
\v 33 \x + \xo 10:33: \xt Lev 24:16.\x*They answered¦73072, “It's not for any \em good¦73079\em* deed that we think you deserve to die, but because¦73088 you, a human¦73090, dishonour God by claiming to be him¦73074.”
\p
\v 34 \x + \xo 10:34: \xt Psa 82:6.\x*Jesus answered¦73096, “Isn't it¦73104 written¦73105 in your¦73113 scriptures that God said¦73116, ‘You all are gods¦73118’?”
\v 35 Now the scriptures¦73137 can't be wrong, and¦73132 if the ones who heard teaching from God were called¦73122 gods¦73123,
\v 36 why are you¦73147 telling the one that the father¦73140 blessed and¦73142 sent¦73143 out into the world¦73146 that I am insulting God because¦73151 I said¦73152 that I'm God's son?
\v 37 If I'm not doing¦73161 my¦73166 father's¦73165 work, then you don't need to believe¦73168 that he sent me,
\v 38 but if I am doing¦73172 his work, even if you don't believe that he sent me, at least believe in what I do so that you all can know that the father is in me and I'm in the father.”
\p
\v 39 That was enough that they tried yet again¦73210 to arrest¦73211 him, but he was able to get away from their¦73217 influence.
\p
\v 40 \x + \xo 10:40: \xt Jn 1:28.\x*Then Jesus crossed the Jordan river to the place¦73227 where¦73229 John had immersed¦73235 the people, and he stayed there¦73239.
\v 41 Many people visited him there, and they were saying¦73246 that even though John had never done even one miracle, on the other¦73257 hand, everything that he had said about Jesus was true,
\v 42 and many people there¦73274 believed¦73270 that Jesus was from God.
\c 11
\s1 Jesus is aware of Lazarus' death from afar
\p
\v 1 \x + \xo 11:1: \xt Luk 10:38-39.\x*Now there was a man¦73277 called Lazarus¦73280 who lived in the village¦73285 of Bethany along with his¦73283 sisters¦73293 Martha¦73290 and¦73288 Maria¦73287.
\v 2 \x + \xo 11:2: \xt Jn 12:3.\x*(Maria¦73301 was the one who <a href="#C12V3">later</a> poured fragrant oil over Jesus and¦73307 wiped¦73308 his¦73311 feet¦73310 with her¦73314 hair.) But now their¦73314 brother¦73318 was seriously ill
\v 3 and so the two sisters¦73330 sent¦73324 a message to Jesus saying¦73337, “Master, this man that you¦73342 love is seriously ill.”
\p
\v 4 However, when Jesus got the message he said¦73348, “This sickness¦73351 won't end in death¦73356 but in honour for God, so that his¦73370 son will also be honoured because of it.”
\p
\v 5 Now it was true that Jesus¦73377 loved the three of them.
\v 6 Yet when he heard¦73393 that Lazarus was sick, he stayed in the place¦73406 where he was for two¦73407 more days¦73408
\v 7 before he said to his followers¦73416, “It's time to head down to Judea again¦73423.”
\p
\v 8 But they double-checked, “Honoured teacher, the Judeans wanted to execute you, so do you really want to go back there¦73439 again¦73437?”
\p
\v 9 And Jesus¦73442 answered¦73440, “There are twelve hours¦73446 of light in the day. Anyone who walks during the daytime doesn't stumble¦73462 because¦73463 he is seeing¦73470 the light of this world¦73467.
\v 10 But anyone¦73473 who walks at night¦73477 will stumble¦73478, because¦73479 the light¦73481 is not in them.”
\v 11 And he continued, “Our¦73498 friend¦73497 Lazarus¦73494 has fallen¦73499 asleep¦73499, but I'm going¦73502 so that I can wake him up.”
\p
\v 12 But his followers¦73513 objected, “Master, \add it's good\add* if he's sleeping because it helps with healing.”
\p
\v 13 But Jesus had spoken¦73522 about Lazarus' death¦73529—not just normal sleep as they had thought.
\v 14 So Jesus¦73548 told them plainly¦73549, “Lazarus¦73550 is dead
\v 15 and I'm glad that I wasn't there¦73564, because¦73557 you all will benefit as your¦73557 faith grows. Anyway, let's get moving.”
\p
\v 16 Thomas (nicknamed ‘Twin’) grumbled to the others, “Yeah, we might as well go so that we can get killed as well.”
\s1 Jesus is the resurrection and the life
\p
\v 17 So when they eventually arrived, Lazarus¦73589 body had already¦73598 been in the burial chamber for four¦73597 days¦73599.
\v 18 The village of Bethany was less than three kilometres from Jerusalem,
\v 19 so many of the Judeans there had come¦73625 out to console¦73635 Martha¦73630 and¦73631 Maria¦73633 after the death of their¦73638 brother¦73639.
\p
\v 20 As soon as Martha¦73643 heard¦73645 that Jesus¦73648 had arrived, she went out to meet him, but Maria¦73652 stayed behind where she was sitting¦73660 in the house¦73657.
\v 21 Martha¦73665 cried, “Jesus¦73668, master¦73670. If you'd been here, my¦73680 brother¦73679 wouldn't¦73676 have died¦73677,
\v 22 because I already know that anything that you ask from God, he will give it to you.”
\p
\v 23 Jesus¦73705 responded, “Your¦73710 brother¦73709 will come back to life.”
\p
\v 24 “Yes, I know that he'll come back to life at the resurrection¦73721 on the last day¦73725,” said Martha¦73714.
\p
\v 25 But Jesus continued, “\em I am\em* the resurrection¦73735 and¦73736 the life¦73738. Anyone who believes¦73740 that I'm from God, even if they die¦73744 they'll still be living¦73745,
\v 26 and everyone¦73748 who's alive and believes that I was sent from God, will not die¦73757 in the next age.
\p
\v 27 Martha replied, “Yes, master¦73768, I do believe¦73771 that you¦73774 are the messiah¦73777, God's son, the one sent into this world¦73785.”
\s1 Jesus weeps with his close friends
\p
\v 28 After saying this, Martha went¦73792 and quietly called¦73794 her¦73798 sister¦73797 Maria¦73795, “The teacher¦73806 is on his way¦73792 and he wants to see you.”
\v 29 So Maria quickly¦73818 stood up and¦73819 went to find him¦73823.
\v 30 At that stage, Jesus¦73830 hadn't yet come¦73828 into the village¦73834 proper, but¦73835 was still¦73837 at the edge where¦73842 Martha¦73846 had met him¦73844.
\v 31 The Judean people who'd been sitting with Maria¦73862 in sympathy there in the house¦73856, when they saw her get up quickly¦73865 and go out, they assumed that she was going¦73878 to the cemetary to weep there.
\p
\v 32 But when Maria¦73889 found Jesus¦73895, she¦73891 knelt at his¦73902 feet¦73906 and said, “Master, if you'd been here my¦73918 brother¦73921 wouldn't have died¦73919.”
\p
\v 33 Now when Jesus saw¦73926 her weeping there, along with the others that had followed also weeping, he himself¦73952 was quite affected and groaned¦73944 inside,
\v 34 but he just asked, “Where¦73955 has he been laid?”
\p “Master, come and see¦73964,” they replied.
\p
\v 35 Then Jesus¦73968 \add broke down and\add* wept,
\v 36 which made the others comment, “See how much he cared about him.”
\p
\v 37 But some of them mocked, “This is the man who could make a blind¦73996 man see again. How come he wasn't able to stop this man from dying!”
\s1 Jesus calls Lazarus back to life
\p
\v 38 So Jesus¦74003 who was still holding back sobs, went to the cemetary. Lazarus' body had been placed in a cave with a stone¦74021 blocking it,
\v 39 and Jesus¦74027 instructed them to take away the stone¦74030.
\p Martha¦74040 (the sister¦74036 of the dead man) spoke up, “Master, the stink¦74043 will be bad because it's already¦74042 been four days.”
\p
\v 40 But Jesus¦74050 responded, “Didn't I tell you that if you would believe¦74056, then you would see God's power?”
\v 41 So they took¦74064 the stone¦74068 away and Jesus¦74077 looked upwards¦74082 and said¦74084, “father¦74085, I thank¦74086 you that you listen to me.
\v 42 Actually I know that you always¦74095 hear me, but I said¦74104 that for the sake of these people so that they will believe¦74106 that it¦74104 was you who sent¦74110 me here.”
\v 43 After saying that, he¦74116 shouted, “Lazarus¦74119, come¦74121 out!”
\v 44 Then the man who had died¦74127 \add slowly\add* shuffled out—still with linen¦74138 strips¦74138 wrapped around his hands¦74136 and his feet¦74131, and a cloth wrapped around his face¦74141.
\s1 The leaders create a plan to execute Jesus
\r (Mat. 26:1-5; Mrk. 14:1-2; Luk. 22:1-2)
\p
\v 45 Because of that, many of the Judeans believed¦74180 that Jesus was from God after having followed Maria¦74170 and¦74171 seeing what Jesus did.
\v 46 But others went¦74187 and¦74192 told the Pharisee party¦74191 what Jesus¦74202 had done.
\v 47 So the chief¦74206 priests¦74206 and the Pharisee party¦74209 called a formal meeting and asked, “What should we¦74215 do because¦74217 this man¦74220 is doing many miracles.
\v 48 If we allow¦74228 him to continue like this, all the crowds will be believing¦74232 he's the messiah, and then the Romans will come and destroy both our temple and our governance.”
\p
\v 49 But one of them, Caiaphas who was chief¦74261 priest¦74261 that year¦74264, spoke up, “You don't know anything.
\v 50 Don't you all realise that its better for all of us if one man¦74281 dies so that the people¦74285 and the nation¦74290 won't be destroyed?”
\v 51 He didn't say this from his own thinking, but being¦74301 chief¦74300 priest¦74300 that year¦74303, he was announcing God's message that Jesus¦74312 was going¦74310 to die for the nation¦74317,
\v 52 and¦74318 not only for this nation¦74322, but¦74324 for all of God's children¦74328 scattered¦74333 around the world to become united.
\p
\v 53 As a result, from that day¦74343 on they decided that Jesus needed to be executed.
\v 54 Because of that, Jesus no longer¦74354 walked around Judea in public¦74355, but¦74360 went¦74361 out to the town of Ephraim¦74371 out in the wilderness¦74369 and¦74374 stayed there¦74351 with his followers¦74381.
\p
\v 55 At that time, the Jewish Passover celebrations were approaching, and¦74392 many people from the regions¦74401 went¦74393 to Jerusalem ahead of the celebrations to purify¦74409 themselves¦74410.
\v 56 They were looking out for Jesus¦74415 and as they stood¦74424 around in the temple¦74423, asked each other, “What do you think? Surely he won't come¦74433 to the celebrations.”
\v 57 The chief¦74442 priests¦74442 and the Pharisee party¦74445 had already announced that if anyone¦74452 knew where¦74455 Jesus was, they must inform them so that they could arrest¦74460 him¦74461.
\c 12
\s1 Maria sacrifices expensive fragrant oil
\r (Mat. 26:6-13; Mrk. 14:3-9)
\p
\v 1 Because of this, Jesus went to Bethany six days¦74468 before¦74465 the Passover. This was where¦74474 Lazarus¦74476 lived, the one Jesus had brought back to life.
\v 2 So they prepared dinner for him there¦74492 and Martha¦74495 was serving¦74496 and Lazarus¦74501 was among those sitting with Jesus.
\v 3 \x + \xo 12:3: \xt Luk 7:37-38.\x*Then Maria¦74512 took about 300g of very expensive nard oil and smeared it on Jesus' feet, and then wiped¦74529 off his¦74518 feet with her¦74518 own hair, and the house¦74539 was filled¦74540 with the fragrance of the oil.
\v 4 But Judas, one of Jesus' apprentices¦74557 (the one who would eventually turn him in) complained,
\v 5 “How come this lotion wasn't sold for almost a year's wages and¦74581 then the money given¦74582 to the poor?”
\v 6 But he said¦74585 this not because he cared for poor people, but because he carried their purse and used to steal from it.
\p
\v 7 But Jesus responded, “Let her¦74617 continue. She has kept this for the time of my¦74624 burial¦74623.
\v 8 \x + \xo 12:8: \xt Deu 15:11.\x*You'll always have poor people with you, but you won't always have me here.”
\s1 The leaders also plan to kill Lazarus
\p
\v 9 When it was discovered that Jesus was there¦74652, many Judeans started arriving, not only because¦74658 of Jesus, but¦74662 also to see¦74668 Lazarus¦74666 who'd been dead¦74674 and¦74654 Jesus had brought him back to life.
\v 10 But the chief¦74681 priests¦74681 decided in a meeting that they¦74686 should also have Lazarus¦74685 killed,
\v 11 because many people were ignoring them and¦74696 instead were believing¦74697 that Jesus¦74701 came from God.
\s1 Jesus rides into Jerusalem with many cheers
\r (Mat. 21:1-11; Mrk. 11:1-11; Luk. 19:28-40)
\p
\v 12 The next day¦74702 a large crowd¦74705 of people who had come¦74709 for the celebrations and had heard¦74713 that Jesus¦74717 was there in Jerusalem
\v 13 \x + \xo 12:13: \xt Psa 118:25-26.\x*took¦74722 \add long\add* branches¦74725 from palm trees¦74727 and brought them out as they went to meet him¦74734. They called out, “Honoured¦74741 saviour¦74741! The one coming¦74745 in the authority of the master¦74748 has been blessed¦74743 \add by God\add*. He's the king¦74751 of Israel.”
\p
\v 14 Now Jesus¦74758 had found¦74755 a young donkey¦74759 and rode it just like it was written¦74765 in the scriptures,
\q1
\v 15 \x + \xo 12:15: \xt Zech 9:9.\x*“Don't be worried you¦74775 children of Zion. Your¦74775 king¦74774 is coming¦74776 mounted on a donkey's¦74781 foal.”
\p
\v 16 (Jesus' apprentices didn't realise all these things at the time, but it was later after Jesus was lifted up to heaven that they were reminded¦74799 that these things had been written¦74810 about him, and that they had happened to him.)
\p
\v 17 People in the crowd¦74818 were telling each other about how they'd been with Jesus when he'd called¦74827 Lazarus¦74826 out from the burial chamber and brought him back to life,
\v 18 So because¦74847 of this, others also wanted to met Jesus when they¦74848 heard¦74848 that he'd done that miracle.
\v 19 So the Pharisees discussed this together, “We're getting nowhere with this. Look, it seems like the whole world¦74872 wants to follow him¦74875.”
\s1 Some Greeks want to meet Jesus
\p
\v 20 And some Greek people were also going¦74885 to Jerusalem to worship God at the celebrations
\v 21 and they¦74905 approached¦74895 Philip from Bethsaida up in Galilee¦74903 and asked him¦74906, “Mister, we'd like to meet this Jesus¦74911.”
\v 22 So Philip went and told Andrew, and the two of them went and told Jesus¦74932.
\s1 Jesus predicts his death again
\p
\v 23 Now Jesus¦74935 told them, “The time has come¦74940 for mankind's child to be honoured.
\v 24 I can assure you that unless a wheat¦74958 seed drops into the ground¦74962 and dies, it will stay just as it is, but if it dies, it's able to produce a harvest.
\v 25 \x + \xo 12:25: \xt Mat 10:39; 16:25; Mrk 8:35; Luk 9:24; 17:33.\x*Whoever loves their life will lose it, but the one hating¦74984 their life in this world¦74990 will stay alive forever.
\v 26 Anyone who wants to serve me needs to follow¦75006 after¦75005 me, so that wherever¦75008 I am, my servant¦75016 will be there¦75013 also. Anyone who serves me will be honoured¦75027 by the father¦75030.
\p
\v 27 Now, I'm very troubled. What else could I say¦75039 other than, ‘father, let me avoid what's coming.’ But it was exactly this that I came¦75050 for.
\v 28 father¦75055, may your¦75059 name¦75061 and authority be honoured.”
\p And a voice¦75078 from the sky answered, “I've already brought honour to it and will do so again¦75086.”
\p
\v 29 This caused some in the crowd¦75091 standing there to say that they'd heard¦75096 thunder¦75100 while others said that an angel¦75108 must have spoken¦75110 to Jesus.
\p
\v 30 Jesus responded, “That voice¦75123 wasn't for my¦75119 sake, but¦75127 for all of you¦75129.
\v 31 This world is about to be judged and its ruler¦75138 will be thrown¦75143 out,
\v 32 and when I'm lifted up\f + \fr 12:32 \ft lifted up / exalted: See https://bibleDifferences.net/2019/04/25/156-exulted\f* from the earth¦75155, I will attract everyone towards me.”
\v 33 By saying¦75165 this, he was indicating how he was going¦75169 to die.
\p
\v 34 \x + \xo 12:34: \xt Psa 110:4; Isa 9:7; Eze 37:25; Dan 7:14.\x*So the crowd¦75176 queried him¦75174, “We heard¦75178 from the scriptures that the messiah¦75184 will stay until the end of the age so why do you¦75193 say that mankind's child will be lifted up. And who is this ‘mankind's child’?”
\p
\v 35 Jesus¦75213 answered them, “The light will be among you all for just a little¦75215 bit longer, so get walking while¦75226 you have the light so that you won't have to deal with darkness. Anyone walking in the dark doesn't know where¦75247 they're going¦75248.
\v 36 While¦75249 you still have the light, believe¦75254 in the light so that you will become¦75262 children of light.”
\p Jesus¦75266 said these¦75263 things¦75263 and then after leaving them, he was hidden¦75271 from them.
\s1 Many people refuse to stand for Jesus
\p
\v 37 Even though Jesus had done so many miracles in front of the people, they¦75283 didn't believe¦75283 that he was the messiah.
\v 38 \x + \xo 12:38: \xt Isa 53:1 (LXX).\x*This fulfilled¦75293 what the prophet¦75292 Isaiah wrote,
\q1 “Master, who believed¦75298 our¦75301 report¦75300?
\q1 And who was the master's power revealed¦75307 to?”
\p
\v 39 Because¦75308 of this, they¦75311 weren't able to believe¦75313, and again¦75317 as Isaiah¦75319 wrote,
\q1
\v 40 \x + \xo 12:40: \xt Isa 6:10 (LXX).\x*“He has blinded¦75320 their eyes and maimed¦75326 their emotions,
\q1 so that they can't see with their eyes and understand¦75338 with their minds,
\q2 or they might be turned¦75344 and then I would heal them.”
\p
\v 41 Isaiah wrote this because¦75355 he saw¦75358 his¦75363 greatness and spoke¦75365 concerning¦75366 him.
\v 42 Likewise¦75368, many of the Jewish leaders believed¦75376 that Jesus was the messiah, but they didn't tell others because¦75380 they didn't want the Pharisee party¦75382 to banish them from the services
\v 43 as they¦75390 valued the praise of people more than praise from God.
\s1 It's Jesus' teachings that will judge the hearers
\p
\v 44 Then Jesus called out, “Anyone who believes that I came from God is not \add just\add* believing in me, but¦75422 \add also\add* believing in the one who sent¦75425 me,
\v 45 and¦75427 anyone who watches me \add working\add*, is watching the one who sent¦75434 me.
\v 46 I came into this world¦75440 as light¦75437 so that anyone who believes¦75445 in me won't have the darkess residing in them.
\v 47 I won't be judging¦75470 anyone¦75456 who hears my¦75457 teaching and¦75462 doesn't obey it, because I didn't come to judge¦75476 the world but¦75479 rather to save¦75481 it.
\v 48 Whoever rejects¦75485 me and¦75487 doesn't accept my¦75492 teaching does have a judge though—it's the message¦75498 that I spoke¦75500 that will judge them at the end of time
\v 49 because I wasn't speaking¦75531 from my own thoughts, but¦75516 it was the father¦75520 himself¦75521 who sent¦75518 me that told me what to say¦75528 and¦75529 what to teach.
\v 50 And I'm fully aware that \add obeying\add* his¦75537 commands¦75536 leads to living forever. Therefore¦75544 whenever I speak, I just say whatever the father¦75552 said¦75549 to me.”
\c 13
\s1 Jesus washes the feet of his apprentices
\p
\v 1 Even before¦75555 the actual feast part of the Passover celebrations, Jesus¦75563 knew that his time had come, when he would leave this world and \add return\add* to the father¦75581. He loved his followers who were in the world right through to the end¦75591.
\p
\v 2 And now it was getting near time for the dinner and the devil¦75600 had already¦75601 put the idea into Judas Iscariot's mind to hand Jesus over \add to the authories\add*.
\v 3 Jesus knew that the father¦75632 had given¦75628 everything to him, putting it under his control, and he knew that he had come from God and would return to God.
\v 4 So he got up from the dinner \add table\add*, changed out of his clothes¦75656, and wrapped a linen¦75660 towel¦75660 around himself¦75663.
\v 5 Then he put water¦75667 into the wash bowl and started washing¦75676 the feet¦75678 of his apprentices¦75680, wiping¦75683 them dry with the linen¦75685 towel¦75685 that was he was wearing wrapped around him.
\v 6 After he'd washed a few, he got to Simon Peter who asked him, “Master, are you going to wash my¦75702 feet¦75705?”
\p
\v 7 And Jesus answered¦75706, “What I'm doing¦75714 now you won't really understand, but in the future you will.”
\p
\v 8 Peter responded, “Well I'm never ever going to let you wash \em my\em* feet¦75739!”
\p “If I don't wash them,” Jesus¦75747 answered¦75744, “then you won't be included in my \add group\add*.”
\p
\v 9 “Well, if that's so,” Peter said, “don't just wash my feet¦75767 but¦75770 my hands¦75773 and¦75774 my head as well.”
\p
\v 10 Jesus¦75780 responded, “Any person who's already washed¦75782 \add themselves\add* only needs to wash their feet¦75794 now to be clean. And so you're clean, but not every one of you.”
\v 11 He said¦75818 this last bit because¦75816 he already knew who was going to hand him over.
\p
\v 12 \x + \xo 13:12-15: \xt Luk 22:27.\x*So when he'd finished washing their¦75829 feet¦75828, he got dressed again¦75840 and sat¦75839 down and asked, “Do you know what I just did to you all?
\v 13 You call me teacher and master¦75854, and so you¦75857 should, because I am.
\v 14 So if the master¦75870 and teacher of you all washed¦75864 your¦75865 feet, then you also ought¦75879 to wash each other's feet.
\v 15 I have given¦75888 this to you all as an example¦75885 that you can also do to others.
\v 16 \x + \xo 13:16: \xt Mat 10:24; Luk 6:40; Jn 15:20.\x*I can assure you that a slave¦75904 isn't greater than his¦75908 master¦75907, and an ambassador¦75911 isn't greater than the \add king\add* who sends him.
\v 17 If you can figure all this out and then do it, you will be blessed¦75920 \add by God\add*.
\p
\v 18 \x + \xo 13:18: \xt Psa 41:9.\x*“But I'm not talking about¦75926 all of you¦75928. I know each one that I chose¦75935, but¦75936 this \add that was written\add* in the scriptures¦75940 must be fulfilled¦75941,
\q1 ‘The one sharing food with me, lifted¦75949 up his¦75955 boot against¦75951 me.’
\v 19 So I'm telling¦75958 you now before¦75960 it happens so that when it does happen, then you'll all believe¦75964 that I am \add the messiah\add*.
\v 20 \x + \xo 13:20: \xt Mat 10:40; Mrk 9:37; Luk 9:48; 10:16.\x*I can assure you¦75976 all that anyone¦75982 who accepts any person that I might send¦75983, they're accepting me, and¦75988 whoever accepts me, is accepting the one who sent¦75995 me.”
\s1 Jesus indicates who will hand him over
\r (Mat. 26:20-25; Mrk. 14:17-21; Luk. 22:21-23)
\p
\v 21 After saying¦76011 these¦75997 things¦75997, Jesus was troubled in himself and said, “I can assure you that one of you will be handing me over.”
\p
\v 22 This made his apprentices¦76028 glance around at each other, puzzled about which one he was talking about.
\v 23 One of them that Jesus¦76053 especially liked,\f + \fr 13:23 \ft This apprentice, unnamed here, is assumed to be the author of this account (being shy or modest).\f* was leaning against him¦76042 \add at the table\add*.
\v 24 So Simon Peter nodded to him to find out who Jesus had been talking about¦76074,
\v 25 and he¦76085 leaned¦76079 back on Jesus¦76088 and asked \add quietly\add*, “Master, who is it¦76093?”
\p
\v 26 Jesus¦76098 answered¦76094, “It's the one I hand this piece of bread to after I've dipped it \add in the sauce\add*.” Then after dipping his¦76120 piece of bread, he gave it to Judas Iscariot.
\v 27 After accepting the piece¦76133 of bread¦76133, Satan¦76139 entered into him, and then Jesus¦76145 told him, “What you're about to do, do it soon.”
\v 28 But none of the others sitting around the table knew¦76154 what Jesus meant.
\v 29 Some of them thought that since Judas held their purse, perhaps Jesus¦76179 was getting him¦76177 to buy something they needed for the feast¦76188, or to give¦76194 something to the poor.
\p
\v 30 Anyway, having¦76196 eaten the piece¦76199 of bread¦76199, Judas went straight outside where it¦76204 was already dark.
\s1 The new command to love each other
\p
\v 31 After he had gone, Jesus told the others, “Now mankind's child will be honoured and God will be honoured through him.
\v 32 Also God himself¦76238 will be honouring him and will do that immediately¦76241.
\v 33 My friends, I'll be with you only a little¦76248 bit longer. You'll all look for me and as I told\x + \xo 13:33: \xt Jn 7:34.\x* the religious leaders, you won't be able to come¦76269 where I'm going¦76264. So now I'm also telling all of you.
\v 34 \x + \xo 13:34: \xt Jn 15:12,17; 1Jn 3:23; 2Jn 5.\x*I'm giving¦76277 you a new commandment¦76275—you need to love each other. The way that I loved¦76285 all of you is how you should love each other.
\v 35 This is actually how you'll know if you are my followers¦76302: if you are loving each other.
\s1 Jesus predicts that Peter will disown him
\r (Mat. 26:31-35; Mrk. 14:27-31; Luk. 22:31-34)
\p
\v 36 Now Peter followed-up, “Master, where¦76318 are you going?”
\p “Where¦76325 I'm going,” Jesus¦76324 answered¦76320, “you won't be able to follow me at this stage, but you will follow me eventually.”
\p
\v 37 Peter asked again, “Why can't I follow¦76356 after¦76353 you now? I'm prepared to give my¦76363 life¦76362 for you.”
\p
\v 38 But Jesus¦76371 responded, “You think you'll be giving your¦76377 life¦76376 for me? I can assure you that the rooster¦76389 won't crow until¦76392 you've already disowned¦76395 me three¦76399 times¦76399.”
\c 14
\s1 Jesus is the road to the father but will be leaving
\p
\v 1 \add Jesus continued telling them,\add* “Don't be living in fear. You believe that God is real, and you also believe that I was sent by him.
\v 2 There are many places¦76437 to live in my¦76423 father's¦76422 residence—I would¦76432 have told you if there wasn't because¦76434 I'm going¦76435 there to prepare¦76436 a place¦76437 for all of you.
\v 3 And after I've gone to prepare¦76445 that place¦76448, then I'll be coming¦76451 back again¦76450 and will bring you to myself¦76457, so that where¦76459 I am, you all can be there also.
\v 4 You know how to get where¦76468 I'm going¦76470.”
\p
\v 5 But Thomas asked, “Master, we don't \add even\add* know where¦76485 you're going¦76486, let alone how to get there.”
\p
\v 6 And Jesus answered, “\em I am\em* the road and the truth¦76506 and the life¦76509. No one can get to the father¦76514 except¦76515 via me.
\v 7 If you had all known¦76521 me, you would also know my¦76527 father¦76526 and from now on you do know him and have seen¦76540 him.”
\p
\v 8 So Philip said, “Master, show us the father¦76550 and¦76551 that'll be enough for us.”
\p
\v 9 But Jesus¦76557 replied, “I've been with you all for quite some time¦76560, and yet you still don't \add even\add* know me, Philip.
\v 10 You don't believe¦76587 that I am in the father and the father is in me. These things that I've been telling you all, I don't make them up myself¦76609, but the father who lives in me is doing¦76620 what he wants.
\v 11 You all need to believe that I am in the father and the father is in me. If that's hard, at least believe it because¦76645 of what he's doing.
\v 12 I can assure you¦76656 all that whoever believes¦76658 \add that God sent\add* me and is the source of the miracles that I do, that person will be able to do the same and even greater¦76670 miracles because¦76673 I am going¦76679 to the father¦76677.
\v 13 Whatever you request¦76687 from me with my¦76693 name¦76692 and authority, I will do it so that the father¦76699 might be honoured because of the son.
\v 14 Anything that you¦76706 all request¦76706 using my¦76711 name¦76710 and authority, it¦76714 will be done.
\s1 The father will be sending a different advocate
\p
\v 15 “If you all love me, you will obey my commands¦76720.
\v 16 And I will ask the father¦76732 and he will give another¦76735 assistant to you to be with you for this age—
\v 17 the spirit¦76753 of truth¦76755. The world¦76758 cannot accept him, because it doesn't see or know him.
\p
\v 18 “And I won't leave you all here as orphans¦76789, but I will come back to you.
\v 19 It won't be long now and the world¦76797 won't see me any more, but you will see me because¦76805 I'll be alive and you all will be alive also.
\v 20 At that time you will know that I am in my¦76825 father¦76824, and you all are in me, and I am in you all.
\p
\v 21 “Whoever takes my commands¦76838 and obeys them, that's the person who loves me, and whoever loves me will be loved¦76852 by my father¦76856, and I will be loving them and will be revealing myself¦76867 to them.”
\p
\v 22 Judas (not Judas Iscariot) asked, “Master, what's going¦76886 on? Why would you¦76886 reveal yourself¦76891 to us and¦76892 not to the \add whole\add* world¦76895?”
\p
\v 23 Jesus answered¦76896, “If anyone¦76903 loves me, they'll obey my teaching, and my father¦76913 will love them and we will go to that person and live with them.
\v 24 But whoever doesn't love me, won't obey my teaching. The words that you¦76951 hear from me are not my own, but¦76955 come from the father¦76959 who sent¦76957 me.
\p
\v 25 “I told you all this while I have been here with you all.
\v 26 But the pure spirit¦76971, the assistant who the father¦76978 will be sending¦76975 with my¦76983 authority, he will be teaching¦76986 you everything, and will be reminding¦76989 you of everything that I told you all.
\p
\v 27 I will leave peace with you all. I'm giving my peace to you all, but what I'm giving isn't like what the world¦77009 gives. Don't be upset or afraid.
\v 28 You all heard¦77022 me say that I'm going away and then will be coming¦77029 back. If you really loved me, you'd be very happy that I'm going to the father, because¦77045 the father is greater¦77049 than me.
\v 29 But I've told you now before¦77056 it happens, so that when it does come to pass, you'll be able to believe¦77061 \add that it was preplanned\add*.
\v 30 I won't have much more time to talk to you, because the ruler¦77074 of the world¦77072 is coming¦77068 and he has nothing¦77080 in common with me,
\v 31 but he's coming so that the world¦77086 can know that I love the father and whatever the father told me to do, I'm doing¦77100 it.

\s1 The branches must stay connected to the vine
\p
\v 1 “\em I am\em* the true vine¦77107 and¦77110 my¦77113 father¦77112 is the farmer¦77115.
\v 2 He takes away every¦77128 one of my branches that doesn't bear fruit, but those that do bear fruit, he prunes them so they'll produce even more.
\v 3 You all are already¦77144 clean¦77146 because¦77148 of the teaching that I've given you¦77154.
\v 4 Stay in me, and I will stay in you all, because just as a branch¦77163 can't bear fruit¦77166 in isolation when it's not connected to the vine¦77176, neither¦77178 can you if you don't stay in me.
\p
\v 5 “\em I am\em* the vine¦77193 and you all are the branches¦77196. Whoever stays in me will produce a lot of fruit¦77206—apart¦77209 from me you can't do anything.
\v 6 Anyone who doesn't stay in me will be thrown away like a branch¦77230, and will wither¦77232 and be gathered¦77234 together¦77234 with others, and thrown into the fire¦77240 to be burnt.
\v 7 If you stay in me and my¦77254 teaching stays in you, then you can request¦77265 whatever¦77259 you all want and it¦77268 will be done for you.
\v 8 My¦77275 father¦77274 will be honoured and praised when you produce a lot of fruit¦77277, and you all become¦77283 my¦77275 followers¦77288.
\v 9 I loved you¦77296 all just as the father¦77293 loved me, so stay in my love¦77301.
\v 10 If you obey my commands, you all will be staying in my love, just like I've obeyed my father's¦77323 commands and I am staying in his¦77316 love.
\p
\v 11 “I've told you these¦77336 things¦77336 so that I'll be happy with you all, and so that your¦77352 happiness will be genuine and long-lasting.
\v 12 \x + \xo 15:12: \xt Jn 13:34; 15:17; 1Jn 3:23; 2Jn 5.\x*So here's my request: Keep loving¦77361 each other just like I loved¦77365 you¦77366 all.
\v 13 No one has greater¦77367 love¦77369 than the one who gives up their own life¦77377 for their friends¦77384.
\v 14 You are my¦77390 friends¦77389 if you do what I am telling you.
\v 15 I'm not calling you slaves¦77405, because a slave¦77408 doesn't know his¦77413 master's¦77415 plans, but I'm calling you friends¦77420 because I've told you everything that I heard¦77425 from my¦77430 father¦77429.
\v 16 You didn't choose me, but I chose you all, and I assigned you to be going¦77447 and producing fruit and for your¦77456 fruit to be permanent so that whatever¦77460 you request¦77464 from the father¦77467 in my¦77471 name and authority, he will give it to you.
\v 17 I am telling you all this so that you all can love each other.
\s1 People will hate Jesus-followers
\p
\v 18 If the world¦77483 hates you, you all know that it hated me before¦77491 it hated you.
\v 19 If you belong to this world then the world would¦77501 love you as its¦77502 own people, but you don't belong to this world because I chose¦77519 you out of it. That's why they hate you all.
\v 20 \x + \xo 15:20: \xt Mat 10:24; Luk 6:40; Jn 13:16.\x*Remember that I told you that slaves¦77550 are not greater¦77551 than their¦77564 master¦77553. So if they persecuted me, they'll also be persecuting you all. (If they'd obeyed my¦77564 teaching, they would also obey your¦77564 teaching.)
\v 21 But they will do all these¦77572 things¦77572 against¦77576 you¦77578 because of my¦77582 name¦77581 because they don't know the father who sent¦77587 me.
\v 22 They wouldn't be considered sinners except¦77589 that I came and spoke¦77593 to them, so now they don't have any excuse¦77602 for their¦77608 sin.
\v 23 Anyone who hates me is also hating my¦77615 father¦77614.
\v 24 If I hadn't done miracles among¦77622 them of the sort that no one else has done, they wouldn't be considered to be sinners, but now they've observed me and hated¦77640 both me and my¦77647 father¦77646.
\v 25 \x + \xo 15:25: \xt Psa 35:19; 69:4.\x*The writings of the prophets will certainly come to pass, that ‘they hated¦77662 me undeservedly¦77664’.
\p
\v 26 “When the assistant comes that I will send to you all from the father, the spirit¦77681 of truth coming from the father, he will tell the truth about me.
\v 27 You also will be able to tell the truth about me because¦77698 you all were with me from the beginning¦77700.
\c 16
\p
\v 1 “I've told you this so that you won't stumble¦77709.
\v 2 First they will ban you all from their religious services¦77724, but there's a time coming¦77716 when people will kill you thinking they're actually doing a sacred¦77724 service¦77724 to God,
\v 3 but they'll be doing¦77731 these¦77730 things¦77730 because¦77734 they don't know either the father¦77738 or me.
\v 4 I've told these things to you all so that when they happen in the future, you'll remember¦77752 that I had already told you about¦77754 them.
\s1 The work of Spirit of God
\p “I didn't tell you all of this right at the beginning¦77763 because¦77767 I was with you all,
\v 5 but soon I'll be returning to the one who sent me. Yet none of you are asking¦77783 me where I'll be going,
\v 6 rather you are all just weighed down because¦77789 I've told you these¦77790 things¦77790.
\v 7 But honestly it's for your benefit¦77805 that I will leave here, because if I don't, then the assistant won't be coming¦77819 to you. But after I've gone, I'll send him¦77830 to you all.
\v 8 And when he comes, he'll scold the world¦77838 about sin¦77840 and teach them about righteousness¦77843 and judgement—
\v 9 about sin¦77848 because¦77850 they¦77852 don't believe¦77852 that I was sent by God,
\v 10 about righteousness¦77856 because¦77858 I am going¦77863 to the father¦77861 and you¦77866 won't be able to see me any longer¦77865,
\v 11 and¦77869 about judgement¦77877, because¦77871 the ruler¦77873 of this world¦77875 has been judged¦77877.
\p
\v 12 “I still¦77878 have a lot to tell you all, but you're not able to handle it all right now.
\v 13 But when the assistant comes, the spirit¦77895 of truth, he will guide you in all truth because he won't be speaking from his own thoughts, but will tell you what he's been told, and he will explain to you what's still going to happen.
\v 14 He'll be honouring me because¦77934 he'll take what is mine and¦77939 will explain it to you¦77942 all.
\v 15 Everthing that the father¦77947 has is mine, that's why I said¦77952 he take what is mine and explain it to you.
\s1 A brief upset coming followed by happiness
\p
\v 16 “Not much longer¦77964 and you won't be able to see me any more, and then a little while after that, and you'll see me again¦77969.”
\p
\v 17 This got his¦77986 followers¦77985 asking each other, “What's all this about seeing him for not much longer, and then seeing him again¦78003 after a while? And why does he say he's going¦78012 to the father¦78015?”
\v 18 So they¦78016 were saying¦78016, “What's this about ‘not much longer’? We don't know what he¦78031 means.”
\p
\v 19 However Jesus knew¦78033 what they wanted to ask him, and so he said to them, “You are trying to find out from each other what I meant when I said that you won't be able to see me after a little while, and then a little while after that you'll see me again¦78065.
\v 20 I can assure you that you'll be weeping¦78075 and mourning but the world¦78081 will be elated¦78082. You'll be upset but then your¦78089 upset will turn into happiness.
\v 21 A woman¦78094 giving birth has a pains when the delivery begins, but when she hears that the baby is born, she doesn't remember¦78112 those pains any more because she's so happy that her¦78105 child¦78110 was born.
\v 22 So too with all of you: you'll be upset for a while but then I'll be with you again¦78138 and you'll be so happy and no one will be able to take that happiness away from you.
\p
\v 23 “When that happens, you won't be asking¦78165 me for anything¦78176. I can assure you that whatever you request¦78177 from the father¦78179 in my name¦78184 and my authority will be given to you.
\v 24 Up until now you haven't asked \add him\add* for anything using my¦78197 authority, but then you'll be able to make requests¦78191 and they'll be answered so that your¦78206 happiness will be complete.
\s1 A new era is coming very soon
\p
\v 25 “So far I've told you these things in parables, however a time is coming¦78216 when I'll no longer¦78220 be speaking¦78223 in parables but will tell you things about the father¦78230 quite plainly¦78227.
\v 26 At that time you'll have my¦78245 authority to request¦78246 from the father¦78255. I'm not saying¦78249 that I'll be asking¦78253 him on your behalf,
\v 27 no, because he¦78261 himself¦78259 loves you all because you have loved¦78269 me and have believed¦78271 that I was sent by God.
\v 28 I was sent out by the father and I have come into the world, but I'll be leaving¦78291 the world again¦78290 and returning to the father.”
\p
\v 29 Jesus' followers responded, “Ah, now you're speaking plainly¦78309 and not using parables.
\v 30 Finally we realise that you know everything already and don't need to ask anyone¦78325 else, and so we now believe¦78330 that you came¦78335 from God.”
\p
\v 31 Jesus answered¦78336, “So you¦78341 all believe¦78341 now?
\v 32 The time is coming¦78345 and is here already when you all will be scattered¦78353 in various directions and will leave¦78363 me by myself, but I won't be alone¦78367 because¦78368 the father¦78370 is \add always\add* with me.
\v 33 I've told you these¦78374 things¦78374 so that you all can have peace¦78381 in me. You will have troubles in this world, but be courageous¦78390 because I have overcome¦78392 the world.”
\c 17
\s1 Jesus prays for his current and future followers
\p
\v 1 After Jesus¦78399 had finished speaking, he looked up to the sky¦78408 and said¦78410, “father¦78411, it's now the time for you to honour your¦78416 son so that the son can honour you.
\v 2 You already gave¦78427 me authority¦78429 over all people so that I could grant eternal¦78445 life¦78444 to everyone¦78433 that you've given¦78435 me.
\v 3 And eternal¦78450 life¦78451 means knowing you, the only true God, and knowing me—Jesus¦78465 the messiah¦78466 that you sent.
\v 4 I honoured you here on the earth¦78476 by completing¦78481 everything that you gave¦78484 me to do.
\v 5 So father¦78495, now you yourself¦78498 can honour me with the greatness that I had when I was together with you before¦78506 the creation of the world¦78510.
\p
\v 6 “I revealed¦78514 your power to the ones that you gave me from this world¦78528. They were yours and you gave them to me, and they have obeyed your teaching.
\v 7 Now they understand that everything that you gave¦78553 to me came from you,
\v 8 because¦78561 I passed on to them the messages¦78563 that you gave¦78567 to me, and they accepted them. Now they believe¦78585 that I came¦78583 from you and that it was you who sent¦78590 me here.
\p
\v 9 “I'm asking about them. It's not the people of this world¦78598 that I'm asking about, but about the ones that you gave¦78603 to me because¦78606 they belong to you.
\v 10 Everything that's mine is yours, and everything that's your is mine, and I have been honoured by their actions.
\v 11 I am about to leave this world and come to you, but they will stay here in it. Holy father¦78662, use your¦78670 power to keep¦78665 protect the ones that you gave¦78688 to me, so that they might united just like you and I are one.
\v 12 \x + \xo 17:12: \xt Psa 41:9; Jn 13:18.\x*When I was with them, I protected them with the authority that you gave¦78715, and I guarded¦78719 them so that not one of them perished¦78725, except¦78726 the one who chose destruction¦78731 so that it will indeed happen as the scriptures¦78734 foretold.
\v 13 But soon I'll be coming¦78740 to you¦78739, and I'm speaking¦78743 these¦78742 things¦78742 in the world¦78747 so that they¦78749 will have the same happiness as me and be fulfilled¦78754 in their lives.
\v 14 I've passed on your¦78768 teaching to them, and¦78771 the world hated¦78774 them because¦78777 they¦78779 don't belong to this world, just as I don't.
\v 15 I'm not asking¦78794 you to remove them out of this world¦78800, but rather to stop evil¦78807 from overcoming them.
\v 16 They don't belong to this world just as I don't.
\v 17 Purify them with the truth—your message¦78831 is that truth.
\v 18 In the same way that you sent me out into this world, so I also send them out into the world.
\v 19 I'm purifying myself¦78856 for their sakes so that they¦78860 also may be made pure by the truth¦78864.
\p
\v 20 “But it's not just on behalf of the ones right here that I'm asking¦78870, but¦78872 also for all the others who will believe¦78877 that I came from you when they hear the message¦78881 of these¦78867 ones
\v 21 so that they will all become united, just as you, father¦78891, are in me and I am in you. I ask that they will also be in us so that the world¦78907 will be able to believe¦78908 that it was you who sent¦78913 me here.
\v 22 And the honour that you've given me, I've passed on to them so that they¦78928 can be united just as we¦78932 are one—
\v 23 me in them and you in me so that they can be perfected¦78947 as one. Then the world¦78955 will know that you sent¦78959 me here and that you love them like you love me.
\p
\v 24 Father, I want those that you've given¦78974 me to be with me wherever¦78979 I am so that they'll be able to see my greatness—the greatness that you gave¦78998 me because¦79000 you loved¦79001 me even before¦79003 the creation of the world¦79005.
\v 25 Righteous father¦79006, this world¦79011 didn't know you, but I know you and these¦79023 ones know that you sent¦79028 me here.
\v 26 I revealed your¦79034 power and authority to them and will continue to do so, so that the love with which¦79040 you love me might be in them, and I too might be in them.”

\s1 Jesus is arrested
\r (Mat. 26:47-56; Mrk. 14:43-50; Luk. 22:47-53)
\p
\v 1 After he'd said¦79055 all this, Jesus and his followers went out of Jerusalem and over the Kidron stream¦79066 towards a garden¦79073 that he and his followers entered.
\v 2 And Judas (the one who would hand him over) also knew the place¦79092 because¦79093 Jesus¦79098 and his¦79103 followers¦79102 often¦79094 met there.
\v 3 Meanwhile Judas had met with the soldiers and servants of the chief¦79114 priests¦79114 and the Pharisee party¦79118, and they all started coming¦79120 into the garden with lanterns¦79123 and flaming torches¦79125 and weapons¦79127.
\v 4 Jesus¦79128 who already knew what was going to happen to him¦79137, came forward and¦79129 asked them, “Who are you¦79145 all looking for?”
\p
\v 5 And they answered¦79146, “Jesus—the one from Nazareth¦79151.”
\p Jesus responded, “\em I am\em* the one.”
\p Judas, the one handing him over, was standing there among them.
\v 6 But when Jesus had said¦79170, “I am the one,” they backed away and fell to the ground¦79183.\f + \fr 18:6 \ft TD: It's not clear from the original if they fell over backwards, or if they stepped back and then fell forward (either voluntarily or unvoluntarily) onto their knees.\f*
\v 7 So he asked¦79187 them again¦79184, “Who are you all looking for?”
\p And they answered, “Jesus¦79197—the one from Nazareth¦79199.”
\p
\v 8 Jesus¦79203 responded, “I already told you all that \em I am\em* the one. So if it's me that you're looking for, let these¦79214 others leave.”
\v 9 (In this way, the statement was fulfilled¦79217 that Jesus had said¦79221 previously: “I didn't lose any of the ones that you¦79224 gave¦79224 me.”)\f + \fr 18:9 \ft TD: It's not certain from the original whether v9 was part of Mark's commentary on the events or part of Jesus's response to the arresting party.\f*
\p
\v 10 Then Simon Peter drew the sword¦79239 that he was carrying and swiped at the servant of the high priest¦79247, cutting off his¦79251 right¦79257 ear¦79253. The servant's name¦79261 was Malchus.
\v 11 \x + \xo 18:11: \xt Mat 26:39; Mrk 14:36; Luk 22:42.\x*But Jesus said¦79268 to Peter, “Put your sword¦79276 back in its sheath¦79280. I need to proceed with the plan that the father¦79288 has prepared for me—I can't just avoid the suffering.”
\s1 Jesus is taken to Annas
\p
\v 12 So the soldiers and their commander¦79299, and the servants of the Jewish leaders arrested Jesus¦79307 and tied him¦79310 up.
\v 13 First they¦79312 took him¦79312 to Annas¦79316, the father-in-law¦79320 of Caiaphas who was the chief¦79326 priest¦79326 that year¦79328.
\v 14 \x + \xo 18:14: \xt Jn 11:49-50.\x*(Caiaphas was the one who had suggested that it¦79339 was better for the people¦79346 and the nation if one man¦79341 should die¦79342.)
\s1 Peter denies being a Jesus-follower
\r (Mat. 26:59-66; Mrk. 14:55-64; Luk. 22:66-71)
\p
\v 15 Now Simon Peter and another intern were following Jesus, and since that other¦79356 intern was known¦79364 to the chief priest, he was allowed to enter¦79369 following Jesus into the courtyard¦79374 of the chief priest
\v 16 while Peter waited outside¦79385 at the door. Then the other¦79391 intern who was known¦79395 to the chief¦79400 priest¦79400 went back and spoke¦79402 to the woman at the door and brought¦79408 Peter in too.
\v 17 But the servant¦79419 girl¦79419 who was watching the door challenged Peter, “Aren't you also one of the followers¦79430 of that man¦79433?”
\p “No, I'm not,” he responded.
\p
\v 18 Meanwhile the servants and attended¦79446 had made a fire¦79447 and were standing around it¦79451 warming themselves¦79453, and Peter¦79460 also went and stood there to warm himself¦79465.
\s1 Annas tries to interrogate Jesus
\r (Mat. 26:59-66; Mrk. 14:69-72; Luk. 22:58-62)
\p
\v 19 Now the chief¦79468 priest¦79468 interrogated Jesus¦79471 about his followers¦79474 and¦79476 about his teaching¦79479.
\v 20 Jesus¦79485 answered¦79482 him¦79483, “I've spoken¦79490 openly to the people. I always¦79494 taught¦79495 in the meeting halls and in the temple¦79502 where¦79503 Jewish people meet. I didn't speak in secret¦79511
\v 21 so why are you¦79516 asking¦79516 \em me\em*? Ask the people who heard¦79521 what I told them—they're the ones who know what I said¦79529.”
\p
\v 22 When he said that, one of the attendants¦79539 standing there slapped Jesus¦79544 \add on the face\add* and said, “You think you can answer¦79547 the chief¦79549 priest¦79549 like that?”
\p
\v 23 But Jesus¦79554 responded, “If I said anything wrong¦79558, tell me my error. But if it was true, why are you¦79570 hitting me?”
\p
\v 24 So Annas¦79576 sent¦79571 him¦79574 away, still tied up, to Caiaphas the chief¦79581 priest¦79581.
\s1 Peter again denies following Jesus
\r (Mat. 26:71-75; Mrk. 14:69-72; Luk. 22:58-62)
\p
\v 25 Simon Peter was still standing by the fire warming¦79588 himself¦79588 when he was asked, “Aren't you also one of his¦79599 followers¦79598?”
\p But he denied it, saying, “No, I'm not.”
\p
\v 26 One of the servants of the chief¦79616 priest¦79616 who was a relative¦79617 of the man whose ear¦79623 Peter had cut off said, “Didn't I see you¦79626 in the garden¦79630 with that Jesus?”
\p
\v 27 But Peter¦79637 again¦79633 denied it, and¦79638 just then a rooster¦79641 crowed¦79642.
\s1 Pilate interrogates Jesus
\r (Mat. 26:71-75; Mrk. 14:69-72; Luk. 22:58-62)
\p
\v 28 Then they led Jesus out from Caiaphas and towards the residence of the governor. It was now the early¦79656 hours of the morning and as Jews, they didn't enter the residence of the Roman governor so they wouldn't become defiled¦79666 and thus unable to eat¦79669 the Passover meal.
\v 29 So Governor Pilate¦79677 came¦79672 outside¦79678 to them and¦79682 asked, “What charge are you¦79687 all bringing¦79687 against¦79688 this man¦79690?”
\p
\v 30 They answered¦79692, “We wouldn't¦79707 have brought him to you if he¦79698 hadn't committed a serious crime.”
\p
\v 31 So Pilate¦79717 said, “You just take him and judge¦79727 him yourselves according¦79723 to your¦79726 own laws.”
\p But the Jewish leaders responded, “We don't have permission¦79737 to execute anyone.”
\v 32 (This happened to fulfil¦79746 what Jesus¦79745 had said\x + \xo 18:32: \xt Jn 3:14; 12:32.\x* about the way that he was going¦79754 to die.)
\p
\v 33 So Pilate¦79765 went back into his¦79778 governor's¦79762 residence¦79762 and called¦79767 for Jesus¦79769 and asked him¦79772, “So you're the king¦79777 of the Jews?”
\p
\v 34 “Are you saying¦79791 this yourself¦79787,” Jesus¦79785 asked, “or did others¦79794 say it¦79796 about me?”
\p
\v 35 Pilate¦79803 retorted, “Hoy! I'm not a Jew. It was your own people and the chief¦79817 priests¦79817 that handed you over to me. What have you done?”
\p
\v 36 “My¦79840 kingdom is not in this world,” Jesus answered¦79824, “because if it was, my supporters would have fought so that I wouldn't have been handed over to the Jewish leaders. But no, my kingdom isn't from here.”
\p
\v 37 And Pilate¦79878 responded, “So you are a king then?”
\p “You're saying¦79890 that I'm a king,” said Jesus¦79886, “and indeed I was born to be a king. I came into the world¦79907 so that I could testify¦79909 to the truth.”
\p
\v 38 “\add Yeah.\add* What is truth¦79934?” said Pilate.
\s1 Pilate gives permission to execute an innocent man
\r (Mat. 27:15-31; Mrk. 15:6-20; Luk. 23:13-25)
\p After he'd said this, Pilate went back outside to the Jews and told them, “I can't find anything that he's guilty of.
\v 39 But you have a custom¦79956 here that the governor can release one prisoner during the Passover. So would you like me to release the king¦79974 of the Jews?”
\p
\v 40 But they¦79977 all yelled back, “No, not this one. Release Barabbas.” (Barabbas was a robber¦79991.)
\c 19
\p
\v 1 So Pilate¦79997 took¦79994 Jesus¦80000 and¦80001 had him¦80002 flogged¦80002.
\v 2 Then the soldiers¦80005 twisted¦80006 some thorn¦80009 branches together¦80006 into a crown¦80007 and put it¦80011 on Jesus' head, and they dressed him in a \add royal\add* purple¦80021 robe¦80020.
\v 3 They came up to him and said, “Greetings¦80030, you king¦80032 of the Jews,” and then slapped him.
\p
\v 4 Then Pilate¦80047 went back outside¦80045 and said to the Jews, “Look here. I'm bringing¦80053 him out to you so that you all can know¦80058 that I didn't find him guilty¦80066 of anything.”
\v 5 So they led Jesus out wearing¦80079 the thorny¦80082 crown¦80083 and the kingly robe¦80087, and Pilate said, “Look. Here's the man¦80094.”
\p
\v 6 Now when the chief¦80100 priests¦80100 and their supporters saw¦80097 him, they yelled out, Execute him on a stake! Execute him on a stake!”
\p Pilate¦80115 answered, “Well you take him and execute¦80121 him on a stake, because I haven't found anything that he's guilty¦80129 of.”
\p
\v 7 The Jews responded, “We have a law and he should be executed according¦80138 to that law because¦80144 he said he was the son of God.”
\p
\v 8 Now when Pilate¦80156 heard¦80154 that, he¦80162 became more afraid¦80162.
\v 9 So he went back inside the residence¦80167 and asked Jesus, “Where do you come from?”
\p But Jesus didn't answer¦80180 him.
\v 10 So Pilate¦80188 said, “Why don't you answer me? Don't you realise that I have the authority to release you and I also have the authority to have you executed¦80203 on a stake¦80203?”
\p
\v 11 Now Jesus¦80210 answered¦80207, “You have no authority¦80214 over me, none at all, except¦80219 what has been granted to you from above¦80225. Because¦80226 of this, the sin¦80234 of the person who handed me over to you is greater¦80233.”
\p
\v 12 After hearing this, Pilate¦80240 wanted to release him. But the Jews yelled out, “If you release that man¦80255, you're no friend of Caesar. Everyone¦80262 who claims to be a king is no friend of Caesar's.”
\p
\v 13 So now Pilate, having¦80275 heard¦80275 all this, brought¦80282 Jesus outside¦80283 \add again\add*. Pilate sat¦80288 down on the judge's seat at a place¦80293 called The Stone¦80295 Pavement¦80295 (and¦80287 called Gabbatha¦80300 in Hebrew).
\v 14 It was now about¦80310 noon on the day¦80304 when the Passover meal is prepared¦80304, and Pilate said to the Jews, “Look. Here's your¦80322 king¦80321.”
\p
\v 15 They yelled back, “Take him away. Take him away. Execute¦80331 him on a stake.”
\p Pilate¦80336 asked them, “You want me to have your¦80339 king executed¦80340 on a stake?”
\p “We don't have any king other than Caesar,” the chief priests¦80343 answered¦80341.
\p
\v 16 So Pilate handed Jesus¦80366 over to them, and they took¦80360 him away to be executed¦80357 on a stake¦80357.
\s1 Jesus is hung on a stake
\r (Mat. 27:32-44; Mrk. 15:21-32; Luk. 23:26-43)
\p
\v 17 Carrying the pole\f + \fr 19:17 \ft TD: The Greek word used here is used in other places to mean a stake such as used to make a fence. It's uncertain whether or not it had a horizontal cross-piece, although the Romans did use a range of methods.\f* himself¦80375, Jesus arrived at the Place of the Skull (called Golgotha¦80391 in Hebrew) just out of the city
\v 18 where¦80392 they secured him to the stake along with two¦80399 others¦80398—one stake on each side and with Jesus¦80407 in the middle¦80404.
\v 19 Pilate¦80413 wrote¦80408 out a title¦80411 and¦80414 put it¦80420 on the stake¦80419: Jesus¦80423 from Nazareth¦80425, the king¦80427 of the Jews.
\v 20 Many Jews read this title¦80434 because¦80440 the place¦80444 where¦80449 Jesus was executed¦80450 was near the city¦80446, and it¦80454 had been written¦80455 in Hebrew, Latin¦80458, and Greek.
\v 21 But the chief¦80466 priests¦80466 of the Jews complained to Pilate¦80464, “Don't write ‘The king of the Jews’, but rather ‘The one who said he was king of the Jews’.”
\p
\v 22 However Pilate¦80486 answered¦80484, “What I've written, I've written.”
\p
\v 23 After the soldiers¦80492 had fastened Jesus¦80498 to the stake¦80495, they took¦80499 his clothes¦80501 and placed in four¦80505 piles, one for each of them. This left his robe, which had been woven¦80521 from top to bottom in one piece.
\v 24 So they said to each other, “Rather than tear this, let's throw a dice to see who will get it.” (This fulfilled¦80542 what was written in the scriptures¦80541\x + \xo 19:24: \xt Psa 22:18.\x* that said: they divided¦80545 my garments among themselves¦80550 and threw¦80556 a dice for my clothes¦80548.) So they went ahead and did that.
\p
\v 25 Meanwhile a group of women had stayed standing near Jesus¦80570 on the stake¦80568: his mother and his aunt, Maria the wife of Clopas¦80584, and Maria from Magdala¦80589.
\v 26 When Jesus¦80590 saw his mother and also the intern that he loved standing nearby, he said to her, “Look, he'll be your¦80612 son.”
\v 27 And to the intern he said, “Look, she'll be your¦80621 mother¦80620.” And that intern took¦80628 her into his own \add home\add* from that time.
\s1 Jesus gives up his life on the stake
\r (Mat. 27:45-56; Mrk. 15:33-41; Luk. 23:44-49)
\p
\v 28 Having done this, Jesus knew that everything had been accomplished¦80647, and (in order¦80648 for the scriptures¦80652\x + \xo 19:28: \xt Psa 69:21; 22:15.\x* to be fulfilled) said, “I'm thirsty¦80654.”
\p
\v 29 There was a container lying¦80658 there¦80665 full of vinegary wine, so they placed a sponge¦80664 on a hyssop¦80670 stalk¦80670, soaked it in the wine, and held it up to his¦80667 mouth¦80675.
\v 30 After Jesus¦80682 had sucked some wine out, he said¦80683, “It is finished¦80684.” Then he bowed¦80686 his head and gave¦80689 up his spirit¦80692.
\s1 Jesus' side is pierced with a spear
\p
\v 31 Now because it was the preparation¦80697 day\x + \xo 19:31: \xt Jn 19:14.\x* for the coming Rest Day, the Jews didn't want the bodies¦80706 to remain¦80701 on the stakes¦80704 after dusk (because it was even a special Rest Day.) So they asked¦80722 Pilate¦80725 to command for their legs to be broken¦80727 \add to hasten their deaths\add* and then they could be removed \add sooner\add*.
\v 32 So the soldiers¦80737 came¦80733 and broke¦80742 the legs of the men on each side of Jesus,
\v 33 but when they got to him, they saw¦80757 that he was already¦80760 dead so they didn't break his¦80766 legs.
\v 34 Instead one of the soldiers¦80772 stabbed his¦80774 side with a spear¦80773 and immediately¦80782 blood¦80783 and water¦80785 came¦80781 out.
\v 35 The one who actually saw this happen\f + \fr 9:35 \ft Believed to be the author of this account.\f* has testified¦80789 this and his¦80793 account is accurate so that you \add readers\add* can also believe¦80808 it.
\v 36 Because¦80817 these¦80812 things¦80812 also happened to fulfil¦80816 what was written in the scriptures¦80815,\x + \xo 19:36: \xt Exo 12:46; Num 9:12; Psa 34:20.\x* that “none of his¦80821 bones will be broken¦80819,”
\v 37 and in another¦80824 place,\x + \xo 19:37: \xt Zech 12:10; Rev 1:7.\x* “they will look at the one that they pierced¦80830.”
\s1 The wrapping and laying of Jesus' body
\r (Mat. 27:57-61; Mrk. 15:42-47; Luk. 23:50-56)
\p
\v 38 After all of this, Joseph from Arimathea¦80841 went to Pilate. (Joseph was a follower of Jesus, but secretly because¦80849 he was afraid of what the Jewish leaders might do.) He asked¦80834 Pilate for permission¦80861 to remove Jesus' body, and it was granted to him. So they went and got his¦80849 body.
\v 39 \x + \xo 19:39: \xt Jn 3:1-2.\x*Nicodemus (the one who had first¦80889 visited Jesus¦80879 at night¦80887) also came¦80876, bringing¦80890 around 30kg of burial spices.
\v 40 So they took¦80901 Jesus' body¦80904 and wrapped it¦80910 around with linen¦80912 strips with the spices¦80916 as per the Jewish burial customs¦80918.
\v 41 There was a garden out at the place¦80928 where¦80929 Jesus had been executed¦80930, and¦80932 in the garden there¦80924 was a new tomb¦80936 that hadn't been used yet.
\v 42 So because it was the preparation¦80950 day¦80950 and because the tomb¦80957 was nearby, they¦80959 laid his¦80951 body there¦80946.
\c 20
\s1 The body is missing from the chamber
\r (Mat. 28:1-8; Mrk. 16:1-8; Luk. 24:1-12)
\p
\v 1 The following Sunday, Maria¦80968 from Magdala¦80970 went out to the tomb very early¦80972 when it was still¦80974 dark, and¦80980 she saw that the stone¦80983 had been removed from the entrance.
\v 2 So she ran quickly and went to Simon Peter and the other¦81002 intern that Jesus¦81007 loved, and told them, “They've taken the master's¦81013 body out of the tomb¦81016 and we don't know where¦81020 they've put him.”
\p
\v 3 So Peter¦81026 and the other¦81029 intern went out to the tomb¦81035.
\v 4 They were running¦81037 together¦81041, but the other¦81045 intern was a bit faster than Peter¦81051 and so he came¦81053 to the tomb¦81058 first¦81054.
\v 5 Without going in, he stooped¦81061 down at the entrance and looked in and saw the linen¦81065 strips lying¦81063 there¦81063.
\v 6 But Peter came¦81081 along behind him¦81079 and went straight into the tomb¦81084 and also saw the linen¦81088 strips lying¦81089 there¦81089.
\v 7 But the piece of cloth¦81102 that had been on the head wasn't lying¦81103 there¦81103 with the linen¦81102 strips, but¦81104 had been folded and¦81090 placed¦81109 separately¦81105.
\v 8 So now the other¦81115 intern who had arrived first¦81119 also went inside and he saw¦81124 it all and believed¦81126 \add that Jesus had risen\add*.
\v 9 (At that time they¦81129 weren't yet aware of the scripture¦81132 about him¦81135 coming back to life.)
\v 10 So they¦81139 went¦81139 back again¦81141 to their homes.
\s1 Jesus reveals himself to Maria from Magdala
\r (Mat. 28:9-10; Mrk. 16:9-11)
\p
\v 11 But Maria¦81147 had stayed there outside¦81157 the tomb weeping. But when she stooped¦81163 down and looked into the tomb,
\v 12 she saw two¦81169 angels¦81170 dressed in white¦81173 sitting¦81174 there—one at the head end and one at the feet¦81183 end of the slab where¦81184 Jesus'¦81189 body¦81187 had been lying¦81185.
\v 13 They spoke to her¦81192, “Woman¦81194, why are you¦81196 crying?”
\p “Because¦81202 they've taken away my¦81206 master¦81205,” she replied, “and¦81207 I don't know where¦81210 they've put him¦81214.”
\p
\v 14 Then she turned¦81218 back around and saw Jesus¦81226 standing there, but she didn't realise who it was.
\v 15 Jesus¦81239 asked her, “Woman¦81240, why are you crying? Who are you looking for?”
\p Maria assumed he might be the gardener¦81250, so she answered, “Mister, if you took him, tell me where¦81265 you put him and I'll take him away \add for you\add*.”
\p
\v 16 Jesus¦81277 just answered, “Maria¦81279.”
\p She spun around and said, “My teacher!” (‘Rabboni’ in Hebrew.)
\p
\v 17 And Jesus¦81295 said to her¦81322, “Don't touch¦81298 me because I haven't gone back up to the father yet, but go and tell my brothers¦81312 that I'm going up to my father and the father of you all, and my god and the god of you all.”
\p
\v 18 So Maria¦81334 went and told the trainees, “I've seen¦81344 the master¦81347,” and she told them what he'd said¦81351.
\s1 Jesus appears to his followers
\r (Mat. 28:16-20; Mrk. 16:14-18; Luk. 24:36-49)
\p
\v 19 On Sunday evening¦81357 Jesus' trainees had met together and had the doors¦81368 locked because¦81375 they were afraid of the Jewish leaders, but Jesus arrived and stood¦81384 in the middle of the room and said, “Peace¦81391 to you¦81392 all.”
\v 20 Then he showed¦81397 them his hands¦81401 and his side and they were so happy now that they had seen¦81412 the master¦81414.
\v 21 Jesus¦81419 continued, “Peace¦81422 to you all. Now I am sending¦81430 you all out just like the father¦81428 sent¦81425 me out.”
\v 22 Then he breathed¦81437 on them and said¦81436, “Receive¦81442 the pure spirit¦81443.
\v 23 \x + \xo 20:23: \xt Mat 16:19; 18:18.\x*If you forgive¦81449 anyone's sins¦81451, then they'll be forgiven¦81452. If you withhold forgiveness¦81449, then it will be withheld.”
\s1 Thomas sees the evidence for himself
\p
\v 24 But Thomas, one of the twelve¦81471 (nicknamed ‘Twin’), wasn't with them when Jesus¦81483 had come.
\v 25 So the other¦81488 trainees told him, “We have seen¦81491 the master¦81493.”
\p But he replied, “I won't believe¦81555 that unless I see¦81500 the mark of the nails in his hands¦81506 and I can put my finger¦81529 into the marks and can put my hand¦81547 into his side.”
\p
\v 26 Eight days¦81558 later, Jesus' trainees were again¦81560 together inside¦81562, and Thomas was with them.
\v 27 Jesus came and stood in the middle of the room even though the doors were shut, and said, “Peace to you all.”
\p
\v 28 Thomas spoke up, “My¦81628 master¦81627 and my¦81628 god¦81631!”
\p
\v 29 “So you believe now because you've seen me,” said Jesus¦81638. “The ones who haven't seen me, yet who believe anyway, will be receive a reward.”
\s1 Why this document was written
\p
\v 30 Jesus¦81662 went on to do many other¦81657 miracles in front of his¦81666 trainees which¦81667 aren't recorded in this account.
\v 31 But what has been written¦81678 here has been recorded so that you all might believe that Jesus¦81685 is the messiah¦81688, God's son, and then by believing, so that you might have \add true\add* life¦81698 through his¦81704 power.
\c 21
\s1 The miracle of the net full of fish
\p
\v 1 After¦81705 all this, Jesus¦81713 revealed himself again¦81711 to his trainees at Lake Galilee. It happened like this:
\v 2 Simon Peter, Thomas nicknamed ‘Twin’, Nathanael¦81736 from Cana in Galilee¦81744, the sons¦81746 of Zebedee¦81750, and two¦81759 other¦81753 trainees had gathered together¦81727
\v 3 \x + \xo 21:3: \xt Luk 5:5.\x*when Simon Peter said that he¦81782 was going¦81765 fishing¦81766 and the others said that they'd join him¦81768.
\p So they went off and boarded¦81779 the boat¦81783, but they didn't catch anything that night¦81789.
\p
\v 4 When the dawn was approaching, Jesus¦81814 was standing there on the shore¦81806, but they didn't know that it¦81815 was him.
\v 5 Jesus¦81822 called out, “Hey, young fellas. Don't you¦81827 have any fish¦81826?”
\p “None.” they answered¦81828.
\p
\v 6 \x + \xo 21:6: \xt Luk 5:6.\x*Then he said, “Throw the net out over the right¦81839 side of the boat¦81842 and you'll find some.” So they did it and they caught so many fish that the net was too heavy to pull back in.
\p
\v 7 Now the intern that Jesus¦81900 loved said to Peter, “It's the master!” When Simon Peter heard¦81910 that, he put on his robe (because he didn't have it on), and jumped overboard into the lake.
\v 8 The other¦81930 trainees followed in the little¦81934 boat¦81934 dragging¦81951 the net¦81953 behind them because they¦81940 were only about¦81946 100m out from the shore.
\v 9 When they went up the beach, they saw some bread¦81970 there and a charcoal¦81964 fire¦81964 with fish¦81967 cooking on it¦81968
\v 10 and Jesus¦81974 told them, “Bring¦81975 some of the fish¦81979 that you¦81981 just caught¦81981.”
\p
\v 11 So Simon Peter went and dragged¦81989 the net onto the beach. Amazingly it hadn't torn even though it contained 153 large¦82002 fish.
\v 12 Then Jesus said, “Now, come and have breakfast¦82018.” But none of the trainees dared to ask who he was, because they figured it must be the master¦82033.
\v 13 Jesus¦82038 brought the bread¦82042 to them and shared it around, and then likewise¦82051 for the fish¦82050.
\p
\v 14 This was now the third¦82055 time¦82055 that Jesus¦82058 had appeared to his trainees since he'd come back to life.
\s1 Jesus questions Peter
\p
\v 15 While they were eating, Jesus asked Simon Peter, “Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these¦82084?”
\p Peter answered, “Yes, master¦82088, you know that I love you.”
\p Jesus responded, “Feed my¦82102 lambs¦82101.”
\v 16 Then he¦82130 asked again¦82106, “Simon, son of John, do you love me?”
\p Peter replied, “Yes, master¦82120, you know that I love you.”
\p Jesus responded, “Shepherd my¦82133 sheep¦82131.”
\v 17 Then he asked a third time, “Simon, son of John, do you love me?”
\p Peter was now upset that he had been asked a third time if he loved him, and he answered, “Master, you know everything.”
\p Jesus responded, “Feed my¦82180 sheep¦82178.
\v 18 I can assure you that when you were younger¦82188, you dressed yourself¦82190 and went wherever you wanted to go, but as you age, you'll be stretching¦82198 out your¦82203 hands¦82201 and others¦82206 will dress you and will take you where you don't want to go.”
\v 19 When he said this, Jesus was indicating how Peter would die honouring God, and he told Peter, “Keep following¦82241 me.”
\p
\v 20 \x + \xo 21:20: \xt Jn 13:25.\x*When Peter turned¦82243 around he saw that the intern that Jesus loved was following¦82254 them—the one who had leaned on Jesus' chest¦82263 during the supper¦82260 and asked who the one was who would turn Jesus over.
\v 21 Noticing him, Peter asked Jesus¦82287, “Master, what about¦82291 that one?”
\p
\v 22 But Jesus¦82295 replied, “If I want him to stay alive until¦82301 I come back, what business would it¦82303 be of yours? You just stay following¦82309 me.”
\p
\v 23 As a result of that, a rumour went around the others that that one would not die, but Jesus¦82336 never said that. (He only said, “If I want him to stay alive until¦82346 I come back, what business would it be of yours?”)
\s1 Statement of fact
\p
\v 24 This author is the intern that testifies¦82357 about these things—the one who wrote this down and whose account is true.
\v 25 (There were also many other¦82378 things¦82378 that Jesus did, which¦82386 if they were all written down then even the world¦82395 itself¦82392 wouldn't have room for all the books that would need to be written.)
