\mt2 The account of Yeshua's ministry by
\mt1 Yohan
\is1 Introduction
\is2 Author
\ip This account about the works and teachings of Yeshua (Jesus) was written by Yohan, brother of Yacob (mistakenly known in older English Bibles as James). Both of them were in the small group of twelve close followers of Yeshua that he selected as his apprentices and who accompanied him around as he taught. Out of the twelve, Yohan was the one that greatly loved Yeshua, and his closeness gave him much of the insight that he includes with his description of Yeshua's actions and teaching. The two brothers were the sons of Zebedee, and all three of them worked on Lake Galilee as fishermen.
\is2 This account
\ip The \em Open English Translation\em* places Yohan's account before the others because it begins with the eternal existence of Yeshua the messiah. Not only is Yeshua the godly messenger, he was also the creator who has now descended from heaven as a man. Omitting any mention of the baby Yeshua, Yohan does however tell us about Yohan-the-Immerser who came before Yeshua to prepare the people for the arrival of the promised messiah.
\ip In chapters two to twelve it's written how the various miracles that Yeshua did showed that he was the promised messiah who would offer life without ending to anyone who would accept that he had been sent by God and trust in his teaching. Although there were indeed many who did believe in him, many others were unable to come to that point and ended up opposing Yeshua at every turn.
\ip In chapters thirteen to seventeen, the compassion of Yeshua towards his followers is described. He also told them in advance of his impending brutal death.
\ip In the final few chapters, we read about the arrest and judging of Yeshua, his being fastened to a pole and giving up his spirit, his coming back to life, and how his followers saw him and spoke with him again during that period.
\ip Yohan is careful to explain how to receive life without ending by means of believing that Yeshua came down from heaven and obeying his teaching. Yeshua himself is the path and the truth and the life (14:6).

\v 1 In the beginning¦62922 was the message,\f + \fr 1:1 \ft TD: This passage is complex to translate because the message was also the messenger—that is Yeshua came not only to teach about getting saved, but also to become the actual way to be saved!\f* and the message was with God, and the message was \add and is\add* God.
\v 2 The message was with God¦62945 even at the creation¦62942 \add of the universe\add*.
\v 3 Everything came into existence through¦62947 the messenger\f + \fr 1:3 \ft Lit. him.\f*—not even one thing¦62956 came into existence apart from him.
\v 4 He holds life, and that life is the light¦62970 of humankind.
\v 5 And that light¦62975 is shining¦62979 in the darkness, and darkness cannot overcome him.
\p
\v 6 \x + \xo 1:6: \xt Mat 3:1; Mrk 1:4; Luk 3:1-2.\x*A man¦62987 arrived who had been sent¦62988 by God¦62992. His name¦62995 was Yohan¦62997.
\v 7 He came as a testimony¦63003 to tell about the light so that everyone would believe¦63011 the light.
\v 8 Yohan himself wasn't the light—he was merely the announcer of the light.
\v 9 The true light¦63028 which¦63031 enlightens¦63032 every¦63033 person¦63034 was coming¦63035 into the world¦63038.
\p
\v 10 He was in the world and he's the creator of the world, and yet the world didn't even know him.
\v 11 He came¦63060 to his own chosen people, but they wouldn't accept him¦63064,
\v 12 however anyone who would accept him and trusted in his¦63085 authority, he gave¦63072 them the right¦63076 to become¦63079 children¦63077 of God¦63078—
\v 13 not physical children and not coming from human actions, but¦63098 children of God¦63100.
\p
\v 14 And the message¦63105 became¦63107 a human and lived here among¦63110 us and we¦63113 saw¦63113 his¦63116 greatness—the greatness of an only child of the father¦63121—full of grace¦63124 and truth¦63126.
\p
\v 15 Yohan¦63127 explained about him and loudly told everyone, “This is the one I meant when I said¦63138, ‘There's someone coming¦63144 after¦63142 me, yet who came before me, because¦63149 he existed before I did!’ ”
\p
\v 16 Because¦63153 he has so much, we all received¦63162 grace and then even more grace.
\v 17 The commandments came to us through Moses, but grace¦63176 and truth¦63179 came to us through Yeshua¦63181 the messiah¦63182.
\v 18 No one has ever actually seen¦63186 God, but the human son born from God the father¦63201 and in close touch with him, he was the one to explain¦63203 God to us.

\v 19 Yohan¦63211 explained some of this when the Jewish leaders sent¦63213 out priests¦63221 and¦63222 temple workers from Yerusalem¦63220 to ask¦63227 him¦63230, “Who are you¦63232?”
\p
\v 20 He didn't flinch from the truth and so he told them, “I am not the chosen¦63248 messiah¦63248.”
\p
\v 21 \x + \xo 1:21: a \xt Mal 4:5; \xo b \xt Deu 18:15,18.\x*So they asked him again, “Are you Eliyah come back to life?”
\p And he answered, “No, I'm not.”
\p They asked, “Are you the prophet¦63271?”
\p Again he answered, “No, I'm not.”
\p
\v 22 So they asked him¦63280, “Who are you then? We need to give¦63286 an answer¦63285 to the ones who sent¦63288 us. How do you describe yourself¦63294?”
\p
\v 23 \x + \xo 1:23: \xt Isa 40:3 (LXX).\x*So he said, “I am a voice¦63297 shouting¦63298\f + \fr 1:23 \ft We've deliberately omitted putting a comma here, because it's also possible that the comma should go after ‘wilderness’.\f* in the wilderness smooth the path¦63304 of the master¦63305, as the prophet¦63315 Isayah said.”
\p
\v 24 Some of the ones sent¦63318 out were members of the Pharisee¦63322 party¦63322.
\v 25 These ones asked¦63324 Yohan, “So why are you immersing¦63332 people then if you aren't the messiah¦63338 or Eliyah or the prophet¦63345?”
\p
\v 26 He answered¦63346, “I'm immersing¦63352 people in water¦63356, but somewhere here among us all there's someone you don't¦63366 know—
\v 27 the one coming¦63373 after¦63371 me, and I'm not even good enough to untie¦63386 his¦63387 sandal¦63391 straps¦63389!”
\p
\v 28 All this happened in Bethany¦63396 on the east side of the Yordan¦63401 River where¦63403 Yohan¦63406 was immersing¦63407 people.

\v 29 The next day¦63410 Yohan saw Yeshua¦63416 coming¦63417 towards him¦63419, and¦63420 said, “Hey! Here's the sacrificial lamb of God¦63426 who's come to take away the sin¦63431 of the world¦63434.
\v 30 This is the man¦63447 I was talking about when I said¦63441, ‘There's someone coming¦63446 after me, yet who came before me, because¦63452 he¦63455 existed before I did.’
\v 31 I didn't know who he was but¦63460 nevertheless I came¦63468 and immersed¦63473 people in water¦63472 so that this man could be revealed¦63462 to \add all\add* Israel.”
\p
\v 32 And Yohan¦63477 further explained, “I saw God's spirit¦63482 come down and¦63491 settle on him¦63495.
\v 33 I didn't know which one was him, but the one who sent me to immerse people in water¦63509 said, ‘When you see the spirit coming¦63521 down and settling on someone, he is the one who will immerse people with God's holy spirit.’
\v 34 And I have seen¦63538 that, and¦63539 so I can assure you that he¦63544 is God's son.”

\v 35 The next day¦63550, Yohan¦63555 was back there with two¦63561 of his¦63560 apprentices¦63559
\v 36 and noticing Yeshua¦63565 walking¦63566 nearby he said, “Look! There's the \add sacrificial\add* lamb of God¦63572.”
\p
\v 37 When his¦63587 two¦63586 apprentices¦63588 heard¦63582 him say that, they left him and followed¦63593 Yeshua¦63595.
\v 38 But Yeshua¦63599 turned¦63596 and saw them following¦63603 him, and asked them, “\wj What do you two want?\wj*”
\p And they said¦63611 to him, “Teacher¦63619, where do you live?”
\p
\v 39 “\wj Come and see,\wj*” Yeshua replied. So they went with him and saw¦63632 where¦63634 he lived, and then they stayed there that night, because it was already late afternoon.
\p
\v 40 Andrew¦63651, the brother¦63653 of Simon¦63654 Peter was one of those two¦63660 who heard¦63662 Yohan¦63664 and¦63665 then followed¦63666 Yeshua.
\v 41 As soon as he found his brother¦63674, he said to Simon¦63677, “We have found the messiah—God's chosen one,”
\v 42 and led him to Yeshua. When Yeshua saw him, he said¦63702, “\wj Ah, you are Simon¦63706, Yohan's¦63709 son, but from now on you'll be called¦63712 Peter which¦63714 means \it stone\it*.\wj*”

\p
\v 43 The following¦63735 day¦63718, Yeshua¦63734 wanted¦63720 to go to Galilee¦63726. He found Philip and¦63730 told him¦63732, “\wj Follow me!\wj*”
\v 44 Philip was from the town of Bethsaida where Andrew¦63748 and¦63749 Peter lived.
\v 45 Philip then found Nathanael¦63754 and told him¦63757, “We've¦63767 found the one that Moses and the prophets¦63766 wrote¦63759 about in the Scriptures. He's Yeshua¦63768 from Nazareth¦63777.”
\p
\v 46 And Nathanael¦63781 said¦63779, “Does anything good¦63786 come from Nazareth¦63783?”
\p So Philip answered, “Well, come and¦63794 see¦63795 \add for yourself\add*.”
\p
\v 47 Yeshua¦63800 saw¦63796 Nathanael¦63802 approaching and¦63806 said, “\wj Ah, this is an honest Israeli¦63814.\wj*”
\p
\v 48 But Nathanael¦63823 queried him, “Where do you know \em me\em* from?”
\p And Yeshua¦63830 replied, “\wj Actually I saw¦63843 you under¦63840 that fig¦63842 tree¦63842 before Philip had even called you.\wj*”
\p
\v 49 Nathanael¦63847 exclaimed, “Great teacher! You \em are\em* God's son! You're¦63853 the king¦63863 of Israel!”
\p
\v 50 Yeshua¦63869 responded, “\wj So you believe¦63885 this because I said that I had seen you under the fig¦63883 tree¦63883. You'll get to see much greater¦63886 things¦63889 than that!\wj*”
\v 51 \x + \xo 1:51: \xt Gen 28:12.\x*And he continued, “\wj Honestly, I'm telling all of you: you'll be seeing¦63902 the sky opened¦63905 up and God's messengers going¦63911 up and coming¦63913 down on me—humankind's child.\wj*”

\p
\v 1 On the Tuesday\f + \fr 2:1 \ft Or possibly, ‘Three days later’.\f*, there was a wedding¦63925 in Cana in Galilee¦63932, and¦63933 Yeshua's¦63938 mother¦63936 was there
\v 2 and Yeshua¦63944 and¦63946 his¦63949 apprentices¦63948 were also invited¦63940.
\v 3 When the wine ran out at the wedding, his¦63972 mother¦63969 said to him¦63974, “They haven't got any more wine.”
\p
\v 4 Yeshua¦63984 answered, “\wj What does that have to do with us, mother? It's not the time for my¦63995 ministry yet.\wj*”
\p
\v 5 But his¦63999 mother¦63998 told the servants¦64001, “Just do whatever¦64002 he tells you.”
\p
\v 6 Now there were six¦64016 empty stone¦64014 water¦64015 jars there that are used for Jewish purification¦64020 ceremonies. (Each one could hold over 70 litres.)
\v 7 So Yeshua¦64037 told them to fill the jars with water¦64041, and they¦64043 filled¦64043 them up.
\v 8 Then he said, “\wj Ok, now take a sample out and give it to the MC.\wj*” So they took some
\v 9 and when the MC tasted¦64062 the water that had now turned to wine, not knowing¦64071 where¦64072 it had come from he called the groom
\v 10 and exclaimed, “Most people supply the best wine at the beginning \add of the reception\add*, and the cheaper stuff when people are a bit tipsy. But you've kept¦64107 the best wine until¦64111 last!”
\p
\v 11 This event in Cana, Galilee¦64127, was the first of the miracles that Yeshua¦64122 did, and it revealed¦64130 his greatness and his followers¦64140 believed¦64135 that he was from God.

\v 13 \x + \xo 2:13: \xt Exo 12:1-27.\x*By then it was getting close to the time of the Jewish Feast of the Passover, and¦64182 Yeshua¦64189 went¦64183 down to Yerusalem¦64187.
\v 14 There in the temple¦64194, he discovered merchants selling¦64196 cows and sheep¦64201 and doves¦64205, and moneychangers¦64209 sitting¦64210 at their tables.
\v 15 Yeshua formed some cords¦64217 into a whip and drove the sheep¦64228 and cows out of the temple¦64223 grounds, and he overturned¦64244 the tables¦64242—spilling the coins¦64239 of the moneychangers¦64234 onto the ground.
\v 16 He scolded the ones selling¦64251 doves¦64250, saying, “\wj Get them out of here! Don't be making¦64258 my¦64263 father's¦64262 house into a market.\wj*”
\v 17 \x + \xo 2:17: \xt Psa 69:9.\x*That reminded¦64268 his¦64272 followers¦64271 of the scripture: “I'll be filled with zeal for your¦64283 temple.”
\p
\v 18 Then the Jewish leaders responded, “Do a miracle to show that you have the authority to do these¦64300 things¦64300.”
\p
\v 19 \x + \xo 2:19: \xt Mat 26:61; 27:40; Mrk 14:58; 15:29.\x*But Yeshua¦64304 answered¦64302, “\wj Well, destroy this temple¦64310 and I'll raise\f + \fr 2:19 \ft We couldn't easily use \em rebuild\em* here because there's a play on words—see verse 21.\f* it¦64317 again in three¦64314 days¦64315.\wj*”
\p
\v 20 The leaders smirked, “This temple¦64330 took forty-six¦64323 years¦64326 to build, and you reckon that you can raise it¦64340 again in three¦64337 days¦64338?”
\p
\v 21 But Yeshua had been meaning his¦64350 own body¦64349 when he was talking¦64344 about the temple¦64347.
\v 22 In the future when he was actually raised¦64354 from the dead¦64356, his¦64360 followers¦64359 remembered this statement, and they believed¦64367 both the \add Hebrew\add* scriptures¦64369 and Yeshua's¦64377 message¦64372.

\v 1 One night a Jewish leader named Nicodemus who was a member of the Pharisee¦64445 party¦64445
\v 2 came¦64454 to Yeshua and said¦64462, “Teacher, we know that God has sent you as a teacher¦64470, because¦64473 no one could do these¦64475 kinds of miracles if God wasn't with him.”
\p
\v 3 Yeshua¦64494 responded, “\wj I'll tell you frankly that no one can enter God's kingdom¦64512 unless he is reborn.\wj*”
\p
\v 4 Nicodemus questioned, “How can an adult be reborn? A person¦64522 can't just return to their mother's¦64535 womb and¦64539 then get born a second¦64537 time!”
\p
\v 5 But Yeshua¦64544 continued, “\wj Honestly, I'm telling¦64547 you¦64548: unless a person is born from both water¦64555 \em and¦64556\em* the spirit¦64557, they can't enter God's kingdom¦64565.\wj*
\v 6 \wj Someone that's born from a body is flesh \add and bone\add*, but someone that's born from God's spirit is spiritual.\wj*

\p
\v 9 Nicodemus replied, “How can all this even happen?”
\p
\v 10 “\wj You're a Jewish teacher¦64646,\wj*” Yeshua¦64639 answered¦64637, “\wj and yet you¦64652 don't¦64651 know all this?\wj*
\v 11 \wj It's true that we just teach what we know, and explain what we've seen¦64664 ourselves, but you people aren't accepting our¦64669 testimony¦64668.\wj*

\v 16 \wj Because¦64753 in that same way, God¦64756 loves the people of the world enough to cause his only son to be born and to give him¦64773 to the world, so that everyone¦64768 who believes¦64770 this will not die, but¦64777 will live forever.\wj*

\v 19 \wj And this is the verdict: that light has come into the world¦64838, but some people¦64843 love¦64840 the darkness¦64847 more than the light because¦64853 they do evil things,\wj*

\p
\v 27 “None¦65012 of us get anything if it's not being given¦65024 from heaven¦65028,” Yohan¦65007 answered¦65006.

\p
\v 1 When Yeshua¦65219 found out that the Pharisee¦65217 party¦65217 knew¦65210 that he was gaining and immersing¦65224 more followers¦65221 than Yohan¦65226 had,
\v 2 (although actually it wasn't Yeshua¦65229 himself¦65230 that was immersing¦65233 them, but¦65234 his¦65237 trainees that were doing it),
\v 3 he¦65238 left Yudea¦65240 and¦65242 went¦65243 back up to Galilee¦65247.
\v 4 On the way up, he decided to go through Samaria¦65254.
\p
\v 5 \x + \xo 4:5: \xt Gen 33:19; Josh 24:32.\x*By choosing that route, they came to a town in Samaria¦65260 called¦65261 Sukar, which¦65266 was near the place that the \add patriarch\add* Yosef¦65271 had inherited from his¦65274 father Yacob¦65269,
\v 6 and Yacob's¦65280 well was there¦65277. Yeshua¦65283 was tired from all the walking and was sitting¦65289 by the well around midday.
\p
\v 7 A woman¦65305 came from the town to get water¦65310 from the well, and Yeshua¦65314 asked her¦65312 for a drink¦65317
\v 8 since his¦65322 followers¦65321 had gone into the town to buy some lunch.
\p
\v 9 \x + \xo 4:9: \xt Ist 4:1-5; Neh 4:1-2.\x*The woman said to him, “You're a Jew¦65339. How come you're asking me for a drink¦65345 when I'm from Samaria?” (Jews¦65357 don't¦65354 normally associate¦65356 with anyone from Samaria.)
\p
\v 10 Yeshua¦65362 answered¦65360, “\wj If you had recognised God's gift¦65369 and who it is who's asking you for a drink¦65380, you would have asked me and I would have given you \em living¦65391\em* water¦65390 \add to drink\add*.\wj*”
\p
\v 11 But the woman¦65397 countered, “Mister¦65398, you don't even have \add rope and\add* a bucket¦65401 to reach the water in the deep well. How then could you get ‘living¦65421 water’?
\v 12 I doubt that you're greater¦65424 than our¦65429 ancestor Yacob¦65430 who made this well for us and drank¦65445 this water along with his children and his animals.”
\p
\v 13 Yeshua¦65456 responded, “\wj Everyone¦65461 who drinks¦65463 this water¦65466 will get thirsty¦65468 again¦65469,\wj*
\v 14 \wj but whoever¦65470 drinks¦65475 the water that I give them will find a well springing up inside them—springing into eternal¦65508 life¦65507.\wj*”
\p
\v 15 So the woman¦65513 said, “Ok, then. Give me some of that water¦65519 so that I won't get thirsty¦65522 and won't have to keep coming out here to the well.”
\p
\v 16 Yeshua said, “\wj First, go and get your¦65542 husband¦65541 and return here.\wj*”
\p
\v 17 “I don't have a husband!” she retorted.
\p “\wj True enough—indeed you don't,\wj*” Yeshua¦65560 said.
\v 18 “\wj You've had five¦65569 husbands¦65571 and you're not married to the man you're living with, so that was true.\wj*”
\p
\v 19 “Mister¦65590, I can see that you're¦65595 a prophet¦65593,” the woman¦65589 reacted.
\v 20 “Our¦65598 ancestors¦65597 worshipped on this mountain¦65602, but you¦65606 Jews claim that people should only worship there in Yerusalem¦65610.”
\p
\v 21 Then Yeshua¦65621 told her, “\wj You need to believe¦65623 that I was sent from God, woman¦65626, because¦65627 a day is coming¦65628 when everyone will be worshipping¦65643 him neither¦65632 on this mountain¦65636, nor in Yerusalem¦65642.\wj*
\v 22 \wj You people in Samaria don't¦65649 even know who you¦65650 worship, but we do, because¦65655 people will be saved by means of us Jews¦65660.\wj*
\v 23 \wj But a time is coming¦65663, starting even now, when the true worshippers will be worshipping the father in spirit¦65676 and truth¦65678, because¦65680 those are the ones that he is wanting to worship him.\wj*
\v 24 \wj God¦65694 is spirit, and the ones worshipping him must worship in spirit and total honesty.\wj*”
\p
\v 25 The woman¦65711 said, “I'm aware that the messiah is coming¦65716—the chosen one of God. Whenever he appears, he'll teach us everything.”
\p
\v 26 “\wj \em I am\em* the messiah,\wj*” Yeshua¦65731 responded. “\wj Yes, he's speaking¦65735 to you¦65736!\wj*”
\rem /s1 The Disciples Rejoin Jesus
\p
\v 27 After this, his¦65746 followers¦65745 arrived back, and they were astounded that he was speaking with a woman¦65752. However no one dared ask her, “What are you after¦65738?” Or to ask him, “Why are you talking¦65753 with her?”
\p
\v 28 So the woman¦65777 left her¦65774 water¦65773 jar there, and went¦65779 back into the town where she told the people¦65786,
\v 29 “Come and see¦65788 a man¦65789 who knew as much about me as I know myself! He must be the messiah¦65802!”
\v 30 So they¦65810 went out from the town to go and¦65809 see Yeshua.
\p
\v 31 Meanwhile, Yeshua's followers¦65823 encouraged him, “Teacher, here, eat.”
\p
\v 32 But he¦65828 said¦65830, “\wj I've had food to eat¦65835 that you¦65837 don't¦65838 know about.\wj*”
\p
\v 33 This made his followers¦65847 ask each other, “Did you see anyone¦65851 bring him¦65853 something¦65853 to eat¦65854?”
\p
\v 34 “\wj Obeying God who sent¦65868 me is like food to me, and¦65870 I plan to finish his¦65872 work,\wj*” Yeshua¦65858 explained.
\v 35 “\wj Don't you all have a saying about needing to wait four months¦65880 for a harvest? But I'm telling you that you all should open your¦65894 eyes¦65893 and look at the fields¦65898, because¦65899 they're already¦65904 lightening up as harvest time approaches¦65886.\wj*
\v 36 \wj The harvester gets paid with a harvest that will last forever so that the ones who plant and the ones who harvest can all celebrate.\wj*
\v 37 \wj There's truth in the statement¦65934 that one person plants and¦65943 a different person harvests.\wj*
\v 38 \wj I've sent¦65948 you all out to harvest where you haven't worked before—others¦65957 did the groundwork and you benefit from their¦65965 work.\wj*”
\rem /s1 Many Samaritans Believe
\p
\v 39 And many people of Samaria¦65977 came out of that town and believed¦65973 that Yeshua is God because¦65978 the woman¦65982 had told them that he knew everything about her.
\v 40 So¦65999 when they all came¦65995, they asked him to stay in their town and they stayed on there¦66012 for a couple of days¦66014.
\p
\v 41 As a result of his¦66024 teaching, many more believed¦66020
\v 42 so then they told the woman, “We no longer¦66035 believe¦66042 just because¦66036 of what you said, but now that we've heard¦66046 him for ourselves¦66043, we can see that he really is the saviour¦66058 of the world¦66060.”

\v 43 After his two¦66066 days¦66067 in Samaria, Yeshua continued on up to Galilee¦66074.
\v 44 \x + \xo 4:44: \xt Mat 13:57; Mrk 6:4; Luk 4:24.\x*He¦66078 himself¦66075 had told them that no prophet¦66081 gets honoured¦66086 in his own home town¦66085.
\v 45 \x + \xo 4:45: \xt Jn 2:23.\x*When he got to Galilee¦66095, the people accepted him, having¦66102 seen¦66102 everything that he'd done at the feast in Yerusalem¦66109 because¦66116 they had also been down there.
\rem /s1 Jesus Heals an Official's Son
\p
\v 46 \x + \xo 4:46: \xt Jn 2:1-11.\x*So he went again¦66129 to Cana there in Galilee¦66140 where¦66141 he had made the water¦66145 into wine. Now there was a royal¦66152 official¦66152 there, whose¦66153 son in Capernaum¦66158 was ill.
\v 47 When the official heard¦66160 that Yeshua¦66163 was coming¦66164 up from Yudea¦66168 to Galilee¦66171, he went¦66172 and asked him if he would come¦66181 and heal¦66184 his¦66185 son who was dying¦66191.
\v 48 Yeshua¦66195 said¦66192 to him¦66197, “\wj You people won't believe¦66207 unless you see¦66204 miracles and other marvels.\wj*”
\p
\v 49 But the official¦66213 begged him¦66210, “Sir, please come¦66216 before¦66217 my¦66224 child¦66221 dies.”
\p
\v 50 “\wj Go back there and see,\wj*” Yeshua responded. “\wj Your¦66232 son will recover.\wj*”
\p The man¦66237 believed¦66235 what Yeshua had told him, and so he started off.
\v 51 On his way, his slaves¦66257 met him and reported¦66264 that the boy¦66271 was alive and well.
\p
\v 52 So the official asked¦66275 them what time it was that he got better¦66286, and they replied that the fever¦66302 had subsided around 1pm.
\v 53 The father¦66306 knew¦66303 that that was the time when Yeshua had told him that his son would recover, and as a result his whole¦66331 household¦66329 believed¦66325 \add that Yeshua came from God\add*.

\p
\v 1 After¦66350 all this, there¦66352 was another Jewish feast¦66354, so Yeshua¦66360 went¦66358 down to Yerusalem¦66362.
\v 2 In Yerusalem¦66367 at the Sheep Gate, there's¦66363 the Bethsaida pool that has five¦66385 alcoves
\v 3 and a large number of sick, blind¦66397, lame, and paralysed¦66399 people¦66393 lie there in them.
\v 4 ≈
\v 5 One man¦66442 had been there¦66443 for thirty-eight¦66446 years¦66449,
\v 6 and when Yeshua¦66459 noticed him and knew that he'd been there for so long, he asked, “\wj Do you want to get better?\wj*”
\p
\v 7 “Yes mister,” the sick man answered¦66476, “but¦66501 when the water¦66490 starts moving, I don't¦66484 have a companion to lift me into the pool, so someone else always get there before¦66505 me.”
\p
\v 8 Then Yeshua¦66512 said, “\wj Stand up and pick up your¦66520 bedroll and start walking¦66522.\wj*”
\v 9 The man immediately¦66524 stood up, picked up his¦66539 gear, and started to walk¦66541.
\p However, this was the weekly rest day.
\v 10 \x + \xo 5:10: \xt Neh 13:19; Jer 17:21.\x*So the religious leaders said to the man, “Hey! It's against the law for you to carry your¦66568 bedding¦66566 on the rest day¦66557!”
\p
\v 11 But the man answered¦66572, “The person who made me better told me to pick up my bedroll and¦66591 start walking¦66592.”
\p
\v 12 “Oh. Who was it that told you¦66603 to take that stuff and¦66609 start walking¦66610?”
\p
\v 13 But the man who had been healed¦66614 didn't even know who it was, because¦66622 Yeshua¦66624 had quickly left when a crowd¦66627 had formed.
\p
\v 14 Later on, Yeshua¦66639 found the man in the temple¦66644 and told him, “\wj Look, you're better now so don't go on sinning¦66653, because you don't want anything worse¦66656 to happen to you.\wj*”
\p
\v 15 The man¦66666 then went¦66662 and¦66667 told the leaders that it was Yeshua¦66678 who had made him¦66683 better.
\rem /s1 Life Through the Son

\v 16 As a result, the leaders started harassing Yeshua¦66695 because he had done this on a rest day¦66707.
\v 17 But Yeshua just replied, “\wj My¦66717 father¦66716 is working today, and¦66721 so I'm also working.\wj*”
\p
\v 18 Because of this, the leaders became determined that he must be put to death—not just because he broke the rules for the rest day¦66740, but most of all because he was calling¦66745 God his own father¦66743, thus making¦66751 himself¦66750 equal¦66749 to God!
\s1 Authority over life is given to the son
\rem /s1 The Authority of the Son
\p
\v 19 So Yeshua¦66758 responded to them, “\wj I want to tell you all something: The son can't initiate anything¦66790 by himself¦66781. He can only do what he sees his father doing, because¦66798 whatever¦66797 his father is doing, he also does things¦66805 like that.\wj*
\v 20 \wj You see, the father¦66814 loves his son and shows him everything that he's doing¦66827. In fact, he'll be showing him even greater¦66830 things than what he's done already, so that you all will be amazed¦66840.\wj*
\v 21 \wj Because¦66844 the father¦66846 brings the dead back to life, giving them new life, so too the son can give life to anyone who he wants.\wj*
\v 22 \wj The father¦66867 won't be judging¦66868 anyone, but¦66870 has already given¦66874 that task to the son,\wj*
\v 23 \wj so that the people might honour the son like they honour the father. But anyone who is not honouring the son, is also dishonouring the father who sent him.\wj*
\p
\v 24 “\wj I assure you that anyone who hears my¦66907 message¦66906 and believes¦66910 that I was sent by God, will live forever and will not be condemned, but has moved from death¦66928 into life.\wj*
\v 25 \wj I can also assure you¦66935 that a time is coming¦66937, and in fact is here already, when the dead¦66944 will be hearing¦66947 the voice of God's¦66953 son and that voice will bring them back to life.\wj*
\v 26 \wj As the father¦66963 is the source of life, he gave the power of giving life to the son\wj*
\v 27 \wj and gave¦66986 him the authority¦66984 to be the final judge, because¦66992 he is humankind's child.\wj*
\v 28 \wj Don't be surprised at this, because¦66999 a time is coming¦67000 when everyone in their graves will be hearing¦67015 his¦67018 voice¦67017,\wj*

\v 10 But Yeshua¦67545 told them to get all the people¦67548 to sit¦67549 down as there¦67550 was a large grassy¦67553 area. So they all sat¦67559 down—some five¦67570 thousand¦67570 men¦67564 were counted.
\v 11 Then he took the buns and gave¦67580 thanks¦67580 to God, and started passing around both the buns and the fish¦67598, and everyone ate as much as they wanted.
\v 12 Once everyone was full, Yeshua got his¦67607 apprentices¦67606 to collect the left-over fragments¦67612 so as not to waste anything¦67615.
\v 13 So they gathered¦67619 the left-overs and filled¦67623 twelve¦67627 baskets¦67628 with left-over bread.
\p
\v 14 The people¦67643 who had witnessed this and other miracles said, “This really is the prophet¦67659 that God promised to send!”
\v 15 But Yeshua¦67666 knew that they intended to come and grab him to proclaim him as their king¦67680, so he moved out of the crowd and on up the hill.

\p
\v 16 As it¦67695 moved into evening¦67694, Yeshua's apprentices¦67698 went back down to the lake¦67702
\v 17 and having¦67705 boarded¦67705 the boat¦67708, they¦67709 set out across¦67713 the lake¦67715 toward Capernaum¦67717. By then it was dark, and there was still no sign of Yeshua¦67738.
\v 18 Then a strong wind¦67743 hit the lake¦67742 and the water got rough.
\v 19 When they had rowed¦67748 about¦67752 five¦67757 kilometres, they saw Yeshua¦67762 walking¦67763 on top of the lake¦67767 and approaching the boat¦67772, and they were very scared.
\v 20 But he told them, “\wj Don't worry—it's me.\wj*”
\v 21 After that they were willing¦67786 to let him into the boat, and immediately¦67796 the boat was at their arrival place.

\p
\v 22 The next day, the crowd¦67814 looked across¦67818 the lake¦67820 and saw that only one small¦67825 boat had crossed, and they knew that only Yeshua's¦67856 apprentices had boarded that boat and left, and not Yeshua himself.
\v 23 Other boats¦67875 came¦67873 across from Tiberias¦67882 near the place¦67886 where¦67887 they¦67889 had eaten the bread¦67891 after the master¦67894 had given¦67892 thanks¦67892.
\v 24 So when all the people saw¦67898 that Yeshua wasn't around and his¦67913 apprentices¦67912 had left, they went off looking¦67930 for¦67930 Yeshua in Capernaum¦67929.

\rem /s1 Jesus the Bread of Life
\p
\v 25 When they found¦67935 him there across¦67937 the lake¦67939, they queried, “Teacher, how did you get¦67948 here?”
\p
\v 26 “\wj Honestly, I know that you're looking¦67959 for¦67959 me, not because you saw¦67963 miracles,\wj*” Yeshua¦67952 answered¦67949, “\wj but because you all had plenty of food to fill you up.\wj*
\v 27 \wj Don't¦67995 \add just\add* work for the food which goes off, but¦67983 for the food which lasts forever—the food which humankind's child will give to you¦67997 because¦67978 God¦68005 the father¦68002 has put his mark of approval on him.\wj*”
\p
\v 28 Puzzled, they asked him¦68009, “What should we be doing if we want to work for God¦68022?”
\p
\v 29 He answered, “\wj Doing God's work is putting your trust in the one that he¦68031 sent¦68042 here.\wj*”
\p
\v 30 “If so,” they said¦68045, “what miracle will you do for us to see¦68058 so that we can believe¦68060 that you \add came from God\add*? What can \em you\em* do?
\v 31 \x + \xo 6:31: \xt Exo 16:4,15; Psa 78:24.\x*Our¦68066 ancestors¦68065 ate¦68069 the manna¦68068\f + \fr 6:31 \ft Manna was a word that meant ‘stuff’ and referred to some kind of flakes that regularly came down from the sky in the time of Moses and could be eaten as food.\f* out in the wilderness¦68072, just like Moses wrote, ‘He gave¦68081 them bread¦68077 from the sky¦68080 to eat¦68084.’ ”
\p
\v 32 Yeshua¦68089 said to them, “\wj Actually I can tell you that it wasn't Moses who gave¦68096 them bread from heaven, but my¦68107 father¦68106 gives you the real bread from heaven,\wj*
\v 33 \wj because God's¦68123 bread¦68120 is the one who came down from heaven¦68129 and¦68130 who gives life¦68131 to the world¦68136.\wj*”
\p
\v 34 So they¦68137 requested, “Mister¦68141, keep¦68142 giving¦68144 us that bread¦68147.”
\p
\v 35 “\wj \em I am\em* the bread¦68158 that gives life¦68160,\wj*” Yeshua¦68154 answered, “\wj anyone who comes to me will never hunger¦68168, and¦68171 the one believing¦68173 in me, will never be thirsty¦68178 again.\wj*
\v 36 \wj But as I said¦68183 already, although you have seen¦68187 me you refuse to believe¦68192 me.\wj*
\v 37 \wj Everyone¦68194 that the father¦68199 gives to me will come to me, and¦68203 I certainly won't turn away anyone who comes to me,\wj*
\v 38 \wj because I came¦68215 down from heaven¦68219, not to do what I want, but¦68228 to do what the one who sent¦68232 me wants.\wj*
\v 39 \wj And what he wants is for me to not lose anyone that he's given¦68247 to me, but¦68255 to bring them back to life on the last day¦68263.\wj*
\v 40 \wj My¦68276 father¦68273 wants everyone¦68278 who watches me and believes¦68284 in me to live forever, because I will bring them back to life¦68290 on that final day¦68300.\wj*”
\p
\v 41 This little speech made the religious leaders grumble¦68301 about¦68306 him because¦68308 he had said¦68309 that he was the food that came down from heaven¦68318,
\v 42 as they figured out, “This is Yeshua¦68327 the son of Yosef¦68331 and so we know his parents. So how can he say that he came¦68355 down from heaven¦68354?”
\p
\v 43 Yeshua¦68360 scolded them, “\wj Don't be grumbling¦68366 to each other.\wj*
\v 44 \wj No one can join me unless the father¦68378 who sent¦68381 me attracts them, and¦68387 then I'll be bringing them back to life on that final day¦68395.\wj*
\v 45 \x + \xo 6:45: \xt Isa 54:13.\x*\wj The prophets¦68400 wrote that the people will be taught¦68404 by God¦68406. And everyone who's heard¦68411 and¦68415 learned¦68416 from the father¦68414 comes to me.\wj*
\v 46 \wj Not that any person has seen the father—only the one who came from God¦68437 has seen him.\wj*
\v 47 \wj I tell you¦68447 sincerely: the one who believes¦68450 \add in me\add* will live forever.\wj*
\v 48 \wj \em I am\em* the bread¦68459 that gives true life¦68461.\wj*
\v 49 \wj Your¦68464 ancestors¦68463 ate¦68465 manna¦68474 in the wilderness¦68472, but they¦68476 all went on to die.\wj*
\v 50 \wj But \em I am\em* the bread¦68480 that came down from heaven¦68484 and¦68494 anyone¦68489 who eats this will not die¦68497.\wj*
\v 51 \wj \em I am\em* the living bread that came down from heaven¦68508 and if anyone¦68512 eats this bread, he will live through to the next age.\wj*”
\p
\v 52 At this point, the religious leaders began to argue with each other, “How could this man give¦68563 us his¦68569 flesh¦68566 to eat¦68570?”
\p
\v 53 So Yeshua¦68575 explained, “\wj Indeed if you don't¦68582 eat¦68584 my flesh¦68586 and drink¦68593 my blood¦68597, you aren't truly¦68577 alive!\wj*
\v 54 \wj The person who eats my flesh¦68614 and drinks¦68617 my blood¦68621 will gain eternal¦68624 life—I will bring them back to life on that final day¦68633.\wj*
\v 55 \wj For my flesh¦68636 is the true food, and¦68642 my blood¦68644 is the true drink¦68649.\wj*
\v 56 \wj Anyone who eats my flesh¦68688 and drinks¦68690 my blood¦68694 lives in me, and I will live in him¦68700.\wj*
\v 57 \wj The father is alive and sent me here, and I am alive because of Him, so also the person who eats me will be alive because of me.\wj*
\v 58 \wj Unlike your ancestors¦68771 who ate that bread \add from the sky\add* and then died, anyone who eats this bread that came down from heaven¦68764 will live through to the next age.\wj*”
\s1 Many people find the teaching too difficult
\p
\v 59 Yeshua taught¦68796 all of this in the meeting¦68794 hall¦68794 there in Capernaum¦68798.
\rem /s1 Many Disciples Desert Jesus
\rem /s1 The Words of Eternal Life
\v 60 But even many of his¦68806 followers¦68805 who heard¦68802 it said¦68808, “This is difficult teaching—it's too hard to take.”
\p
\v 61 But Yeshua¦68828 already knew inside that his¦68839 followers¦68838 were grumbling¦68834 about¦68835 this and asked them, “\wj Do you¦68845 find this offensive¦68846?\wj*
\v 62 \wj What¦68856 if you were to see humankind's child ascending to where¦68859 he came from?\wj*
\v 63 \wj It's the spirit that is the source of life, not the body. The concepts that I've taught you are all spiritual and life-giving.\wj*
\v 64 \wj But there¦68888 are some here who don't¦68897 believe me.\wj*” Actually, Yeshua¦68907 had already known¦68900 from the beginning¦68904 just who would believe and¦68913 which person would betray him¦68921
\v 65 so he said¦68927, “\wj That's why I told you that no one can come¦68932 to me unless the father¦68944 has given¦68940 them to me.\wj*”
\p
\v 66 After this, many of his¦68954 followers¦68953 went¦68955 back and no longer¦68960 accompanied him around.
\p
\v 67 So Yeshua¦68969 said¦68965 to his twelve¦68971 \add apprentices\add*, “\wj Don't you want to leave as well?\wj*”
\p
\v 68 \x + \xo 6:68-69: \xt Mat 16:16; Mrk 8:29; Luk 9:20.\x*“Master¦68984,” Simon¦68982 answered¦68977, “if we went, who would we follow then? You're the \add only\add* one who teaches about living forever.
\v 69 We believe¦68994 and¦68995 know that you¦68999 are the holy son of God¦69007.”
\p
\v 70 Yeshua¦69013 responded, “\wj Didn't I choose all twelve¦69024 of you myself? And yet one of you is a devil¦69032.\wj*”
\v 71 (He was talking¦69034 about Yudas, Simon¦69038 Iscariot's son, because¦69045 he was the one who would go on to betray him.)

\p
\v 1 After all this, Yeshua¦69063 travelled around Galilee¦69068. (He didn't want to travel around Yudea¦69076 because¦69078 the leaders there wanted to execute him¦69080.)
\v 2 \x + \xo 7:2: \xt Lev 23:34; Deu 16:13.\x*As it¦69084 was now getting close to the Jewish Feast With Tents,
\v 3 his¦69101 brothers¦69100 said¦69094 to him, “You should leave this place and go down to Yudea¦69111 so that all your¦69116 followers¦69115 can see the miracles that you're¦69126 doing¦69126.
\v 4 If you want to become well-known, you don't do things¦69144 out of the main stream. If you want to do miracles, \add go and\add* show yourself¦69147 to the wider world¦69149.
\v 5 (You see, not even Yeshua's own \add half-\add*brothers believed¦69156 \add that he¦69153 came from God\add*.)
\p
\v 6 So Yeshua¦69165 responded, “\wj Well, you guys can do that any time, but it's not the right time for me yet.\wj*
\v 7 \wj All the people won't hate you¦69190 guys, but¦69192 they do hate me because¦69194 I teach about the evil¦69204 things they are doing.\wj*
\v 8 \wj You all go¦69207 on down to Yerusalem ahead of me. I'm not going¦69216 to the feast yet because¦69221 it's not yet the right time¦69226 for me.\wj*”
\v 9 After saying this, Yeshua stayed up in Galilee¦69241.
\s1 Yeshua starts teaching about authentic justice

\p
\v 10 But after his¦69248 \add half-\add*brothers had left to go down to Yerusalem, Yeshua also went—not in the public limelight but just incognito so to speak.
\v 11 However at the celebrations, the Jewish religious leaders were searching for him, and were asking around where he was.
\p
\v 12 Even among¦69286 the crowds¦69289 there¦69284 was a lot of quiet banter with some saying that Yeshua is a good man and others¦69298 complaining that he was misleading the people.
\v 13 Either way, no one was speaking¦69310 out in public¦69309 about him¦69313, because¦69316 they were afraid of the reaction of the religious leaders.
\rem /s1 Jesus Teaches at the Feast
\p
\v 14 Finally sometime in the middle¦69325 of the celebrations, Yeshua¦69330 went¦69327 into the temple¦69333 and¦69334 started teaching¦69335 in there.
\v 15 Even the Jewish leaders were surprised, asking, “How can this man know so much when he¦69339 hasn't been trained as a teacher?”
\p
\v 16 Yeshua¦69352 himself responded, “\wj My teaching¦69357 doesn't come from me, but¦69361 from the one who sent¦69363 me.\wj*
\v 17 \wj If anyone¦69366 wants to do God's will, they'll soon figure out whether¦69377 my teaching¦69376 comes from God or if I'm just making it¦69382 up myself¦69386.\wj*
\v 18 \wj Any person who just teaches their own thoughts is just seeking their own advancement, but¦69399 anyone who wants to promote the one who sent¦69404 them, this is authentic and¦69409 there's no hidden self-interest.\wj*
\v 19 \wj Didn't Moses write down God's commandments for you, yet not a single one of you obeys them. Why are you wanting to execute me?\wj*”
\p
\v 20 “You must be demon-possessed¦69439,” said some in the crowd¦69436, “Who would be wanting to execute you¦69442.”
\p
\v 21 Yeshua¦69448 responded, “\wj I did one miracle and you¦69458 were all amazed¦69458.\wj*
\v 22 \x + \xo 7:22: a \xt Lev 12:3; \xo b \xt Gen 17:10.\x*\wj Moses gave¦69463 you the commandment about circumcision (even though it actually came from before his time), but to obey this, you'll even circumcise a baby boy on the Rest Day.\wj*
\v 23 \x + \xo 7:23: \xt Jn 5:9.\x*\wj So if a \add baby\add* boy can be circumcised¦69487 on the Rest Day so that Moses' commandments aren't broken¦69495, they why did you get angry¦69502 with me because¦69503 I made a man healthy¦69507 on the Rest Day?\wj*
\v 24 \wj Don't just ‘judge’ things so that you yourselves look good, but¦69516 judge impartially, seeking the best for others.\wj*”
\s1 Could Yeshua be the messiah?

\p
\v 25 After this, some of the locals from Yerusalem started asking, “Isn't this the man they¦69532 were wanting to execute?
\v 26 Well, here he is teaching in public¦69536, yet they're not even confronting him. Perhaps¦69544 the leaders know that he really is the messiah¦69556?
\v 27 But we¦69559 even know where this man is from. Surely when the messiah¦69565 comes, no one would know his family background.”
\p
\v 28 So as Yeshua¦69594 continued teaching¦69592, he¦69615 called out, “\wj Indeed you all know me and my home and my family. But I didn't come¦69610 here of my own accord, but the one who sent¦69616 me here is truthful, even though you don't¦69609 even know him.\wj*
\v 29 \wj I know him, because¦69626 I came from him, indeed, he was the one who sent¦69633 me here.\wj*”
\p
\v 30 So now they really want to arrest¦69640 him, but no one touched him because¦69652 it was not yet the proper time.
\v 31 Many in the crowd¦69666 did believe¦69669 that he was from God and they were saying¦69673, “When the messiah¦69677 comes, would he be doing¦69686 greater miracles than what we've seen this man¦69688 do?”

\v 32 The Pharisee¦69694 party heard¦69691 the crowd¦69696 muttering about these¦69701 things¦69701 and sent¦69703 out some of their servants along with the chief¦69707 priests¦69707 to go and arrest¦69715 Yeshua.
\v 33 So Yeshua¦69722 said¦69717, “\wj I'll only be with you¦69728 all for a short while longer and¦69730 then I'll be going¦69731 to the one who sent¦69734 me.\wj*
\v 34 \wj You'll look for me but won't be able to find me, and you can't go where¦69744 I'll be going.\wj*”
\p
\v 35 The leaders wondered, “Where¦69760 could he be going that we wouldn't be able to find him? Will he go and live with the Jews¦69757 living out there among the Greeks and start teaching¦69780 the Greeks?
\v 36 And what does he mean about looking¦69795 for¦69795 him and not being able to find him, and not being able to go where¦69802 he goes?”

\v 37 \x + \xo 7:37: \xt Lev 23:36.\x*On the final climax day¦69813 of the celebrations, Yeshua¦69824 stood¦69822 there and shouted, “\wj Anyone who's thirsty¦69832, come here to me and drink¦69838.\wj*
\v 38 \x + \xo 7:38: \xt Eze 47:1; Zech 14:8.\x*\wj Whoever¦69848 trusts me will have rivers of living¦69855 water¦69854 flowing¦69853 out from him¦69852 just like the scriptures¦69847 say.\wj*”
\v 39 He was talking about God's spirit that the ones who trust him would receive¦69867 in the future—not yet because¦69884 Yeshua¦69886 hadn't been lifted up to heaven yet.

\v 40 When some in the crowd¦69895 heard¦69899 his teaching, they¦69907 said, “He really is the \add coming\add* prophet¦69914.”
\v 41 Others¦69915 said, “He must be the messiah.”
\p But some pointed out, “The messiah won't come from Galilee¦69932.
\v 42 \x + \xo 7:42: \xt 2Sam 7:12; Mic 5:2.\x*Don't the scriptures¦69939 say that he'll be a descendant of King David and¦69947 that he'll come from David's town of Bethlehem¦69949?”
\v 43 And so the crowd¦69971 was divided about Yeshua.

\v 45 So when the servants returned back to the chief¦70002 priests¦70002 and the Pharisees, they were asked, “Why haven't you¦70013 brought¦70013 him¦70016?”
\p
\v 46 They answered¦70017, “We've never¦70024 heard anyone speak like he¦70021 does.”
\p
\v 47 “Don't tell us that you've also been taken in by him?” the Pharisees asked them.
\v 48 “None of our leaders or any of us Pharisees believe¦70050 that he's from God.
\v 49 But all these people ignorant of the scriptures are bewitched.”
\p
\v 50 \x + \xo 7:50: \xt Jn 3:1-2.\x*Now Nicodemus (the one who had previously visited Yeshua) spoke up,

\v 12 \x + \xo 8:12: \xt Mat 5:14; Jn 9:5.\x*Because of this, Yeshua¦70400 told them, “\wj \em I am\em* the light of the world¦70412—whoever follows¦70414 me won't walk in the darkness¦70423 but will have the light of life¦70430.\wj*”
\p
\v 13 \x + \xo 8:13: \xt Jn 5:31.\x*Some from the Pharisee¦70435 party¦70435 argued, “You are testifying¦70439 about¦70437 yourself¦70438, so that testimony¦70441 is invalid.”
\p
\v 14 Yeshua¦70448 responded, “\wj Even when I am testifying about¦70457 myself¦70458, my¦70465 testimony¦70464 is valid, because¦70468 I know where I came¦70471 from and where I'm going.\wj*
\v 15 \wj You all are judging according¦70486 to your earthly values. I'm not judging anyone.\wj*
\v 16 \wj But even if I was judging, my judgement would be correct, because¦70509 it wouldn't just be me judging, but also the father¦70520 who sent me.\wj*
\v 17 \x + \xo 8:17: \xt Deu 19:15.\x*\wj It's even written¦70528 in your¦70527 own laws that the testimony¦70535 of two¦70532 men¦70533 is valid.\wj*
\v 18 \wj So that's me testifying about myself¦70544, plus the father¦70553 who sent¦70551 me also testifies about me.\wj*”
\p
\v 19 “And where is your¦70561 father?” they asked.
\p Yeshua¦70564 answered¦70562 them, “\wj You don't know either me or my father. If you did know me, then you'd also know my father.\wj*”
\p
\v 20 He explained all this while he was teaching¦70597 in the treasury¦70596 part of the temple¦70600, but no one arrested¦70603 him because¦70605 the time for his¦70610 \add suffering\add* had not yet arrived.

\p
\v 21 So he continued, “\wj I will be going away and all of you will be looking¦70621 for¦70621 me, but you'll all just die in your¦70629 sins and won't be able to go where¦70631 I'll be going.\wj*”
\p
\v 22 This puzzled the Jewish teachers, “Surely¦70643 he's not going to commit suicide! What else could he mean about ‘you can't go where I'm going to be going’?”
\p
\v 23 Yeshua explained, “\wj All of you¦70673 are from the world below¦70665, but I'm from the world above¦70671. You all are part of this world, but I'm not part of it.\wj*
\v 24 \wj That's why I said that you'll be dying in your sins, because¦70698 if you refuse to believe¦70700 that I am \add God\add*, you will indeed all be dying in your sins.\wj*”
\p
\v 25 “So who are you?” they asked.
\p And he¦70727 answered, “\wj Still just the same as I've been telling you from the beginning¦70728.\wj*
\v 26 \wj I have a lot that I need to tell you¦70739 all and to judge many of your actions, because the one who sent¦70746 me is true, and it's what I hear from him¦70756 that I speak to all people.\wj*”
\p
\v 27 (They didn't realise that he was talking¦70771 to them about¦70767 the father¦70768 \add in heaven\add*.)
\v 28 So Yeshua¦70780 told them, “\wj When you all lift up\f + \fr 8:28 \ft lifted up / exalted: There's a play on words here. See https://bibleDifferences.net/2019/04/25/156-exulted (dead link???)\f* humankind's child \add on a pole\add*, then you will know that I am \add God\add*, and that I don't do anything by myself¦70797, but I say all this just as the father¦70809 told me to.\wj*
\v 29 \wj And the one who sent¦70816 me is with me—he didn't just leave me alone¦70824—because¦70830 I am continually doing¦70835 what pleases¦70833 him.\wj*”
\p
\v 30 After he'd said all this, many people believed¦70841 in him.

\v 31 Because of this, Yeshua¦70847 told all the Jews¦70852 who believed¦70850 in him¦70851, “\wj If you all continue to believe my message¦70859, then you're my true followers¦70864.\wj*

\p
\v 33 \x + \xo 8:33: \xt Mat 3:9; Luk 3:8.\x*But some queried, “We are Abraham's descendants and¦70885 we've never been slaves to anyone, so how can you¦70893 say that we'll be set free?”
\p
\v 34 “\wj I can assure you all that anyone who sins is a slave¦70914 to sin,\wj*” Yeshua¦70903 answered¦70899.
\v 35 “\wj And the slaves¦70920 don't¦70921 necessarily remain in the \add family\add* home forever—only the children have that right.\wj*
\v 36 \wj So if the son sets you free, then you'll be truly free.\wj*
\s1 Yeshua spars with the Jewish religious leaders
\p
\v 37 “\wj Yes, I know that you're all descendants of Abraham¦70955, but you're trying to kill¦70960 me because¦70962 my message¦70964 doesn't lodge in you.\wj*
\v 38 \wj Indeed I talk about what I've actually seen with the father, but you all are doing¦70999 what you've heard¦70990 from your father.\wj*”

\p And Yeshua¦71017 responded, “\wj Well, if you really were descendants of Abraham, you'd behave more like him¦71005.\wj*
\v 40 \wj But instead you're trying to find a way to have me killed—to kill the man¦71036 who has spoken¦71041 the truth to you—truth that I heard¦71045 from God¦71049. Abraham¦71051 never did that.\wj*
\v 41 \wj You're doing¦71056 what \em your¦71061\em* father wants you all do to.\wj*”
\rem /s1 The Children of the Devil
\p But they shot back, “It's not us who was conceived by a couple that weren't even married! Anyway, we only have one father and that's God¦71078.”
\p
\v 42 “\wj If God was your¦71091 father¦71089 you all would¦71094 be loving¦71093 me,\wj*” Yeshua¦71083 responded, “\wj because¦71097 I came¦71102 from God and for God. I didn't just come¦71112 by myself¦71110, but God sent¦71117 me here.\wj*
\v 43 \wj Why can't you comprehend what I'm saying? The reason¦71119 that you can't stand listening to my message¦71133\wj*
\v 44 \wj is because you come from your father, the devil¦71141, and you want to do what \em your\em* father wants. But he was a murderer¦71152 from the beginning¦71155, and doesn't stick to the truth because there's no truth in him. Whenever¦71170 he tells lies, he's speaking from his own nature, because he's a liar and the source of lying.\wj*
\v 45 \wj But because¦71187 I'm speaking¦71190 the truth¦71189, you¦71194 don't¦71193 believe¦71194 in me.\wj*
\v 46 \wj Which¦71197 of you can scold me for my sins? If I am speaking¦71208 the truth¦71207, why don't¦71212 you believe¦71213 I'm from God?\wj*

\p
\v 48 The Jewish leaders asked, “Aren't we right¦71245 in saying¦71246 that you're¦71253 from Samaria¦71251 and that you have a demon¦71255?”
\p
\v 49 “\wj No, I don't¦71264 have a demon¦71263,\wj*” Yeshua¦71259 answered¦71257, “\wj but¦71266 I honour¦71267 my¦71271 father¦71270 and¦71272 you're dishonouring¦71274 me.\wj*
\v 50 \wj But I'm not searching greatness for myself—my¦71282 father is the one searching and¦71286 the one judging¦71287.\wj*
\v 51 \wj I can assure you¦71291, that anyone¦71295 who puts my teaching into practice can be certain to avoid death¦71303 in \add this\add* age.\wj*”
\p
\v 52 “Now we \em know\em* that you have a demon¦71321!” the Jews¦71317 said¦71312. “Abraham¦71323 and the prophets¦71327 all died¦71324, but you're¦71322 saying¦71330 that those who follow your teaching can be certain to avoid death¦71347 in \add this\add* age.
\v 53 How could you be greater¦71353 than our¦71357 ancestor Abraham¦71358 who died? Even the prophets¦71364 died. Who do you think you are?”
\p
\v 54 Again Yeshua¦71373 answered¦71371, “\wj If I praise myself¦71377, my praise is worthless, but it's my father¦71385 who praises me—the one who you¦71391 say is your God¦71395\wj*
\v 55 \wj although in fact you don't¦71400 even know him. But I have known him, and so I can't say that I haven't known him or I'd be a liar like all of you. But I have known him and I am putting his¦71429 desires into practice.\wj*
\v 56 \wj Your¦71434 ancestor Abraham¦71431 would have been excited to see me here—in fact he did see ahead and was very happy about it.\wj*”
\p
\v 57 Because of that, the Jewish leaders asked, “You aren't even fifty¦71454 years old yet. How could you have seen¦71461 Abraham?”\f + \fr 8:57 \ft Abraham lived some 2,000 years before Yeshua.\f*
\p
\v 58 Yeshua¦71469 answered, “\wj I can assure you¦71473 that \em I am\em*\f + \fr 8:58 \ft This awkward English is necessary to catch the play on words, because ‘I am’ is the meaning of \em Yahweh\em*, the name of God.\f* before¦71474 Abraham¦71475 ever existed.\wj*”
\p
\v 59 When they heard that, they picked up rocks¦71482 to throw¦71484 at Yeshua \add to kill him¦71486\add*. But Yeshua became hidden¦71489 from their sight, and went on out of the temple¦71494.

\rem /s1 A Man Born Blind Receives Sight
\p
\v 1 As Yeshua was walking along, he¦71506 saw¦71506 a man¦71507 who had been blind¦71508 from birth¦71510
\v 2 and his followers¦71516 asked¦71513 him, “Honoured teacher, why was this man¦71522 born blind¦71529? Was it because he himself sinned¦71521, or his parents¦71526?”
\p
\v 3 Yeshua¦71534 answered¦71532, “\wj It wasn't that either this man¦71536 or his¦71541 parents¦71540 sinned¦71537, but it was so that God¦71548 can work in him for others to see.\wj*
\v 4 \wj As long as it's daytime, we need to do what the one who sent¦71560 us wants, but when nighttime¦71568 comes, no one will be able to work.\wj*
\v 5 \x + \xo 9:5: \xt Mat 5:14; Jn 8:12.\x*\wj As long as I'm here in this world, I am the light¦71580 of the world.\wj*”
\p
\v 6 After he'd said¦71585 this, Yeshua spat on the ground¦71587 and after mixing some clay into a slurry, he spread¦71595 it on the eyes¦71604 of the man
\v 7 and told him¦71610 to go and wash in the Siloam Pool.\f + \fr 9:7 \ft Siloam means ‘to be sent out’.\f*
\p
\v 8 Then the neighbours¦71633 of the man and others who had seen him earlier¦71640, knowing that he was a beggar¦71642 asked, “Isn't he the one who always sat and begged here?”
\p
\v 9 And indeed, some were saying, “Yes, this is him.” But others¦71658 were saying, “No, but he looks quite similar¦71665.”
\p And the man said, “I \em am\em* him.”
\p
\v 10 So they¦71674 asked him¦71681, “Well, how come that now you¦71687 can see?”
\p
\v 11 “A man named Yeshua¦71698 made a slurry,” he said, “and spread¦71702 it on my eyes and told me to go and wash at Siloam Pool. So I went and did it, and when I washed¦71725 my eyes, I could see.”
\p
\v 12 “Where¦71736 is he now?” they¦71732 asked.
\rem /s1 The Pharisees Investigate the Healing
\p “I don't¦71741 know,” said¦71732 the man.
\s1 The Pharisees can't accept the healing of the blind man
\p
\v 13 Then they brought the man¦71751 who had been blind¦71751 to the Pharisees.
\v 14 Now, it¦71752 had been the Rest Day when Yeshua¦71764 had made the slurry and¦71765 enabled him¦71769 to see,
\v 15 and because of this, some in the Pharisee¦71779 party¦71779 asked him how it was that now he could see. And he answered, “Well, he put a slurry on my¦71790 eyes¦71794 and when I washed¦71797 them, I could see.”
\p
\v 16 “Well clearly that man is not from God¦71815,” some of them said, “because¦71818 he doesn't respect the Rest Day.”
\p However others said, “But if he's just a sinner, how could he do miracles like that?”
\p
\v 17 So they asked the man who had been blind¦71846, “Well, what do \em you\em* have to say because¦71857 it was your¦71860 eyes¦71862 that he opened¦71858?”
\p “He must be a prophet¦71867,” the man said.
\p
\v 18 But some of the Jews¦71873 weren't even sure that he really had been blind¦71879 before and could now see, so they called¦71885 for his¦71890 parents¦71889
\v 19 and asked¦71895 them, “You two say that this is your¦71905 son and that he was born blind¦71910. If so, how come that now he can see?”
\p
\v 20 His¦71925 parents¦71924 answered¦71919, “We know that he's our¦71935 son, and we know that he was born blind¦71938.
\v 21 But as for how come he can now see, we don't¦71945 know that. Nor do we know who healed his¦71951 eyes¦71954. But ask¦71965 him—he's old enough to speak¦71970 for himself¦71969.”
\v 22 (His¦71976 parents said these¦71971 things¦71971 because they were afraid of the Jewish religious leaders, because the leaders had already¦71981 announced that anyone¦71990 who said that Yeshua was the messiah¦71994 would get banned from all religious ceremonies,
\v 23 so that's why they had said¦72003, “He's old enough—just ask¦72010 him.”)
\p
\v 24 So the leaders summoned the man born blind¦72024 a second¦72019 time and commanded him, “Only praise God¦72032 himself for this, because we know that that man is a sinner¦72041.”
\p
\v 25 “Well, I don't¦72051 know whether or not he's a sinner¦72049,” replied the man. “All I know is that I used to be blind¦72057 but now I can see.”
\p
\v 26 “What did he do to you?” they asked again. “How did he open your¦72077 eyes¦72079?”
\p
\v 27 And he answered¦72084, “I already¦72088 told you that, and you didn't even listen. Why do you want to hear¦72097 it all over again¦72094? Do you guys all want to become¦72106 his¦72103 followers¦72104 as well?”
\p
\v 28 Then they¦72110 insulted¦72110 him¦72112 and¦72113 said¦72115, “\em You\em* might be a follower¦72118 of that man, but¦72124 \em we¦72122\em* are followers¦72128 of Moses.
\v 29 We know that God¦72137 spoke¦72134 to Moses, but¦72145 we¦72147 don't¦72146 even know where¦72148 this other fellow is from.”
\p
\v 30 “Wow, that's pretty amazing,” the man responded. “That man opened¦72175 up my¦72178 eyes¦72180, and you teachers don't¦72169 even know where¦72171 he's from!
\v 31 We know that God¦72186 doesn't listen to sinners¦72184, but he listens to those who worship him and do what he wants.
\v 32 In all the centuries past we never heard¦72207 that a person could give sight to someone who was born blind¦72215.
\v 33 If this man¦72221 isn't from God¦72223, surely he¦72228 wouldn't be able to do that!”
\p
\v 34 They reacted, “You're just an ignorant sinner, and you think you can teach¦72248 \em us\em*!” Then they had him thrown¦72251 out of the room.

\v 35 Yeshua¦72259 heard¦72256 that they had thrown¦72261 out the man who could now see, and when he found¦72266 him, he said¦72270, “\wj Do you believe¦72273 that humankind's child \add came from God\add*?\wj*”

\v 24 when he was surrounded¦72887 by the Jewish religious leaders and interrogated, “How long do you plan to keep us in suspense¦72902 for? If you are the messiah¦72907, just tell us clearly.”
\p
\v 25 “\wj I already told you all,\wj*” Yeshua¦72916 answered¦72913, “\wj but you didn't believe¦72922 me. The miracles that I do with the authority of my¦72936 father¦72935 testify¦72941 about me,\wj*
\v 26 \wj but you don't¦72947 accept¦72948 what the miracles point to because¦72949 you aren't part of my flock.\wj*
\v 27 \wj My¦72968 sheep¦72963 listen to my¦72968 voice¦72967, and I know them and they¦72976 follow¦72976 after¦72977 me.\wj*
\v 28 \wj I give them life¦72983 which will never end so they¦72988 won't ever be destroyed, and no one will be able to snatch¦72996 them away from me.\wj*
\v 29 \wj My¦73006 father is the one who gave¦73010 them to me, and he's more powerful than any other, so no one can snatch¦73023 them away from him.\wj*
\v 30 \wj The father¦73033 and¦73031 I are one.\wj*”
\p
\v 31 Again the Jewish leaders picked up rocks to throw at him to kill him
\v 32 but Yeshua¦73050 asked them, “\wj I showed¦73055 you all many miracles from my¦73062 father¦73061. Which miracle do you want to kill me for?\wj*”
\p
\v 33 \x + \xo 10:33: \xt Lev 24:16.\x*They answered¦73073, “It's not for any \em good¦73080\em* deed that we think you deserve to die, but because¦73089 you, a human¦73091, dishonour God¦73096 by claiming to be him¦73075.”
\p
\v 34 \x + \xo 10:34: \xt Psa 82:6.\x*Yeshua¦73100 answered¦73097, “\wj Isn't it¦73105 written¦73106 in your¦73114 scriptures that God said¦73117, ‘You all are gods¦73119’?\wj*
\v 35 \wj Now the scriptures¦73138 can't be wrong, and¦73133 if the ones who heard teaching from God¦73131 were called¦73123 gods¦73124,\wj*
\v 36 \wj why are you¦73148 telling the one that the father¦73141 blessed and¦73143 sent¦73144 out into the world¦73147 that I am insulting¦73151 God because¦73152 I said¦73153 that I'm God's son?\wj*
\v 37 \wj If I'm not doing¦73162 my¦73167 father's¦73166 work, then you don't¦73161 need to believe¦73169 that he sent me,\wj*
\v 38 \wj but if I am doing¦73173 his work, even if you don't¦73176 believe that he sent me, at least believe in what I do so that you all can know that the father is in me and I'm in the father.\wj*”
\p
\v 39 That was enough that they tried yet again¦73211 to arrest¦73212 him, but he was able to get out and away from their¦73218 influence.
\p
\v 40 \x + \xo 10:40: \xt Jn 1:28.\x*Then Yeshua crossed the Yordan¦73225 river to the place¦73228 where¦73230 Yohan¦73232 had immersed¦73236 the people, and he stayed there¦73240.
\v 41 Many people visited him there, and they were saying¦73247 that even though Yohan¦73249 had never done even one miracle, on the other¦73258 hand everything that he had said about Yeshua was true,
\v 42 and many people there¦73275 believed¦73271 that Yeshua was from God.
\c 11
\s1 Yeshua is aware of Lazarus' death from afar
\rem /s1 The Death of Lazarus
\p
\v 1 \x + \xo 11:1: \xt Luk 10:38-39.\x*Now there was a man¦73278 called Lazarus¦73281 who lived in the village¦73286 of Bethany¦73283 along with his sisters¦73294 Martha¦73291 and¦73289 Maria¦73288.
\v 2 \x + \xo 11:2: \xt Jn 12:3.\x*(Maria¦73302 was the one who \jmp later|link-href="#C12V3"\jmp* poured fragrant oil over Yeshua and¦73308 wiped¦73309 his¦73312 feet¦73311 with her¦73315 hair¦73314.) But now their brother¦73319 was seriously ill
\v 3 and so the two sisters¦73331 sent¦73325 a message to Yeshua saying¦73338, “Master¦73340, this man that you¦73343 love is seriously ill.”
\p
\v 4 However, when Yeshua¦73348 got the message he said¦73349 \add to those around him\add*, “\wj This sickness¦73352 won't end in death¦73357 but in honour for God¦73363, so that his son will also be honoured because¦73359 of it.\wj*”
\p
\v 5 Now it was true that Yeshua¦73378 loved the three of them.
\v 6 Yet when he heard¦73394 that Lazarus was sick, he stayed in the place¦73407 where he was for two¦73408 more days¦73409
\v 7 before he said to his followers¦73417, “\wj It's time to head down to Yudea¦73422 again¦73424.\wj*”
\p
\v 8 But they double-checked, “Honoured teacher, the Yudeans wanted to execute you, so do you really want to go back there¦73440 again¦73438?”
\p
\v 9 And Yeshua¦73443 answered¦73441, “\wj There are twelve hours¦73447 of light in the day. Anyone who walks during the daytime doesn't stumble¦73463 because¦73464 he is seeing¦73471 the light of this world¦73468.\wj*
\v 10 \wj But anyone¦73474 who walks at night¦73478 will stumble¦73479, because¦73480 the light¦73482 is not in them.\wj*”
\v 11 And he continued, “\wj Our¦73499 friend¦73498 Lazarus¦73495 has fallen¦73500 asleep¦73500, but I'm going¦73503 so that I can wake him up.\wj*”
\p
\v 12 But his followers¦73514 objected, “Master¦73517, \add it's good\add* if he's sleeping because it helps with healing.”
\p
\v 13 But Yeshua¦73526 had spoken¦73523 about Lazarus' death¦73530—not just normal sleep as they had thought.
\v 14 So Yeshua¦73549 told them plainly¦73550, “\wj Lazarus¦73551 is dead\wj*
\v 15 \wj and I'm glad that I wasn't there¦73565, because¦73558 you all will benefit as your¦73558 faith grows. Anyway, let's get moving.\wj*”
\p
\v 16 Thomas (nicknamed ‘Twin’) grumbled to the others, “Yeah, we might as well go so that we can get killed as well.”

\p
\v 17 So when they eventually arrived, Lazarus body had already¦73599 been in the burial chamber for four¦73598 days¦73600.
\v 18 The village of Bethany¦73610 was less than three kilometres from Yerusalem¦73613,
\v 19 so many of the Yudeans from there had come¦73626 out to console¦73636 Martha¦73631 and¦73632 Maria¦73634 after the death of their¦73639 brother¦73640.
\p
\v 20 As soon as Martha¦73644 heard¦73646 that Yeshua¦73649 had arrived, she went out to meet him, but Maria¦73653 stayed behind where she was sitting¦73661 in the house¦73658.
\v 21 Martha¦73666 cried, “Yeshua¦73669, master¦73671. If you'd been here, my¦73681 brother¦73680 wouldn't¦73677 have died¦73678,
\v 22 because I already know that anything that you ask from God¦73698, he will give it to you.”
\p
\v 23 Yeshua¦73706 responded, “\wj Your¦73711 brother¦73710 will come back to life.\wj*”
\p
\v 24 “Yes, I know that he'll come back to life at the resurrection¦73722 on the last day¦73726,” said Martha¦73715.
\p
\v 25 But Yeshua¦73732 continued, “\wj \em I am\em* the resurrection¦73736 and¦73737 the life¦73739. Anyone who believes¦73741 that I'm from God, even if they die¦73745 they'll still be living¦73746,\wj*
\v 26 \wj and everyone¦73749 who's alive and believes that I was sent from God, will not die¦73758 in the \add next\add* age.\wj*”
\p
\v 27 Martha replied, “Yes, master¦73769, I do believe¦73772 that you're¦73775 the messiah¦73778, God's son, the one sent into this world¦73786.”
\s1 Yeshua weeps with his close friends
\rem /s1 Jesus Weeps
\p
\v 28 After saying this, Martha went¦73793 and quietly called¦73795 her¦73799 sister¦73798 Maria¦73796, “The teacher¦73807 is on his way¦73793 and he wants to see you.”
\v 29 So Maria quickly¦73819 got up and¦73820 went to find him¦73824.
\v 30 At that stage, Yeshua¦73831 hadn't yet come¦73829 into the village¦73835 proper, but¦73836 was still¦73838 at the edge where¦73843 Martha¦73847 had met him¦73845.
\v 31 The Yudean people who'd been sitting with Maria¦73863 in sympathy there in the house¦73857, when they saw her get up quickly¦73866 and go out, they assumed that she was going¦73879 to the cemetary to weep there.
\p
\v 32 But when Maria¦73890 found Yeshua¦73896, she¦73892 knelt at his¦73903 feet¦73907 and said, “Master¦73911, if you'd been here my¦73919 brother¦73922 wouldn't have died¦73920.”
\p
\v 33 Now when Yeshua¦73924 saw¦73927 her weeping there, along with the others that had followed also weeping, he himself¦73953 was quite affected and groaned¦73944 inside,
\v 34 but he just asked, “\wj Where¦73956 has he been laid?\wj*”
\p “Master¦73962, come and see¦73965,” they replied.
\p
\v 35 Then Yeshua¦73969 \add broke down and\add* wept,
\v 36 which made the others comment, “See how much he cared about him.”
\p
\v 37 But some of them mocked, “This is the man who could make a blind¦73997 man see again, yet how come he wasn't able to stop this man from dying!”

\p
\v 38 So Yeshua¦74004 who was still holding back sobs, went to the cemetary. Lazarus' body had been placed in a cave with a stone¦74022 blocking it,
\v 39 and Yeshua¦74028 instructed them to take away the stone¦74031.
\p Martha¦74041 (the sister¦74037 of the dead man) spoke up, “Master¦74042, the stink¦74044 will be bad because¦74046 it's already¦74043 been four days.”
\p
\v 40 But Yeshua¦74051 responded, “\wj Didn't I tell you that if you would believe¦74057, then you would see God's power?\wj*”
\v 41 So they took¦74065 the stone¦74069 away and Yeshua¦74078 looked upwards¦74083 and said¦74085, “Father¦74086, I thank¦74087 you that you listen to me.
\v 42 Actually I know that you always¦74096 hear¦74098 me, but I said¦74105 that for the sake of these people so that they will believe¦74107 that it¦74105 was you who sent¦74111 me here.”
\v 43 After saying that, he¦74117 shouted, “\wj Lazarus¦74120, come¦74122 out!\wj*”
\v 44 Then the man who had died¦74128 \add slowly\add* shuffled out—still with linen¦74139 strips¦74139 wrapped around his hands¦74137 and his feet¦74132, and a cloth wrapped around his face¦74142.

\p
\v 45 Because of that, many of the Yudeans believed¦74181 that Yeshua was from God after having followed Maria¦74171 and¦74172 seeing what Yeshua did.
\v 46 But others went¦74188 and¦74193 told the Pharisee¦74192 party¦74192 what Yeshua¦74203 had done.
\v 47 So the chief¦74207 priests¦74207 and the Pharisee¦74210 party¦74210 called a formal meeting and asked, “What should we¦74216 do because¦74218 this man¦74221 is doing many miracles.
\v 48 If we allow¦74229 him to continue like this, all the crowds will be believing¦74233 he's the messiah, and then the Romans will come and destroy both our temple and our governance.”
\p
\v 49 But one of them, Caiaphas who was chief¦74262 priest¦74262 that year¦74265, spoke up, “You don't¦74270 know anything.
\v 50 Don't you all realise that its better for all of us if one man¦74282 dies so that the people¦74286 and the nation¦74291 won't be destroyed?”
\v 51 (He didn't say this from his own thinking, but being¦74302 chief¦74301 priest¦74301 that year¦74304, he was announcing God's message that Yeshua¦74313 was going¦74311 to die for the nation¦74318,
\v 52 and¦74319 not only for this nation¦74323, but¦74325 for all of God's children¦74329 scattered¦74334 around the world to become united.)
\p
\v 53 As a result, from that day¦74344 on they decided that Yeshua needed to be executed.
\v 54 Because of that, Yeshua¦74354 no longer¦74355 walked around Yudea in public¦74356, but¦74361 went¦74362 out to the town of Ephraim¦74372 out in the wilderness¦74370 and¦74375 stayed there¦74352 with his followers¦74382.
\rem /s1 The Passover in Jerusalem
\p
\v 55 At that time, the Jewish Passover celebrations were approaching, and¦74393 many people from the regions¦74402 went¦74394 to Yerusalem¦74398 ahead of the celebrations to purify¦74410 themselves¦74411.
\v 56 They were looking¦74412 out for Yeshua¦74416 and as they stood¦74425 around in the temple¦74424, they asked each other, “What do you think? Surely he won't come¦74434 to the celebrations.”
\v 57 The chief¦74443 priests¦74443 and the Pharisee¦74446 party¦74446 had already announced that if anyone¦74453 knew where¦74456 Yeshua was, they must inform them so that they could arrest¦74461 him¦74462.

\p
\v 1 Because of this, Yeshua¦74465 went to Bethany¦74474 six days¦74469 before¦74466 the Passover. This was where¦74475 Lazarus¦74477 lived, the one he had brought back to life.
\v 2 So they prepared dinner for him there¦74493 and Martha¦74496 was serving¦74497 and Lazarus¦74502 was among those sitting¦74507 with Yeshua.
\v 3 \x + \xo 12:3: \xt Luk 7:37-38.\x*Then Maria¦74513 took about 300g of very expensive nard oil and smeared it on Yeshua's¦74528 feet, and then wiped¦74530 off his¦74536 feet with her¦74533 own hair¦74532, and the house¦74540 was filled¦74541 with the fragrance of the oil.
\v 4 But Yudas, one of Yeshua's apprentices¦74558 (the one who would eventually turn him in) complained,
\v 5 “How come this lotion wasn't sold for almost a year's wages and¦74582 then the money given¦74583 to the poor?”
\v 6 But he didn't say¦74586 this because he cared for poor people, but because he carried the purse for the group and used to steal from it.
\p
\v 7 But Yeshua¦74616 responded, “\wj Let her¦74618 continue. She has kept this for the time of my¦74625 burial¦74624.\wj*

\v 10 But the chief¦74682 priests¦74682 decided in a meeting that they¦74687 should also have Lazarus¦74686 killed,

\p
\v 16 (Yeshua's¦74798 apprentices didn't realise all these things at the time, but it was later after Yeshua was lifted up to heaven that they were reminded¦74800 that these things had been written¦74811 about him, and that they had \add indeed\add* happened to him.)
\p
\v 17 People in the crowd¦74819 were telling each other about how they'd been with Yeshua when he'd called¦74828 Lazarus¦74827 out from the burial chamber and brought him back to life,
\v 18 So because¦74848 of this, others also wanted to met Yeshua because they'd¦74849 heard¦74849 that he'd done that miracle.

\v 37 Even though Yeshua had done so many miracles in front of the people, they¦75284 didn't believe¦75284 that he was the messiah.
\v 38 \x + \xo 12:38: \xt Isa 53:1 (LXX).\x*This fulfilled¦75294 what the prophet¦75293 Isayah wrote,
\q1 “Master¦75297, who believed¦75299 our¦75302 report¦75301?
\q1 And who was the master's power revealed¦75308 to?”
\p
\v 39 Because¦75309 of this, they¦75312 weren't able to believe¦75314, and again¦75318 as Isayah¦75320 wrote,
\q1
\v 40 \x + \xo 12:40: \xt Isa 6:10 (LXX).\x*“He has blinded¦75321 their eyes and maimed¦75327 their emotions,
\q1 so that they can't see with their eyes and understand¦75339 with their minds,
\q2 or they might be turned¦75345 and then I would heal them.”
\p
\v 41 Isayah wrote this because¦75356 he saw¦75359 the¦75364 messiah's¦75364 greatness and spoke¦75366 concerning¦75367 him.
\v 42 Likewise¦75369, many of the Jewish leaders believed¦75377 that Yeshua was the messiah, but they didn't tell others because¦75381 they didn't want the Pharisee¦75383 party¦75383 to banish them from their services
\v 43 as they¦75391 valued the praise of people more than praise from God¦75403.

\p
\v 44 Then Yeshua¦75404 called out, “\wj Anyone who believes that I came from God is not \add just\add* believing in me, but \add also\add* believing in the one who sent me,\wj*
\v 45 \wj and¦75428 anyone who watches me \add working\add*, is watching the one who sent¦75435 me.\wj*
\v 46 \wj I came into this world¦75441 as light¦75438 so that anyone who believes¦75446 in me won't have darkness¦75451 residing in them.\wj*
\v 47 \wj I won't be judging¦75471 anyone¦75457 who hears my¦75458 teaching and¦75463 doesn't obey it, because¦75474 I didn't come to judge¦75477 the world but¦75480 rather to save¦75482 it.\wj*
\v 48 \wj Anyone who rejects¦75486 me and¦75488 doesn't accept my¦75493 teaching does have a judge though—it's the message¦75499 that I spoke¦75501 that will judge them at the end of time\wj*
\v 49 \wj because I wasn't speaking¦75532 from my own thoughts, but¦75517 it was the father¦75521 himself¦75522 who sent¦75519 me that told me what to say¦75529 and¦75530 what to teach.\wj*
\v 50 \wj And I'm fully aware that \add obeying\add* his¦75538 commands¦75537 leads to living forever. Therefore¦75545 whenever I speak, I just say whatever the father¦75553 said¦75550 to me.\wj*”

\p
\v 1 Even before¦75556 the actual feast part of the Passover celebrations, Yeshua¦75564 knew that his time had come—the time when he would leave this world and \add return\add* to the father¦75582. He loved his followers who were in the world right through to the end¦75592.
\p
\v 2 And now it was getting near time for the dinner and the devil¦75601 had already¦75602 put into Yudas Iscariot's mind¦75606 \add the idea\add* of handing Yeshua over \add to the authories\add*.
\v 3 Yeshua knew that the father¦75633 had given¦75629 everything to him, putting it under his control, and he knew that he had come from God and would return to God.
\v 4 So he got up from the dinner \add table\add*, changed out of his clothes¦75657, and wrapped a linen¦75661 towel¦75661 around himself¦75664.
\v 5 Then he put water¦75668 into the wash bowl and started washing¦75677 the feet¦75679 of his apprentices¦75681, wiping¦75684 them dry with the linen¦75686 towel¦75686 that was he was wearing wrapped around him.
\v 6 After he'd washed a few, he got to Simon¦75694 Peter who asked him, “Master¦75701, are you going to wash my¦75703 feet¦75706?”
\p
\v 7 “\wj What I'm doing¦75715 now,\wj*” Yeshua¦75708 answered¦75707, “\wj you won't really understand, but in the future you will.\wj*”
\p
\v 8 Peter responded, “Well I'm never ever going to let you wash \em my\em* feet¦75740!”
\p “\wj If I don't¦75734 wash them,\wj*” Yeshua¦75748 answered¦75745, “\wj then you won't be included in my \add group\add*.\wj*”
\p
\v 9 “Well, if that's so,” Peter said, “don't¦75765 just wash my feet¦75768 but¦75771 my hands¦75774 and¦75775 my head as well.”
\p
\v 10 Yeshua¦75781 responded, “\wj Any person who's already washed¦75783 \add themselves\add* only needs to wash their feet¦75795 now to be clean. And so you're clean, but not every one of you.\wj*”
\v 11 He said¦75819 this last bit because¦75817 he already knew who was going to hand him over.
\p
\v 12 \x + \xo 13:12-15: \xt Luk 22:27.\x*So when he'd finished washing their¦75830 feet¦75829, he got dressed again¦75841 and sat¦75840 down and asked, “\wj Do you know what I just did to you all?\wj*
\v 13 \wj You call me teacher and master¦75855, and so you¦75858 should, because¦75861 I am.\wj*

\p
\v 21 After saying¦76012 these¦75998 things¦75998, Yeshua¦76001 thoughts were troubled and he said, “\wj I can assure you that one of you will be turning me in.\wj*”
\p
\v 22 This made his apprentices¦76029 glance around at each other, puzzled about which one he was talking¦76035 about.
\v 23 One¦76049 of them that Yeshua¦76054 especially liked,\f + \fr 13:23 \ft This apprentice, unnamed here, is assumed to be the author of this account (being shy or modest).\f* was leaning against him¦76043 \add at the table\add*.
\v 24 So Simon¦76058 Peter nodded to him to find out who Yeshua had been talking¦76077 about¦76075,
\v 25 and he¦76086 leaned¦76080 back on Yeshua¦76089 and asked \add quietly\add*, “Master¦76092, who is it¦76094?”
\p
\v 26 “\wj It's the one I hand this piece of bread to after I've dipped it \add in the sauce\add*,\wj*” Yeshua¦76099 answered¦76095. Then after dipping his piece of bread in, he gave it to Yudas Iscariot.
\v 27 After accepting the piece¦76134 of bread¦76134, Satan¦76140 entered into Yudas, and then Yeshua¦76146 told him¦76144, “What you're¦76148 about to do, do it soon.”
\v 28 But none of the others sitting¦76158 around the table knew¦76155 what Yeshua meant.
\v 29 Some of them thought that since Yudas¦76175 held their purse, perhaps Yeshua¦76180 was getting him¦76178 to buy something they needed for the feast¦76189 or to give¦76195 something to the poor.
\p
\v 30 Anyway, having¦76197 eaten the piece¦76200 of bread¦76200, Yudas went straight outside where it¦76205 was already dark.

\v 1 After he'd said all this, Yeshua¦79058 and his followers went out of Yerusalem \add proper\add* and over the Kidron stream¦79067 towards a garden¦79074 that he and his followers entered.

\v 3 Meanwhile Yudas¦79108 had met with the soldiers and servants of the chief¦79115 priests¦79115 and the Pharisee¦79119 party¦79119, and they all started coming¦79121 into the garden with lanterns¦79124 and flaming torches¦79126 and weapons¦79128.
\v 4 Yeshua¦79129 who already knew what was going to happen to him¦79138, came forward and asked them, “\wj Who are you¦79146 all looking¦79146 for¦79146?\wj*”

\v 1 So Pilate¦79998 took¦79995 Yeshua¦80001 and¦80002 had him¦80003 flogged¦80003.
\v 2 Then the soldiers¦80006 twisted¦80007 some thorn¦80010 branches together¦80007 into a crown¦80008 and put it¦80012 on Yeshua's head, and they dressed him in a \add royal\add* purple¦80022 robe¦80021.
\v 3 They came up to him and said, “Greetings¦80031, you king¦80033 of the Jews¦80036,” and then slapped him.
\p
\v 4 Then Pilate¦80048 went back outside¦80046 and said to the Jews, “Look here. I'm bringing¦80054 him out to you so that you all can know¦80059 that I didn't find him guilty¦80067 of anything.”
\v 5 So they led Yeshua¦80078 out wearing¦80080 the thorny¦80083 crown¦80084 and the kingly robe¦80088, and Pilate said, “Look. Here's the man¦80095.”
\p
\v 6 Now when the chief¦80101 priests¦80101 and their supporters saw¦80098 him, they yelled¦80107 out, “Execute him on a stake! Execute him on a stake!”
\p “Well you take him and execute¦80122 him on a stake,” Pilate¦80116 answered, “because¦80124 I haven't found anything that he's guilty¦80130 of.”
\p
\v 7 The Jews¦80134 responded, “We have a law and he should be executed according¦80139 to that law because¦80145 he said he was the son of God¦80149.”
\p
\v 8 Now when Pilate¦80157 heard¦80155 that, he¦80163 became more afraid¦80163.
\v 9 So he went back inside the residence¦80168 and asked Yeshua, “Where do you come from?”
\p But Yeshua didn't answer¦80181 him.
\v 10 So Pilate¦80189 said, “Why don't¦80191 you answer me? Don't you realise that I have the authority to release you and I also have the authority to have you executed¦80204 on a stake¦80204?”
\p
\v 11 “\wj You have no authority¦80215 over me,\wj*” Yeshua¦80211 answered¦80208, “\wj none at all, except¦80220 what has been granted to you from above¦80226. Because¦80227 of this, the sin¦80235 of the person who handed me over to you is greater¦80234.\wj*”
\p
\v 12 After hearing this, Pilate¦80241 wanted to release him but the Jews¦80248 yelled¦80249 out, “If you release that man, you're¦80259 no friend of Caesar. Everyone¦80263 who claims to be a king is no friend of Caesar's.”
\p
\v 13 So now Pilate, having¦80276 heard¦80276 all this, brought¦80283 Yeshua¦80286 outside¦80284 \add again\add*. Pilate sat¦80289 down on the judge's seat at a place¦80294 called The Stone¦80296 Pavement¦80296 (and¦80288 called Gabbatha¦80301 in Hebrew).
\v 14 It was now about¦80311 noon on the day¦80305 when the Passover meal is prepared¦80305, and Pilate said to the Jews¦80319, “Look. Here's your¦80323 king¦80322.”
\p
\v 15 They yelled¦80327 back, “Take him away. Take him away. Execute¦80332 him on a stake.”
\p Pilate¦80337 asked them, “You want me to have your¦80340 king executed¦80341 on a stake?”
\p “We don't¦80345 have any king other than Caesar,” the chief priests¦80344 answered¦80342.
\p
\v 16 So Pilate gave¦80353 them his permission and handed Yeshua¦80367 over to them, and they took¦80361 him away to be executed¦80358 on a stake¦80358.

\v 17 Carrying the pole\f + \fr 19:17 \ft TD: The Greek word used here is used in other places to mean a stake such as used to make a fence. It's uncertain whether or not it had a horizontal cross-piece, although the Romans did use a range of methods.\f* himself¦80376, Yeshua arrived at the Place of the Skull (called Golgotha¦80392 in Hebrew) just out of the city
\v 18 where¦80393 they secured him to a stake along with two¦80400 others¦80399—one stake on each side and with Yeshua¦80408 on the middle¦80405 one.
\v 19 Pilate¦80414 wrote¦80409 out a title¦80412 and¦80415 put it¦80421 on the stake¦80420: Yeshua¦80424 from Nazareth¦80426, the king¦80428 of the Jews¦80430.
\v 20 Many Jews¦80440 read this title¦80435 because¦80441 the place¦80445 where¦80450 Yeshua¦80453 was executed¦80451 was near the city¦80447, and it¦80455 had been written¦80456 in Hebrew, Latin¦80459, and Greek.
\v 21 But the Jewish chief¦80467 priests¦80467 complained to Pilate¦80465, “Don't write ‘The king of the Jews’, but rather ‘The one who \em said\em* he was king of the Jews’.”
\p
\v 22 However Pilate¦80487 answered¦80485, “What I've written, I've written.”
\p
\v 23 After the soldiers¦80493 had fastened Yeshua¦80499 to the stake¦80496, they took¦80500 his clothes¦80502 and placed in four¦80506 piles, one for each of them. This left his robe, which had been woven¦80522 from top to bottom in one piece.
\v 24 So they said to each other, “Rather than tearing this, let's throw a dice to see who will get it.” (This fulfilled¦80543 what was written in the scriptures¦80542\x + \xo 19:24: \xt Psa 22:18.\x*that said: they divided¦80546 my garments among themselves¦80551 and threw¦80557 a dice for my clothes¦80549.) So they went ahead and did that.
\p
\v 25 Meanwhile a group of women had stayed standing near Yeshua¦80571 on the stake¦80569: his mother and his aunt, Maria the wife of Clopas¦80585, and Maria from Magdala¦80590.
\v 26 When Yeshua¦80591 saw his mother and also the intern that he loved standing nearby, he said to her, “\wj Look, he'll be your¦80613 son.\wj*”
\v 27 And to the intern he said, “\wj Look, she'll be your¦80622 mother¦80621.\wj*” And that intern took¦80629 her into his own \add home\add* from then on.

\p
\v 28 Having done this, Yeshua¦80642 knew that everything had been accomplished¦80648, and (in order¦80649 for the scriptures¦80653\x + \xo 19:28: \xt Psa 69:21; 22:15.\x*to be fulfilled¦80648) said, “\wj I'm thirsty¦80655.\wj*”
\p
\v 29 There was a container lying¦80659 there¦80666 full of vinegary wine, so they placed a sponge¦80665 on a hyssop¦80671 stalk¦80671, soaked it in the wine, and held it up to his mouth¦80676.
\v 30 After Yeshua¦80683 had sucked some wine out, he said¦80684, “\wj It is finished¦80685.\wj*” Then he bowed¦80687 his head and gave¦80690 up his spirit¦80693.

\v 31 Now because it was the preparation¦80698 day\x + \xo 19:31: \xt Jn 19:14.\x*for the coming Rest Day, the Jews¦80696 didn't want the bodies¦80707 to remain¦80702 on the stakes¦80705 after dusk (because it was even a special Rest Day.) So they asked¦80723 Pilate¦80726 to command for their legs to be broken¦80728 \add to hasten their deaths\add* and then they could be taken¦80733 down \add sooner\add*.
\v 32 So the soldiers¦80738 came¦80734 and broke¦80743 the legs of the men on each side of Yeshua,
\v 33 but when they got to him, they saw¦80758 that he was already¦80761 dead so they didn't break his¦80767 legs.
\v 34 Instead one of the soldiers¦80773 stabbed his¦80775 side with a spear¦80774 and immediately¦80783 blood¦80784 and water¦80786 came¦80782 out.

\p
\v 38 After all of this, Yosef from Arimathea¦80842 went to Pilate. (Yosef was a follower of Yeshua, but secretly because¦80850 he was afraid of what the Jewish leaders might do.) He asked¦80835 Pilate for permission¦80862 to remove Yeshua's¦80860 body, and it was granted to him so they went and got his body.
\v 39 \x + \xo 19:39: \xt Jn 3:1-2.\x*Nicodemus (the one who had first¦80890 visited Yeshua at night¦80888) also came¦80877, bringing¦80891 around 30kg of burial spices.
\v 40 So they took¦80902 Yeshua's¦80908 body¦80905 and wrapped it¦80911 around with linen¦80913 strips with the spices¦80917 as per the Jewish burial customs¦80919.
\v 41 There was a garden out at the place¦80929 where¦80930 Yeshua had been executed¦80931, and¦80933 in the garden there¦80925 was a new tomb¦80937 that hadn't been used yet.
\v 42 So because it was the preparation¦80951 day¦80951 and because the tomb¦80958 was nearby, they¦80960 laid his body in there¦80947.

\p
\v 1 The following Sunday, Maria¦80968 from Magdala¦80971 went out to the tomb very early¦80973 when it was still¦80975 dark, and she saw that the stone¦80984 had been removed from the entrance.
\v 2 So she ran quickly and went to Simon¦80998 Peter and the other¦81003 intern that Yeshua¦81008 loved, and told them, “They've taken the master's¦81014 body out of the tomb¦81017 and we don't¦81019 know where¦81021 they've put it.”
\p
\v 3 So Peter and the other¦81030 intern went out to the tomb¦81036.
\v 4 They were running¦81038 together¦81042, but the other¦81046 intern was a bit faster than Peter and so he got¦81054 to the tomb¦81059 first¦81055.
\v 5 Without going in, he stooped¦81062 down at the entrance and looked in and saw the linen¦81066 strips lying¦81064 there¦81064.
\v 6 But Peter came¦81082 along behind him¦81080 and went straight into the tomb¦81085 and also saw the linen¦81089 strips lying¦81090 there¦81090.
\v 7 But the piece of cloth¦81103 that had been on the head wasn't lying¦81104 there¦81104 with the linen¦81103 strips, but¦81105 had been folded and¦81091 placed¦81110 separately¦81106.
\v 8 So now the other¦81116 intern who had arrived first¦81120 also went inside and he saw¦81125 it all and believed¦81127 \add that Yeshua had risen\add*.

\p
\v 11 But Maria¦81148 had stayed there outside¦81158 the tomb weeping. But when she stooped¦81164 down and looked into the tomb,
\v 12 she saw two¦81170 messengers¦81171 dressed in white¦81174 sitting¦81175 there—one at the head end and one at the feet¦81184 end of the slab where¦81185 Yeshua's¦81190 body¦81188 had been lying¦81186.
\v 13 They spoke to her¦81193, “Woman¦81195, why are you¦81197 crying?”
\p “Because¦81203 they've taken away my¦81207 master¦81206,” she replied, “and¦81208 I don't¦81209 know where¦81211 they've put him¦81215.”
\p
\v 14 Then¦81234 she turned¦81219 back around and saw Yeshua¦81227 standing there, but she didn't realise who it was.
\v 15 Yeshua¦81240 asked her, “\wj Woman¦81241, why are you crying? Who are you looking¦81245 for¦81245?\wj*”
\p Maria assumed he might be the gardener¦81251, so she answered, “Mister¦81255, if you took the body, tell me where¦81266 you put it and I'll get it taken away \add for you\add*.”
\p
\v 16 Yeshua¦81278 just answered, “\wj Maria¦81280.\wj*”
\p She spun around and said, “My teacher!” (‘Rabboni¦81287’ in Hebrew.)
\p
\v 17 “\wj Don't touch¦81299 me,\wj*” Yeshua¦81296 said to her, “\wj because¦81302 I haven't gone back up to the father yet, but go and tell my brothers¦81313 that I'm going up to my father and the father of you all, and my god and the god of you all.\wj*”
\p
\v 18 So Maria¦81335 went and told the trainees, “I've seen¦81345 the master¦81348,” and she told them what he'd said¦81352.

\v 20 Then he showed¦81398 them his hands¦81402 and his side and they were so happy now that they had seen¦81413 the master¦81415.

\s1 The miracle of the net full of fish

\rem /s1 Jesus and the Miraculous Catch of Fish
\p
\v 1 After¦81706 all this, Yeshua¦81714 revealed himself again¦81712 to his trainees at Lake Galilee. It happened like this:
\v 2 Simon¦81729 Peter, Thomas nicknamed ‘Twin’, Nathanael¦81737 from Cana in Galilee¦81745, the sons¦81747 of Zebedee¦81751, and two¦81760 other¦81754 trainees had gathered together¦81728
\v 3 \x + \xo 21:3: \xt Luk 5:5.\x*when Simon¦81764 Peter said that he¦81783 was going¦81766 fishing¦81767 and the others said that they'd join him¦81769.
\p So they went off and got¦81780 in¦81780 the boat¦81784, but they didn't catch anything that night¦81790.
\p
\v 4 When¦81803 the dawn was approaching, Yeshua¦81815 was standing there on the shore¦81807, but they didn't know that it¦81816 was him.
\v 5 He¦81823 called out, “\wj Hey, young fellas. Don't you¦81828 have any fish¦81827?\wj*”
\p “None.” they answered¦81829.
\p
\v 6 \x + \xo 21:6: \xt Luk 5:6.\x*Then he said, “\wj Throw the net out over the right¦81840 side of the boat¦81843 and you'll find some.\wj*” So they did it and they caught so many fish that the net was too heavy to pull back in.
\p
\v 7 Now the intern that Yeshua¦81901 loved said to Peter, “It's the master!” When Simon¦81908 Peter heard¦81911 that, he put on his robe (because¦81920 he didn't have it on), and jumped overboard into the lake¦81928.
\v 8 The other¦81931 trainees followed in the little¦81935 boat¦81935 dragging¦81952 the net¦81954 behind them because¦81940 they¦81941 were only about¦81947 100m out from the shore.
\v 9 When they went up the beach, they saw some bread¦81971 there and a charcoal¦81965 fire¦81965 with fish¦81968 cooking on it¦81969
\v 10 and Yeshua¦81975 told them, “\wj Bring¦81976 some of the fish¦81980 that you¦81982 just caught¦81982.\wj*”
\p
\v 11 So Simon¦81987 Peter went and dragged¦81990 the net up onto the beach. Amazingly it hadn't torn even though it contained 153 large¦82003 fish.
\v 12 Then Yeshua¦82017 said, “\wj Now, come and have breakfast¦82019.\wj*” But none of the trainees dared to ask who he was, because they figured it must be the master¦82034.
\v 13 Yeshua¦82039 brought the bread¦82043 to them and shared it around, and then likewise¦82052 for the fish¦82051.
\p
\v 14 This was now the third¦82056 time¦82056 that Yeshua¦82059 had appeared to his trainees since he'd come back to life.

\v 15 While they were eating, Yeshua asked Simon Peter, “\wj Simon, son of Yohan¦82078, do you love me more than these¦82085?\wj*”
\p Peter answered, “Yes, master¦82089, you know that I love you.”
\p Yeshua responded, “\wj Feed my¦82103 lambs¦82102.\wj*”
\v 16 Then he¦82131 asked again¦82107, “\wj Simon¦82113, son of Yohan¦82114, do you love me?\wj*”
\p Peter replied, “Yes, master¦82121, you know that I love you.”
\p Yeshua responded, “\wj Shepherd my¦82134 sheep¦82132.\wj*”
\v 17 Then he asked a third time, “\wj Simon¦82139, son of Yohan¦82140, do you love me?\wj*”
\p Peter was now upset that he had been asked a third time if he loved him, and he answered, “Master¦82161, you know everything.”
\p “\wj Feed my¦82181 sheep¦82179,\wj*” Yeshua¦82176 responded.
\v 18 “\wj I can assure you that while you are young¦82189, you dress yourself¦82191 and go wherever you want to go, but as you age, you'll be stretching¦82199 out your¦82204 hands¦82202 and others will dress you and will take you where you don't¦82224 want to go.\wj*”
\v 19 When he said this, Yeshua was indicating how Peter would die honouring God¦82236, and he told Peter, “Keep following¦82242 me.”

\v 21 Noticing him, Peter asked Yeshua¦82288, “Master¦82289, what about¦82292 that one?”
\p
