\is2 Author
\ip This letter was written by Yudas the younger brother of Yacob. (Note that he wasn't the Yudas who handed Yeshua over to the Jewish religious leaders. Note also that Yudas is mistakenly called Yude in most English Bibles, and Yacob is quite wrongly called James in most English Bibles.)
\is2 This letter
\ip We don't know which group of believers that this letter was sent to. Here in this letter, Yudas warns the believers about teachers of false doctrines who teach that it's okay for believers to continue sinning since they'll just be forgiven due to God's mercy. That's the reason Yudas wrote this, to warn the believers so that they won't fall for false beliefs, but instead will continue to follow the true teaching that came from God. He also encourages the readers that it's necessary to strive to continue in their faith in God along with turning away from evil actions.

\v 1 \x + \xo 1: \xt Mat 13:55; Mrk 6:3.\x*\add This letter is from\add* Yudas, a slave¦155728 of Yeshua the messiah, and brother¦155729 of Yacob¦155731. It's written to all those who have been called¦155742 and loved¦155736 by \nd God¦155734\nd* the father¦155735 and who have kept¦155741 \add believing\add* in Yeshua the messiah.

\v 3 Friends, I was so enthusiastic to write to you concerning¦155758 our¦155761 salvation¦155762 that we have in common¦155760, but I needed to write to you all, encouraging you to stand strong for the teaching that was entrusted to the believers at a certain point in time.
\v 4 Because¦155782 some people¦155784 have quietly come into \add our groups\add* who think they can take advantage of God's grace¦155800 to bring in immoral lifestyles and disowning¦155817 the only master, and our master who is \nd Yeshua¦155814\nd* the \nd messiah¦155815\nd*. But they are destined for judgement.

\p
\v 5 \x + \xo 5: a \xt Exo 12:51; \xo b \xt Num 14:29-30.\x*Now I want to remind¦155819 you that although you all know how \nd Yeshua¦155835\nd* rescued our people¦155838 out of Egypt¦155841, yet \add at the same time\add* he destroyed¦155848 the ones who didn't believe¦155847.
\v 6 Even the messengers¦155849 who broke their own rules and left their own domain have been held in eternal¦155868 chains in the darkness¦155870 until the time of judgement in the great¦155865 day¦155866.
\v 7 \x + \xo 7: \xt Gen 19:1-24.\x*Similarly Sodom¦155873 and Gomorrah¦155875 and the towns around¦155878 them stay in our minds as an example¦155896 of the judgement of eternal¦155898 fire¦155897 due to similar¦155882 sexual perversions.
\p
\v 8 in the same way these¦155910 dreamers¦155911 defile¦155914 their own bodies while rejecting¦155918 the master¦155915 and dishonouring those who should be honoured.
\v 9 \x + \xo 9: a \xt Dan 10:13,21; 12:1; Rev 12:7; \xo b \xt Deu 34:6; \xo c \xt Zech 3:2.\x*Even Michael, \add one of\add* the top messengers, when he was arguing with the devil¦155933 about¦155936 Moses' body¦155939, he didn't belittle him, but left it to the \nd master¦155952\nd* to punish him.
\v 10 But these people mock what they don't¦155957 even grasp, but they'll be destroyed by what their animal¦155966 instincts do understand¦155967.
\v 11 \x + \xo 11: a \xt Gen 4:3-8; 1Jn 3:12; \xo b \xt Num 22–24; 31:16; 2Pe 2:15-16; \xo c \xt Num 16:1-35.\x*Oh dear! Because¦155974 they've followed the actions of Cain and have embraced the deception¦155982 of Balaam for monetary gain, so too they'll perish¦155993 like Korah's destruction.
\v 12 These¦155994 are the people who ruin your¦156008 love¦156006 feasts¦156006 when they eat without shame and only look after themselves¦156016. They're like clouds¦156018 that are blown away by the wind without bringing the needed rain or trees¦156027 that don't produce any fruit then are doubly useless by falling over;
\v 13 like wild waves¦156035 in the ocean that foam in their own shame¦156043 or like \add unreliable \add* wandering¦156045 stars¦156044 that are already doomed to the darkest darkness in the next age.
\p
\v 14 \x + \xo 14: \xt Gen 5:18,21-24.\x*Enoch (the seventh¦156062 generation from Adam¦156064) prophesied¦156058 \add way back then\add* about these¦156061 people, “Look, the \nd master¦156070\nd*, surrounded by tens of thousands¦156075 of his¦156079 holy \add messengers\add*, came¦156068
\v 15 to sentence everybody and to punish everyone who rejected God for everything they did that demonstrated this rejection and everything they said against him¦156111.”
\v 16 This includes their grumbling¦156116 and complaining¦156117, the fulfilling of their own lustful desires, the arrogant¦156131 way that they spoke, and their flattering of others in order to gain from them.

\v 17 But you¦156136, friends, always be thinking about how the missionaries of our¦156151 \nd master¦156150 Yeshua¦156152\nd* the \nd messiah¦156153\nd*
\v 18 \x + \xo 18: \xt 2Pe 3:3.\x*told you¦156156 that mockers¦156167 near the end of time¦156163 would come out following¦156174 their own god-rejecting lusts¦156172.
\v 19 These¦156177 people will cause division as they just demonstrate sensuality since they don't¦156184 know \add God's\add* \nd spirit¦156183\nd*.
\v 20 But you, friends, work to increase your¦156197 faith¦156198 in God, praying¦156205 as the holy \nd spirit¦156203\nd* helps you.
\v 21 Keep receiving God's love¦156210 as you look forward to living forever thanks to the mercy¦156216 of our¦156221 \nd master¦156218\nd*, \nd Yeshua¦156222\nd* the \nd messiah¦156223\nd*.
\p
\v 22 Show grace to those \add still\add* doubting¦156237
\v 23 whereas others¦156239 need to be ‘snatched¦156246 out of the fire¦156245’ in order to be saved. To some, show mercy¦156249 but very carefully, hating¦156253 even their clothes¦156261 which reflect their crude lifestyles.

\v 24-25 Our master, Yeshua the messiah, is the infallible¦156270 one who is quite capable of looking after all of us so that we can stand¦156275 blameless¦156283 in front¦156276 of him and praise him in his full honour and greatness. Let us honour and praise our only God and savior, acknowledging his greatness and power and authority through Yeshua from before the creation, right through these current times, and in the age to come. May it be so.
