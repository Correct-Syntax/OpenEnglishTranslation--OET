\v 1 \add +The_\add*revelation of_Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a) messiah, which gave to_him god, to_show to_the slaves of_him, what \add >things\add* it_is_fitting to_become in quickness, and he_signified \add it\add*, having_sent_out through the angel of_him to_the slave of_him, Yōannēs,
\v 2 who testified the word of_god, and the testimony of_Yēsous messiah, as_much_as he_saw.
\v 3 Blessed \add =is\add* the \add >one\add* reading and the \add >ones\add* hearing the words of_the prophecy, and keeping the \add >things\add* in it having_been_written, for the \add +the_\add*time \add =is\add* near.
\v 4 Seven Yōannēs to_the assemblies in Asia: grace to_you_all and peace, from the \add >one\add* being, and who was, and who coming, and from the seven spirits, who \add =are\add* before the throne of_him,
\v 5 and from Yēsous messiah, the witness faithful, the firstborn of_the dead, and the ruler of_the kings of_the earth. To_the \add >one\add* loving us, and having_released us from the sins of_us in the blood of_him,
\v 6 and made us \add +a_\add*kingdom, priests to_god and father of_him– to_him \add be\add* the glory and the dominion to the ages. Amen. 
\v 7 Behold, he_is_coming with the clouds, and will_be_seeing him every eye, and who him they_pierced, and will_be_mourning over him all the tribes of_the earth. Yes. Amen. 
\v 8 I am the first_letter and the last_letter, is_saying \add +the_\add*master, god: the \add >one\add* being, and who was, and who coming, the almighty.
\v 9 I Yōannēs, the brother of_you_all, and fellow-partaker in the tribulation, and kingdom, and endurance, in Yēsous, became in the island being_called Patmos, because_of the word of_god and the testimony of_Yēsous.
\v 10 I_became in \add +the_\add*spirit on the master's day, and I_heard behind me \add +a_\add*voice loud like of_\add +a_\add*trumpet
\v 11 saying: What you_are_seeing, write in \add +a_\add*scroll, and send to_the seven assemblies: to Efesos, and to Smurna, and to Pergamos, and to Thuateira, and to Sardeis, and to Filadelfeia, and to Laodikeia.
\v 12 And I_turned_back to_be_seeing the voice which was_speaking with me. And having_turned_back, I_saw seven lampstands golden,
\v 13 and in \add +the_\add*midst of_the lampstands: similar son of_man, having_dressed_in reaching_the_feet, and having_been_girded_about at the breasts \add +a_\add*belt golden.
\v 14 And the head of_him and his hairs \add were\add* white, as_though wool white as snow, and the eyes of_him like \add +a_\add*flame of_fire,
\v 15 and the feet of_him similar to_burnished_bronze as in \add +a_\add*furnace of_having_been_refined, and the voice of_him like \add +the_\add*voice of_waters many,
\v 16 and was_holding in the right hand of_him seven stars, and out_of the mouth of_him \add +a_\add*sword double_edged sharp going_out, and the face of_him like the sun is_shining in the power of_it.
\v 17 And when I_saw him, I_fell at the feet of_him, as_though dead. And he_put the right \add hand\add* of_him on me saying: Not be_fearing; I am the first and the last,
\v 18 and living and I_became dead, and behold, living I_am to the ages of_the ages, and I_am_having the keys of_death and of_Hadēs.
\v 19 Therefore write what \add >things\add* you_saw, and what \add >things\add* they_are, and what \add >things\add* is_going to_become after these \add >things\add*.
\v 20 The seven mystery of_the stars, which you_saw on the right \add hand\add* of_me, and the seven lampstands golden: the seven stars, seven \add +the_\add*angels of_the assemblies are, and the seven lampstands \add +the_\add*seven assemblies are.
\c 2
\v 1 To_the angel in Efesos assembly write: These \add >things\add* is_saying the \add >one\add* taking_hold_of the seven stars in the right \add hand\add* of_him, the \add >one\add* walking in \add +the_\add*midst of_the seven lampstands golden:
\v 2 I_have_known the works of_you, and the labor and endurance of_you, and that not you_are_being_able to_bear evil, and you_tested the \add >ones\add* saying themselves \add to_be\add* ambassadors, and not they_are, and you_found them false,
\v 3 and endurance you_are_having, and you_bore because_of the name of_me, and not you_all_having_wearied.
\v 4 But I_am_having against you that the love of_you first you_were_leaving.
\v 5 Therefore be_remembering from_where you_have_fallen and repent, and the first works do. And if not, I_am_coming to_you and will_be_removing the lampstand of_you out_of the place of_it, if not you_may_repent.
\v 6 But this you_are_having, that you_are_hating the works of_the Nicolaitans, which also_I am_hating.
\v 7 The \add >one\add* having \add +an_\add*ear, him_let_hear what the spirit is_saying to_the seven assemblies. To_the \add >one\add* overcoming, I_will_be_giving to_him to_eat of the tree of_life, which is in paradise of_god.
\v 8 And to_the angel of_the in Smurna assembly write: These \add >things\add* is_saying the first and the last, who became dead and lived:
\v 9 I_have_known of_you the tribulation and poverty (but rich you_are), and the slander of the \add >ones\add* saying of_\add +the_\add*Jews to_be themselves, and not they_are, but \add =are\add* \add +a_\add*synagogue of_Satan/(Sāţān).
\v 10 Not be_fearing what you_are_going to_be_suffering. Behold, is_going to_be_casting \add some\add* the devil of you_all into prison, in_order_that you_all_may_be_tested, and you_all_will_be_having tribulation ten for_days. Be_becoming faithful until death, and I_will_be_giving to_you the crown of_life.
\v 11 The \add >one\add* having \add +an_\add*ear, him_let_hear what the spirit is_saying to_the assemblies. The \add >one\add* overcoming by_no_means not may_be_injured by the death second.
\v 12 And to_the angel of_the in Pergamos assembly write: These \add >things\add* is_saying the \add >one\add* having the sword double_edged sharp:
\v 13 I_have_known where you_are_dwelling, where the throne of_Satan \add =is\add*, and you_are_taking_hold_of the name of_me, and not disowned the faith of_me, even in the days of_Antipas, the witness of_me faithful of_me, who was_killed_off among you_all, where Satan is_dwelling.
\v 14 But I_am_having against you \add +a_\add*few \add >things\add*, because you_are_having \add some\add* there taking_hold_of the teaching of_Bala'am/(Bbilə'ām), who was_teaching to_Balak to_cast \add +a_\add*temptation before the sons of_Israēl/(Yisərā'ēl), to_eat idol_sacrificed \add >things\add* and to_commit_sexual_immorality.
\v 15 Thus are_having \add some\add* also you, taking_hold_of the teaching of_\add +the_\add*Nicolaitans likewise.
\v 16 Therefore repent. And if not, I_am_coming to_you quickly, and I_will_be_warring with them with the sword of_the mouth of_me.
\v 17 The \add >one\add* having \add +an_\add*ear, him_let_hear what the spirit is_saying to_the assemblies. To_the \add >one\add* overcoming, I_will_be_giving to_him of_the manna having_been_hidden, and I_will_be_giving to_him \add +a_\add*stone white, and on the stone \add +a_\add*name new having_been_written, which no_one has_known, except the \add >one\add* receiving \add it\add*.
\v 18 And to_the angel of_the in Thuateira assembly write: These \add >things\add* is_saying the son of_god, the \add >one\add* having the eyes of_him like \add +a_\add*flame of_fire, and the feet of_him similar to_burnished_bronze:
\v 19 I_have_known of_you the works, and love, and faith, and service, and endurance of_you, and the works of_you, the last more \add =than\add* the first.
\v 20 But I_am_having against you that you_are_allowing the woman Jezebel, the \add woman\add* calling herself \add +a_\add*prophetess, and she_is_teaching and is_misleading my slaves to_commit_sexual_immorality, and to_eat idol_sacrificed \add food\add*.
\v 21 And I_gave to_her time, in_order_that she_may_repent, and not she_willed to_repent of the sexual_immorality of_her.
\v 22 behold, I_am_casting her into \add +a_\add*bed, and the \add >ones\add* committing_adultery with her into tribulation great, if not they_will_be_repenting of the works of_her.
\v 23 And the children of_her I_will_be_killing_off with death; and will_be_knowing all the assemblies that I am the \add >one\add* searching minds and hearts, and I_will_be_giving to_you_all to_each according_to the works of_you_all.
\v 24 But to_you_all I_am_saying to_the rest in Thuateira, as_many_as not are_having teaching this, who not they_knew the deep \add >things\add* of_Satan/(Sāţān), as they_are_saying, not I_am_casting on you_all another burden.
\v 25 However what you_all_are_having, take_hold_of until of_which I_may_come.
\v 26 And the \add >one\add* overcoming and keeping until \add +the_\add*end the works of_me: I_will_be_giving to_him authority over the nations…
\v 27 and he_will_be_shepherding them with \add +a_\add*rod iron, as the vessels pottery is_being_crushed,
\v 28 as also_I have_received from the father of_me, and I_will_be_giving to_him the star morning.
\v 29 The \add >one\add* having \add +an_\add*ear, him_let_hear what the spirit is_saying to_the assemblies.
\c 3
\v 1 And to_the angel of_the in Sardeis assembly write: These \add >things\add* is_saying the \add >one\add* having the seven spirits of_god and the seven stars: I_have_known of_you the works, that \add +the_\add*name you_are_having, that you_are_living, and_yet dead you_are.
\v 2 Be_becoming watching, and strengthen the other \add >things\add*, which were_going to_die_off, for not I_have_found of_you works, having_been_fulfilled before the god of_me.
\v 3 Therefore be_remembering how you_have_received and heard, and be_keeping \add it\add* and repent. Therefore if not you_may_watch, I_will_be_coming like \add +a_\add*thief, and by_no_means not you_may_know what hour I_will_be_coming on you.
\v 4 But you_are_having \add +a_\add*few names in Sardeis, who not soiled the clothes of_them, and they_will_be_walking with me in white \add garments\add*, because worthy they_are.
\v 5 The \add >one\add* overcoming, thus will_be_being_clothed in clothes white, and by_no_means not I_will_be_wiping_out the name of_him from the scroll of_life, and I_will_be_confessing the name of_him before the father of_me, and before the angels of_him.
\v 6 The \add >one\add* having \add +an_\add*ear, him_let_hear what the spirit is_saying to_the assemblies.
\v 7 And to_the angel of_the in Filadelfeia assembly write: These \add >things\add* is_saying the True \add One\add*, the holy \add >one\add*, having the key of_Dauid/(Ddāvid), the \add >one\add* opening_up and no_one will_be_shutting, and shutting and no_one is_opening_up:
\v 8 I_have_known of_you the works. Behold, I_have_given before you \add +a_\add*door having_been_opened_up, which no_one is_able to_shut it, because little you_are_having power, and_yet you_kept of_me the word, and not you_disowned the name of_me.
\v 9 Behold, I_may_be_giving \add those\add* of the synagogue of_Satan/(Sāţān), the \add >ones\add* saying themselves Jews to_be, and not they_are, but they_are_lying; behold, I_will_be_making them that they_will_be_coming and will_be_kneeling before the feet of_you, and they_may_know that I loved you.
\v 10 Because you_kept the word of_the endurance of_me, also_I you will_be_keeping out_of the hour of_the of_trial going to_be_coming on the inhabited_world whole, to_test the \add >ones\add* dwelling on the earth.
\v 11 I_am_coming quickly; be_taking_hold_of what you_are_having, in_order_that no_one may_take the crown of_you.
\v 12 The \add >one\add* overcoming, I_will_be_making him \add +a_\add*pillar in the temple of_the god of_me, and out by_no_means not he_may_come_out anymore, and I_will_be_writing on him the name of_the god of_me, and the name of_the city of_the god of_me, the new Hierousalēm/(Yərūshālam), the \add >one\add* coming_down out_of heaven from the god of_me, and the name of_me new.
\v 13 The \add >one\add* having \add +an_\add*ear, him_let_hear what the spirit is_saying to_the assemblies.
\v 14 And to_the angel of_the in Laodikeia assembly write: These \add >things\add* is_saying the amen, the witness faithful and true, the beginning of_the creation of_god:
\v 15 I_have_known of_you the works, that neither cool you_are nor hot. Profit cool you_were or hot.
\v 16 Thus, because lukewarm you_are, and neither hot nor cold, I_am_going you to_spit out_of the mouth of_me.
\v 17 Because you_are_saying, Rich I_am, and I_have_become_rich, and nothing need I_am_having, and not you_have_known that you are miserable, and pitiful, and poor, and blind, and naked.
\v 18 I_am_counselling to_you to_buy from me gold having_been_refined by fire, in_order_that you_may_be_rich, and clothes white, in_order_that you_may_clothe \add yourself\add*, and not may_be_revealed the shame of_the nakedness of_you, and eyesalve to_rub_in the eyes of_you, in_order_that you_may_be_seeing.
\v 19 I as_many_as may_be_loving, I_am_rebuking and I_am_disciplining; therefore be_being_zealous and repent.
\v 20 Behold, I_have_stood at the door and I_am_knocking; if anyone may_hear of_the voice of_me and may_open_up the door, I_will_be_coming_in to him, and I_will_be_dining with him, and he with me.
\v 21 The \add >one\add* overcoming, I_will_be_giving to_him to_sit_down with me on the throne of_me, as also_I overcame, and sat_down with the father of_me on the throne of_him.
\v 22 The \add >one\add* having \add +an_\add*ear, him_let_hear what the spirit is_saying to_the assemblies.
\c 4
\v 1 After these \add >things\add* I_looked, and behold, \add +a_\add*door having_been_opened_up in heaven, and the voice first that I_heard \add was\add* like \add +a_\add*trumpet speaking with me saying: Go_up here, and I_will_be_showing to_you what it_is_fitting to_become after these \add >things\add*.
\v 2 Immediately I_became in \add +the_\add*spirit, and behold, \add +a_\add*throne was_lying in heaven, and on the throne sitting,
\v 3 and the \add >one\add* sitting \add was\add* similar in_appearance to_\add +a_\add*stone, jasper and sardius, and priests around the throne \add was\add* similar in_appearance to_\add +an_\add*emerald.
\v 4 And around the throne \add were\add* twenty thrones four, and on thrones twenty four elders sitting, having_been_clothed in white, and on the heads of_them crowns golden.
\v 5 And out_of the throne are_going_out lightnings, and voices, and thunders. And seven lamps of_fire being_burned before the throne, which is the seven spirits of_god;
\v 6 and \add something\add* before the throne \add was\add* like \add +a_\add*sea glass, similar to_crystal. And in \add +the_\add*midst of_the throne and around the four, throne creatures \add were\add*, being_full of_eyes ahead and behind.
\v 7 And the creature first \add was\add* similar to_\add +a_\add*lion, and the second creature similar to_\add +a_\add*calf, and the third creature having the face as of_\add +a_\add*human, and the fourth creature similar to_\add +an_\add*eagle flying.
\v 8 And the four creatures, one by one of_them, having each six wings, around and inside they_are_being_full of_eyes, and rest not they_are_having day and night saying: holy, holy, holy, master god almighty, who was, and who being, and who coming.
\v 9 And whenever will_be_giving the creatures glory, and honor, and thanksgiving, to_the \add >one\add* sitting on the throne, the \add >one\add* living to the ages of_the ages,
\v 10 will_be_falling the twenty four elders before the \add >one\add* sitting on the throne, and they_will_be_worshipping before_the \add >one\add* living to the ages of_the ages, and they_will_be_casting the crowns of_them before the throne saying,
\v 11 Worthy you_are, the master and the god of_us, to_receive glory and honor and power, because you created the \add >things\add* all, and for the will of_you they_were, and they_were_created.
\c 5
\v 1 And I_saw on the right \add hand\add* of_the \add >one\add* sitting on the throne \add +a_\add*scroll, having_been_written inside and behind, having_been_sealed_up seven with_seals.
\v 2 And I_saw \add +an_\add*angel strong, proclaiming in in_\add +a_\add*voice loud: Who worthy to_open_up the scroll, and to_break the seals of_it. 
\v 3 And no_one was_able in heaven, and_not on the earth, nor beneath the earth, to_open_up the scroll, nor to_be_seeing it.
\v 4 And I_was_weeping much, because no_one worthy will_be_being_found to_open_up the scroll, nor to_be_looking it.
\v 5 And one of the elders is_saying to_me: Not be_weeping. Behold, overcame the lion of the tribe of_Youda/(Yəhūdāh), the root of_Dauid/(Ddāvid), to_open_up the scroll, and the seven seals of_it.
\v 6 And I_saw in \add +the_\add*midst of_the throne and of_the four creatures and in \add +the_\add*midst of_the elders, \add +a_\add*lamb having_stood as having_been_slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of_god, having_been_sent_out into all the earth.
\v 7 And he_came and has_taken \add it\add* out_of the right \add hand\add* of_the \add >one\add* sitting on the throne.
\v 8 And when he_took the four, scroll the creatures and the twenty four elders fell before the lamb, having each \add +a_\add*harp and bowls golden being_full of_incenses, which are the prayers of_the holy \add >ones\add*.
\v 9 And they_are_singing \add +a_\add*song new saying: Worthy you_are to_take the scroll, and to_open_up the seals of_it, because you_were_slain, and bought to_god us by the blood of_you, out_of every tribe, and tongue, and people, and nation,
\v 10 and you_made them to_the god of_us, \add +a_\add*kingdom and priests, and they_will_be_reigning on the earth.
\v 11 And I_looked, and I_heard \add +the_\add*voice of_angels many around the throne, and of_the creatures, and of_the elders, and was the number of_them myriads of_myriads and thousands of_thousands,
\v 12 saying with_\add +a_\add*voice loud: Worthy is the lamb having_been_slain, to_receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honor, and glory, and blessing. 
\v 13 And every creature which in heaven, and on the earth, and beneath the earth, and on the sea, and the \add >things\add* in them all, I_heard saying: To_the \add >one\add* sitting on the throne and to_the lamb \add be\add* blessing, and honor, and glory, and dominion, to the ages of_the ages.
\v 14 And the four creatures were_saying: Amen. And the elders fell and worshipped.
\c 6
\v 1 And I_saw, when opened_up the lamb one of of_the seven seals, and I_heard from_one of the four creatures, saying as with_\add +a_\add*voice of_thunder: Be_coming. 
\v 2 And I_looked, and behold, \add +a_\add*horse white, and the \add >one\add* sitting on it having \add +a_\add*bow, and was_given to_him \add +a_\add*crown, and he_came_out conquering, and that he_may_conquer.
\v 3 And when he_opened_up the seal second, I_heard from_the second creature saying: Be_coming. 
\v 4 And came_out another horse red, and to_the \add >one\add* sitting on it, was_given to_him to_take the peace from the earth, and in_order_that one_another they_will_be_slaying, and was_given to_him \add +a_\add*sword great.
\v 5 And when he_opened_up the seal third, I_heard from_the third creature saying: Be_coming. And I_looked, and behold, \add +a_\add*horse black, and the \add >one\add* sitting on it, having \add +a_\add*scale in the hand of_him.
\v 6 And I_heard \add something\add* like \add +a_\add*voice in \add +the_\add*midst of_the four creatures saying: \add +A_\add*choenix of_wheat three, for_\add +a_\add*denarius and choenix of_barley for_\add +a_\add*denarius, but the olive_oil and the wine not you_may_injure.
\v 7 And when he_opened_up the seal fourth, I_heard \add +the_\add*voice of_the fourth creature saying: Be_coming. 
\v 8 And I_looked, and behold, \add +a_\add*horse green, and the \add >one\add* sitting on it, \add +the_\add*name to_him \add was\add* Death, and Hadēs was_following with him, and was_given to_them authority over the fourth of_the earth, to_kill_off with sword, and with famine, and with death, and by the wild_beasts of_the earth.
\v 9 And when he_opened_up the fifth seal, I_saw beneath the altar, the souls having_been_slain because_of the word of_god, and because_of their testimony which they_were_having.
\v 10 And they_cried_out with_\add +a_\add*voice loud saying: Until when the master holy and true, not you_are_judging and are_avenging the blood of_us, from the \add >ones\add* dwelling on the earth. 
\v 11 And was_given to_them each \add +a_\add*robe white, and it_was_said to_them that they_may_rest \add +a_\add*time still little, until may_be_fulfilled also the fellow-slaves of_them, and the brothers of_them, the \add >ones\add* going to_be_being_killed_off as also they.
\v 12 And I_saw when he_opened_up the seal sixth, and \add +an_\add*earthquake great there_became, and the sun became black as sackcloth hairy, and the moon whole became like blood,
\v 13 and the stars of_the sky fell to the earth, as \add +a_\add*fig_tree is_casting the unripe_figs of_it, by \add +a_\add*wind great being_shaken.
\v 14 And heaven was_separating like \add +a_\add*scroll being_rolled_up, and every mountain and island out_of the places of_them moved.
\v 15 And the kings of_the earth, and the magnates, and the commanders, and the rich, and the mighty, and every slave and free \add man\add*, hid themselves in the caves and among the rocks of_the mountains,
\v 16 and they_are_saying to_the mountains and to_the rocks: Fall on us, and hide us from \add +the_\add*face of_the \add >one\add* sitting on the throne, and from the severe_anger of_the lamb,
\v 17 because came the day great of_the severe_anger of_them, and who is_able to_be_stood. 
\c 7
\v 1 After this I_saw four angels having_stood on the four corners of_the earth, taking_hold_of the four winds of_the earth, in_order_that neither may_be_blowing \add +the_\add*wind on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree.
\v 2 And I_saw another angel, going_up from \add +the_\add*rising of_\add +the_\add*sun, having \add +the_\add*seal of_god \add +the_\add*living, and he_cried_out with_\add +a_\add*voice loud to_the four angels to_whom was_given to_them to_injure the earth and the sea
\v 3 saying: Not you_all_may_injure the earth, neither the sea nor the trees, until we_may_seal the slaves of_the god of_us on the foreheads of_them.
\v 4 And they_heard the number of_the \add >ones\add* having_been_sealed, hundred forty four thousands, having_been_sealed out_of every tribe of_\add +the_\add*sons of_Israēl/(Yisərā'ēl):
\v 5 out_of \add +the_\add*tribe Twelve of_Youda/(Yəhūdāh) thousands having_been_sealed, out_of \add +the_\add*tribe Twelve of_Reuben thousands, out_of \add +the_\add*tribe Twelve of_Gad thousands,
\v 6 out_of \add +the_\add*tribe Twelve of_Aser thousands, out_of \add +the_\add*tribe Twelve of_Nefthaleim/(Nafəttālī) thousands, out_of \add +the_\add*tribe Twelve of_manasseh thousands,
\v 7 out_of \add +the_\add*tribe Twelve of_Sumeōn/(Shimə'ōn) thousands, out_of \add +the_\add*tribe Twelve of_Leui/(Lēvī) thousands, out_of \add +the_\add*tribe Twelve of_Issachar thousands,
\v 8 out_of \add +the_\add*tribe Twelve of_Zaboulōn/(Zəvūlūn) thousands, out_of \add +the_\add*tribe Twelve of_Benjamin thousands, out_of \add +the_\add*tribe of_Yōsēf/(Yōşēf) Twelve thousands having_been_sealed.
\v 9 After these \add >things\add* I_looked, and behold, crowd great, which to_number it no_one was_able, out_of every nation, and tribes, and peoples, and tongues, having_stood before the throne and before the lamb, having_been_clothed in_robes white, and palm_branches in the hands of_them;
\v 10 and they_are_crying_out with_\add +a_\add*voice loud saying: salvation to_the god of_us, to_the \add >one\add* sitting on the throne and to_the lamb. 
\v 11 And all the angels had_stood around the throne, and the elders, and the four creatures, and they_fell before the throne on the faces of_them, and they_worshipped before_god
\v 12 saying: Amen. blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honor, and power, and strength \add be\add*, to_the god of_us to the ages of_the ages. Amen. 
\v 13 And answered one of of_the elders, saying to_me: These, having_been_clothed in_the robes white, who_all they_are and from_where they_came. 
\v 14 And I_have_said to_him: master of_me, you you_have_known. And he_said to_me: These are the \add >ones\add* coming out_of the tribulation great, and they_washed the robes of_them, and they_whitened them in the blood of_the lamb.
\v 15 Because_of this, they_are before the throne of_god, and they_are_serving unto_him day and night in the temple of_him, and the \add >one\add* sitting on the throne will_be_sheltering over them.
\v 16 Neither they_will_be_hungering anymore, nor they_will_be_thirsting anymore, nor not may_fall on them the sun, nor any burning,
\v 17 because the lamb who \add =is\add* among \add +the_\add*middle of_the throne will_be_shepherding them, and will_be_guiding them to of_life springs of_waters, and will_be_wiping_out god every tear from the eyes of_them.
\c 8
\v 1 And whenever he_opened_up the seal seventh, became silence in heaven for_about \add +an_\add*half_hour.
\v 2 And I_saw the seven angels, who before god have_stood, and they_were_given to_them seven trumpets.
\v 3 And another angel came and was_stood at the altar, having \add +a_\add*censer golden, and was_given to_him incenses much, in_order_that he_will_be_giving \add it\add* with_the prayers of_the holy \add >ones\add* all on the altar golden before the throne.
\v 4 And went_up the smoke of_the incenses with_the prayers of_the holy \add >ones\add* out_of \add +the_\add*hand of_the angel before god.
\v 5 And has_taken the angel the censer, and filled it from the fire of_the altar, and he_cast \add it\add* on the earth; and there_became thunders, and sounds, and lightnings, and \add +an_\add*earthquake.
\v 6 And the seven angels having the seven trumpets prepared themselves, in_order_that they_may_trumpet.
\v 7 And the first trumpeted, and there_became hail and fire having_been_mixed with blood, and it_was_cast on the earth; and the third of_the \add +the_\add*earth was_burned_up, and the third of_the trees was_burned_up, and all grass green was_burned_up.
\v 8 And the second angel trumpeted, and \add something\add* like \add +a_\add*mountain great with_fire being_burned, was_cast into the sea; and became the third of_the sea blood,
\v 9 and died_off the third of_the creatures in the sea having life, and the third of_the ships were_ruined.
\v 10 And the third angel trumpeted, and fell out_of the sky \add +a_\add*star great, being_burned like \add +a_\add*torch, and fell on the third of_the rivers, and on the springs of_the waters,
\v 11 and the name of_the star is_being_called Wormwood. And became the third of_the waters into wormwood, and many of_the people died_off from the waters, because they_were_made_bitter.
\v 12 And the fourth angel trumpeted, and was_struck the third of_the sun, and the third of_the moon, and the third of_the stars, in_order_that may_be_darkened the third of_them, and the day not may_appear for_the third of_it, and the night likewise.
\v 13 And I_looked, and I_heard from_one eagle flying in midair, saying with_\add +a_\add*voice loud: Woe, woe, woe, to_the \add >ones\add* dwelling on the earth, for the other voices of_the three trumpet of_the angels going to_be_trumpeting. 
\c 9
\v 1 And the fifth angel trumpeted, and I_saw \add +a_\add*star out_of the sky having_fallen to the earth, and was_given to_him the key of_the pit of_the abyss,
\v 2 and he_opened_up the pit of_the abyss, and went_up smoke out_of of_the pit, like \add +the_\add*smoke of_\add +a_\add*furnace great, and was_darkened the sun and the air by the smoke of_the pit.
\v 3 And out_of the smoke came_out locusts to the earth, and was_given to_them power, like are_having power the scorpions of_the earth.
\v 4 And it_was_said to_them that neither they_may_injure the grass of_the earth, nor any green \add >thing\add*, nor any tree, except the people who not are_having the seal of_god on their foreheads.
\v 5 And it_was_given to_them, in_order_that not they_may_kill_off them, but in_order_that they_will_be_being_tormented five for_months; and the torment of_them \add =is\add* like torment of_\add +a_\add*scorpion, whenever it_may_fall \add on\add* \add +a_\add*person.
\v 6 And in days those, will_be_seeking people death, and by_no_means not they_will_be_finding it, and they_will_be_desiring to_die_off, but is_fleeing death from them.
\v 7 And the likenesses of_the locusts \add was\add* likenesses to_horses having_been_prepared for war, and \add something\add* on the heads of_them \add were\add* like crowns similar to_gold, and the faces of_them like \add +the_\add*faces of_humans,
\v 8 and they_were_having hairs like \add +the_\add*hairs of_women, and the teeth of_them like of_lions were,
\v 9 and they_were_having breastplates like breastplates iron, and the sound of_the wings of_them as \add +the_\add*sound of_chariots of_horses many running into war,
\v 10 and they_are_having tails to_similar to_scorpions and stings, and in the tails of_them \add =is\add* the power of_them to_injure people five for_months.
\v 11 They_are_having over themselves \add +a_\add*king, the angel of_the abyss; \add +the_\add*name to_him In_Hebrew \add =is\add*, Abaddon, and in Hellēn he_is_having, \add +the_\add*name Apollyon.
\v 12 woe the first went_away; behold, is_coming still two woes after these \add >things\add*.
\v 13 And the sixth angel trumpeted, and I_heard one voice from the horns of_the altar golden before god,
\v 14 saying to_the sixth angel, having the trumpet: Release the four angels, having_been_bound at the river great Eufratēs.
\v 15 And were_loosed the four angels, having_been_prepared for the hour, and day, and month, and year, in_order_that they_may_kill_off the third of_mankind.
\v 16 And the number of_the armies of_the horsemen \add were\add* two ten_thousand of_ten_thousand; I_heard the number of_them.
\v 17 And thus I_saw the horses in my vision, and the \add >ones\add* sitting on them: having breastplates fiery, and hyacinthine, and sulfurous, and the heads of_the horses like \add +the_\add*heads of_lions, and out_of the mouths of_them is_going_out fire, and smoke, and sulfur.
\v 18 By three plagues these were_killed_off the third of_mankind by the fire, and the smoke, and the sulfur, going_out out_of the mouths of_them.
\v 19 For the power of_the horses in the mouth of_them is and in the tails of_them, for the tails of_them \add =are\add* similar to_serpents, having heads, and with them they_are_injuring.
\v 20 And the rest of_the people, who not were_killed_off by plagues these, not_even they_repented of the works of_the hands of_them, in_order_that not they_will_be_worshipping the demons, and the idols golden, and silver, and bronze, and stone, and wooden, which neither to_be_seeing are_being_able, nor to_be_hearing, nor to_be_walking.
\v 21 And neither they_repented of the murders of_them, nor of the sorceries of_them, nor of the wickedness of_them, nor of the \add +the_\add*thefts of_them.
\c 10
\v 1 And I_saw another angel mighty, coming_down out_of heaven, having_been_clothed in_\add +a_\add*cloud, and the rainbow on the head of_him, and the face of_him like the sun, and the feet of_him like pillars of_fire,
\v 2 and having in the hand of_him \add +a_\add*little_scroll having_been_opened_up. And he_put the foot of_him right on the sea, and his \add +the_\add*left on the earth,
\v 3 and he_cried_out with_\add +a_\add*voice loud as \add +a_\add*lion is_roaring. And when he_cried_out, spoke the seven thunders the of_themselves voices.
\v 4 And when spoke the seven thunders, I_was_going to_be_writing, but I_heard \add +a_\add*voice out_of heaven saying: Seal what \add >things\add* spoke the seven thunders, and not them you_may_write.
\v 5 And the angel, whom I_saw having_stood on the sea and on the land, lifted_up the hand of_him right to heaven,
\v 6 and swore to to_the \add >one\add* living to the ages of_the ages: who created heaven and the \add >things\add* in it, and the earth and the \add >things\add* in it, and the sea and the \add >things\add* in it, that time no_longer will_be. 
\v 7 But in the days of_the voice of_the angel, seventh whenever he_may_be_going to_be_trumpeting, also was_finished the mystery of_god, as he_gospel_preached to_the of_himself slaves, and the prophets.
\v 8 And the voice that I_heard out_of heaven, again \add was\add* speaking with me, and saying: Be_going, take the scroll having_been_opened_up in the hand of_the angel, having_stood on the sea and on the land.
\v 9 And I_went_away to the angel, telling to_him to_give to_me the little_scroll. And he_is_saying to_me: Take and devour it, and it_will_be_making_bitter of_you the stomach, but in the mouth of_you, it_will_be sweet as honey.
\v 10 And I_took the little_scroll out_of the hand of_the angel, and I_devoured it, and it_was in the mouth of_me as honey sweet; and when I_ate it, was_filled the stomach of_me.
\v 11 And they_are_saying to_me: It_is_fitting you again to_prophesy concerning peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings many.
\c 11
\v 1 And was_given to_me \add +a_\add*rod similar to_\add +a_\add*staff saying: Be_raising, and measure the temple of_god, and the altar, and the \add >ones\add* worshipping in it.
\v 2 And the courtyard outside the temple, cast_out outside and not it you_may_measure, because it_was_given also to_the nations, and the city holy they_will_be_treading forty for_months two.
\v 3 And I_will_be_giving to_the two witnesses of_me, and they_will_be_prophesying for_days two_hundred \add +a_\add*thousand sixty, having_been_clothed in_sackcloth.
\v 4 These are the two olive_trees and the two lampstands, before the master of_the earth having_stood.
\v 5 And if anyone them is_wanting to_injure, fire is_going_out of the mouth of_them, and is_devouring the enemies of_them. And if anyone may_want them to_injure, thus because_of him to_be_killed_off.
\v 6 These are_having the power to_shut the sky, in_order_that no rain may_be_raining in_the days of_the prophecy of_them, and power they_are_having over the waters, to_be_turning them into blood, and to_strike the earth with every plague, as_often_as they_may_want.
\v 7 And whenever they_may_finish the testimony of_them, the wild_beast going_up out_of the abyss will_be_making with them war, and will_be_overcoming them, and will_be_killing_off them.
\v 8 And the corpse of_them \add will_be\add* on the road of_the city great, which is_being_called spiritually, Sodoma/(Şədom) and Aiguptos/(Miʦərayim), where also the master of_them was_crucified.
\v 9 And they_are_looking of the peoples, and tribes, and tongues, and nations, the corpse of_them three for_days and \add +a_\add*half, and the corpses of_them not they_are_allowing to_be_put into \add +a_\add*tomb.
\v 10 And the \add >ones\add* dwelling on the earth are_rejoicing over them, and are_being_gladdened, and gifts they_will_be_sending to_one_another, because these prophets two tormented the \add >ones\add* dwelling on the earth.
\v 11 And after the three days and \add +a_\add*half, \add +the_\add*spirit of_life from god came_in into them, and they_stood on the feet of_them, and fear great fell_on on the \add >ones\add* observing them.
\v 12 And they_heard \add +a_\add*voice great out_of heaven, saying to_them: Go_up here. And they_went_up to the sky in the cloud, and observed them the enemies of_them.
\v 13 And in that hour became \add +an_\add*earthquake great, and the tenth of_the city fell, and were_killed_off in the earthquake, \add +the_\add*names of_people seven thousands, and the rest frightened became, and they_gave glory to_the god of_heaven.
\v 14 The woe second went_away; behold, is_coming the woe third quickly.
\v 15 And the seventh angel trumpeted, and became voices great in heaven saying: Became the kingdom of_the world of_the master of_us and of_the messiah of_him, and he_will_be_reigning to the ages of_the ages.
\v 16 And the twenty four elders before of_god were_sitting on the thrones of_them, fell on the faces of_them, and they_worshipped before_god
\v 17 saying: We_are_giving_thanks to_you, master, god almighty, who being, and who was, and because you_have_taken the power of_you great, and you_reigned.
\v 18 And the nations were_angered, and came the severe_anger of_you, and the time for_the dead to_be_judged, and to_give the reward to_the slaves of_you, the prophets, and to_the holy \add >ones\add*, and to_the \add >ones\add* fearing the name of_you, the small and the great, and to_ruin the \add >ones\add* ruining the earth.
\v 19 And was_opened_up the temple of_god in heaven, and was_seen the ark of_the covenant of_him in the temple of_him, and there_became lightnings, and voices, and thunders, and \add +an_\add*earthquake, and hail great.
\c 12
\v 1 And \add +a_\add*sign great was_seen in heaven: \add +a_\add*woman having_been_clothed with_the sun, and the moon \add was\add* beneath the feet of_her, and on the head of_her \add +a_\add*crown twelve of_stars,
\v 2 and in womb having \add child\add*, and she_is_crying_out laboring_in_birth, and being_tormented to_bear.
\v 3 And was_seen another sign in heaven: and behold, \add +a_\add*dragon red great having seven heads, and ten horns, and on the heads of_him seven crowns,
\v 4 and the tail of_him is_dragging the third of_the stars of_the sky, and he_cast them to the earth. And the dragon was_standing before the woman going to_bear, in_order_that whenever she_may_bear, the child of_her he_may_devour \add it\add*.
\v 5 And she_bore \add +a_\add*son \add +a_\add*male, who is_going to_be_shepherding all the nations with \add +a_\add*rod iron; and was_snatched the child of_her to god, and to the throne of_him.
\v 6 And the woman fled into the desert, where she_is_having there \add +a_\add*place having_been_prepared by god, in_order_that there they_may_be_nourishing her for_days two_hundred thousand sixty.
\v 7 And became war in heaven, Miⱪaēl/(Mīkā'ēl) and the angels of_him to_war with the dragon. And the dragon warred and the angels of_him,
\v 8 and not prevailed, nor \add +a_\add*place was_found for_them anymore in heaven.
\v 9 And was_cast \add down\add* the dragon the serpent great ancient, who being_called, \add +the_\add*Devil, and Satan/(Sāţān), the \add >one\add* deceiving the inhabited_world whole; he_was_cast \add down\add* on the earth, and the angels of_him with him were_cast \add down\add*.
\v 10 And I_heard \add +a_\add*voice great in heaven saying: Now became the salvation, and the power, and the kingdom of_god of_us, and the authority of_the messiah of_him, because was_cast \add down\add* the accuser of_the brothers of_us, the \add >one\add* accusing them before the god of_us, day and night.
\v 11 And they overcame him because_of the blood of_the lamb, and because_of the word of_the testimony of_them, and not they_loved the life of_them until death.
\v 12 Because_of this be_being_gladdened, heavens, and you_all in them sheltering. woe the earth and the sea, because came_down the devil to you_all, having rage great, having_known that \add +a_\add*little time he_is_having.
\v 13 And when saw the dragon that he_was_cast on the earth, he_persecuted the woman, who bore the male \add child\add*.
\v 14 And were_given to_the two woman wings of_the eagle great, in_order_that she_may_be_flying into the desert into the place of_her, where she_is_being_nourished there \add +a_\add*time, and times, and \add +a_\add*half of_\add +a_\add*time, from \add +the_\add*face of_the serpent.
\v 15 And cast the serpent out_of the mouth of_him after the woman, water as \add +a_\add*river, in_order_that her \add +a_\add*flood may_make.
\v 16 And gave_help the earth to_the women, and opened_up the earth the mouth of_it, and swallowed_up the river, which cast the dragon out_of the mouth of_him.
\v 17 And was_angered the dragon with the women, and went_away to_make war with the rest of_the children of_her, keeping the commandments of_god, and holding the testimony of_Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a).
\v 18 And he_was_stood on the sand of_the sea.
\c 13
\v 1 And I_saw out_of the sea \add +a_\add*wild_beast going_up, having ten horns and seven heads, and on the horns of_it ten crowns, and on the heads of_it \add +a_\add*name of_slander.
\v 2 And the wild_beast that I_saw was similar to_\add +a_\add*leopard, and the feet of_it like of_\add +a_\add*bear, and the mouth of_it like \add +the_\add*mouth of_\add +a_\add*lion. And gave to_it the dragon the power of_him, and the throne of_him, and authority great.
\v 3 And one of the heads of_it as having_been_slain to death, and the wound of_the death of_it was_healed. And was_being_marvelled all the earth after the wild_beast,
\v 4 and they_worshipped before_the dragon, because he_gave his authority to_the wild_beast, and they_worshipped before_the wild_beast saying: Who \add =is\add* similar to_the wild_beast, and who is_able to_war with it. 
\v 5 And was_given to_it \add +a_\add*mouth speaking great \add >things\add* and slander, and was_given to_it authority to_work forty for_months two.
\v 6 And it_opened_up the mouth of_it to slander against god, to_slander the name of_him, and the tabernacle of_him, the \add >ones\add* in heaven sheltering.
\v 7 And was_given to_it authority over every tribe, and people, and tongue, and nation.
\v 8 And will_be_worshipping it all the \add >ones\add* dwelling on the earth, whom has_been_written the name of_him in scroll of_life of_the lamb, having_been_slain from \add +the_\add*foundation of_\add +the_\add*earth.
\v 9 If anyone is_having \add +an_\add*ear, him_let_hear.
\v 10 If anyone \add is_going\add* into captivity, he_is_going; if anyone with \add +the_\add*sword is_killing_off, it_is_fitting him by \add +the_\add*sword to_be_killed_off. Here is the endurance and the \add +the_\add*faith of_the holy \add >ones\add*.
\v 11 And I_saw another wild_beast going_up out_of the earth, and it_was_having two horns similar to_\add +a_\add*lamb, and it_was_speaking like \add +a_\add*dragon.
\v 12 And the authority of_the first wild_beast all it_is_doing before it. And it_is_making the earth and the \add >ones\add* in it dwelling, in_order_that they_will_be_worshipping the wild_beast first, of_whom was_healed the wound of_death of_it.
\v 13 And it_is_performing signs great, that even fire it_may_be_making out_of the sky to_be_coming_down to the earth before the people.
\v 14 And it_is_deceiving dwelling on the earth, because_of the signs that it_was_given to_it to_perform before the wild_beast, telling to_the \add >ones\add* dwelling on the earth, to_make \add +an_\add*image to_the wild_beast, who is_having the wound of_the sword, and lived.
\v 15 And it_was_given to_it to_give spirit to_the image of_the wild_beast, in_order_that also may_speak the image of_the wild_beast, and may_make as_many_as not will_be_worshipping before_the image of_the wild_beast they_may_be_killed_off.
\v 16 And it_is_making all, the small and the great, and the rich and the poor, and the free and the slaves, that they_may_give to_them \add +a_\add*mark on the hand of_them right, or on the forehead of_them,
\v 17 and that not someone may_be_able to_buy or to_sell, except the \add >one\add* having the mark, the name of_the wild_beast, or the number of_the name of_it.
\v 18 Here wisdom is: the \add >one\add* having \add +a_\add*mind let_count the number of_the wild_beast, for \add +the_\add*number of_\add +a_\add*man it_is, and the number of_it is six_hundred ten six.
\c 14
\v 1 And I_looked, and behold, the lamb having_stood on the Mount of_Siōn/(Tsiuōn), and with him \add +a_\add*hundred forty four thousands having the name of_him, and the name of_the father of_him, having_been_written on the foreheads of_them.
\v 2 And I_heard \add +a_\add*sound out_of heaven, as \add +the_\add*sound of_waters many, and as \add +the_\add*sound of_thunder loud, and the sound that I_heard \add was\add* like of_harpists playing_the_harp with the harps of_them.
\v 3 And they_are_singing \add +a_\add*song new before the throne, and before the four creatures, and the elders. And no_one was_able to_learn the song, except the hundred forty four thousands, having_been_bought from the earth.
\v 4 These are \add those\add* who with women not were_defiled, for virgins they_are. These \add =are\add* the \add >ones\add* following after_the lamb wherever he_is_going_away. These were_bought from mankind as_first-fruit to_god and to_the lamb,
\v 5 and in the mouth of_them not was_found \add +a_\add*falsehood, for blameless they_are.
\v 6 And I_saw another angel flying in midair, having \add +the_\add*gospel eternal to_gospel_preach to the \add >ones\add* dwelling on the earth, and on every nation, and tribe, and tongue, and people,
\v 7 saying with \add +a_\add*voice loud: Be_revering the god, and give to_him glory, because came the hour of_the judgment of_him, and worship before_the \add >one\add* having_made heaven, and the earth, and \add +the_\add*sea, and \add +the_\add*springs of_waters.
\v 8 And \add +an_\add*other second angel followed saying: Fell, fell Babulōn/(Bbāvel?) great, who of the wine of_the rage of_the sexual_immorality of_her, she_has_given_to_drink all the pagans.
\v 9 And \add +an_\add*other angel third followed after_them, saying with \add +a_\add*voice loud: If anyone is_worshipping the wild_beast and the image of_it, and is_receiving \add +a_\add*mark on the forehead of_him, or on the hand of_him,
\v 10 also he will_be_drinking of the wine of_the rage of_ of_god, having_been_mixed undiluted in the cup of_the severe_anger of_him, and he_will_be_being_tormented in fire and sulfur before the angels \add +the_\add*holy and before the lamb.
\v 11 And the smoke of_the torment of_them to \add +the_\add*ages of_\add +the_\add*ages is_going_up, and not they_are_having rest, day and night, the \add >ones\add* worshipping the wild_beast and the image of_it, and if anyone is_receiving the mark of_the name of_it.
\v 12 Here the \add +the_\add*endurance of_the holy \add >ones\add* is, the \add >ones\add* keeping the commandments of_god, and the faith of_Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a).
\v 13 And I_heard of_\add +a_\add*voice out_of heaven saying: Write: Blessed \add =are\add* the dead in \add +the_\add*master dying_off from now. Yes, Is_saying the spirit: in_order_that they_will_be_being_rested from the labors of_them, the for works of_them is_following with them.
\v 14 And I_looked, and behold, \add +a_\add*cloud white, and on the cloud sitting \add >one\add* similar \add +the_\add*son of_man, having on the head of_him \add +a_\add*crown golden, and in the hand of_him \add +a_\add*sickle sharp.
\v 15 And another angel came_out crying_out of the temple, with \add +a_\add*voice loud to_the \add >one\add* sitting on the cloud: Send the sickle of_you and reap, because came the hour to_reap, because was_withered the harvest of_the earth.
\v 16 And cast the \add >one\add* sitting on the cloud the sickle of_him on the earth, and was_reaped the earth.
\v 17 And another angel came_out out_of the temple in heaven, having also he \add +a_\add*sickle sharp.
\v 18 And another angel out_of the altar, having authority over fire, and he_called with_\add +a_\add*voice loud to_the \add >one\add* having the sickle sharp saying: Send of_you the sickle sharp, and pick the clusters from_the vine of_the earth, because ripened the grapes of_it.
\v 19 And cast the angel the sickle of_him to the earth, and picked the vine of_the earth, and cast \add them\add* into the winepress of_the rage of_god great.
\v 20 And was_trodden the winepress outside the city, and came_out blood out_of the winepress, until the bridles of_the horses from thousand stadiums six_hundred.

\v 1 And I_saw another sign in heaven, great and marvellous, seven angels having seven plagues the last, because in them was_finished the rage of_god.
\v 2 And I_saw \add something\add* like \add +a_\add*sea glass having_been_mixed with_fire, and the \add >ones\add* overcoming of the wild_beast, and of the image of_it, and of the number of_the name of_it, having_stood on the sea glass, having harps of_god.
\v 3 And they_are_singing the song of_Mōsēs/(Mosheh), the slave of_god, and the song of_the lamb saying: Great and marvellous \add =are\add* the works of_you, master god almighty. Righteous and true \add =are\add* the ways of_you, king of_the ages.
\v 4 Who by_no_means not may_be_afraid, master, and will_be_glorifying the name of_you, because you_only devout \add =are\add*. Because all the nations will_be_coming and they_will_be_worshipping before you, because the just_acts of_you were_revealed.
\v 5 And after these \add >things\add* I_looked, and was_opened_up the temple of_the tabernacle of_the testimony in heaven,
\v 6 and came_out the seven angels having the seven plagues out_of of_the temple, having_dressed_in stone pure shining, and having_been_girded_about around their chests belts golden.
\v 7 And one of the four creatures gave to_the seven seven angels bowls golden, being_full of_the rage of_god, the \add >one\add* living to the ages of_the ages.
\v 8 And was_filled the temple with_smoke from the glory of_god, and from the power of_him, and no_one was_able to_come_in into the temple, until may_be_finished the seven seven plagues of_the angels.
\c 16
\v 1 And I_heard of_\add +a_\add*loud voice from the temple, saying to_the seven angels: Be_going and be_pouring_out the seven bowls of_the rage of_god into the earth.
\v 2 And went_away the first, and poured_out the bowl of_him on the earth, and it_became \add +an_\add*ulcer evil and evil on the people having the mark of_the wild_beast, and the \add >ones\add* worshipping before_the image of_it.
\v 3 And the second poured_out the bowl of_him into the sea, and it_became blood as of_\add +the_\add*dead, and every soul of_life died_off the \add >things\add* in the sea.
\v 4 And the third poured_out the bowl of_him into the rivers and the springs of_the waters, and they_became blood.
\v 5 And I_heard from_the angel of_the waters saying: Righteous you_are, the \add >one\add* being, and the \add >one\add* was, devout \add >one\add*, because these \add >things\add* you_judged.
\v 6 Because \add +the_\add*blood of_holy \add >ones\add* and of_prophets they_poured_out, and blood to_them have_given to_drink; worthy they_are.
\v 7 And I_heard of_the altar saying: Yes, master god almighty, true and righteous \add =are\add* the judgements of_you.
\v 8 And the fourth poured_out the bowl of_him on the sun, and was_given to_him to_scorch the people with fire.
\v 9 And were_scorched the people with_burning great, and they_slandered the name of_god, the \add >one\add* having authority over plagues these, and not they_repented to_give to_him glory.
\v 10 And the fifth poured_out the bowl of_him on the throne of_the wild_beast, and became the kingdom of_it having_been_darkened, and they_were_biting the tongues of_them out_of the misery,
\v 11 and they_slandered the god of_heaven for the miseries of_them, and for the ulcers of_them, and not they_repented of the works of_them.
\v 12 And the sixth poured_out the bowl of_him on the river great Eufratēs, and was_dried_up the water of_it, in_order_that may_be_prepared the way of_the kings of \add +the_\add*east sun.
\v 13 And I_saw out_of the mouth of_the dragon, and out_of the mouth of_the wild_beast, and out_of of_the mouth of_the false_prophet, three spirits unclean as_if frogs;
\v 14 for they_are spirits of_demons performing signs, to_be_going_out to the kings the inhabited_world whole, to_gather_together them to the war great day of_god almighty.
\v 15 (Behold, I_am_coming like \add +a_\add*thief. Blessed \add =is\add* the \add >one\add* watching and keeping the clothes of_him, in_order_that not naked he_may_be_walking, and they_may_be_seeing the shame of_him.)
\v 16 And he_gathered_together them to the place being_called In_Hebrew Armageddon.
\v 17 And the seventh poured_out the bowl of_him in the air, and came_out \add +a_\add*voice loud from the temple from the throne saying: It_has_become. 
\v 18 And became lightnings, and and voices, and thunders, \add +an_\add*earthquake became great, such_as not became, from of_which mankind became on the earth, \add +the_\add*so_great earthquake \add was\add* thus great.
\v 19 And became the city great into three parts, and the cities of_the nations fell, and Babulōn/(Bbāvel?) the great was_reminded before god, to_give to_her the cup of_the wine of_the rage of_the severe_anger of_him.
\v 20 And every island fled, and \add +the_\add*mountains not were_found.
\v 21 And \add +a_\add*hail great, about \add +a_\add*\add silver_\add*talent_weight, is_coming_down out_of the sky on the people, and slandered the people god, for the plague of_the hail, because great is the plague of_it exceedingly.
\c 17
\v 1 And came one of the seven angels of_the \add >ones\add* having the seven bowls, and he_spoke with me saying: Come, I_will_be_showing to_you the judgment of_the prostitute great sitting on waters many,
\v 2 with whom committed_sexual_immorality the kings of_the earth, and were_being_drunk the \add >ones\add* dwelling_in the earth with the wine of_the sexual_immorality of_her.
\v 3 And he_carried_away me into \add +a_\add*desert in \add +the_\add*spirit. And I_saw \add +a_\add*woman sitting on \add +a_\add*wild_beast scarlet, being_full with_names of_slander, having seven heads and ten horns.
\v 4 And the woman was having_been_clothed in_purple and scarlet, and having_been_gilded gold, and stone precious, and pearls, holding \add +a_\add*cup golden in the hand of_her, being_full of_abominations and the unclean of_the sexual_immorality of_her,
\v 5 and on the forehead of_her \add was\add* \add +a_\add*name having_been_written: Mystery Babulōn the great, the mother of_the prostitutes, and of_the abominations of_the earth.
\v 6 And I_saw the woman being_drunk with the blood of_the holy \add >ones\add*, and with the blood of_the witnesses of_Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a). And I_marvelled, having_seen her wonder great.
\v 7 And said to_me the angel: For_reason why you_marvelled. I you will_be_telling the mystery of_the woman, and of_the wild_beast bearing her, having the seven heads and the ten horns.
\v 8 The wild_beast that you_saw was, and not is, and is_going to_be_going_up out_of the abyss, and into destruction to_be_going. And will_be_marvelling the \add >ones\add* dwelling on the earth, whose not has_been_written the names in the scroll of_life from \add +the_\add*foundation of_\add +the_\add*earth, seeing the wild_beast, that it_was and not is and_yet will_be_being_present.
\v 9 Here \add =is\add* the mind having seven: wisdom the seven heads mountains are, where the woman is_sitting on them. And seven kings are:
\v 10 five fell, one is, the other not_yet came, and whenever he_may_come, \add +a_\add*little \add time\add* him it_is_fitting to_remain
\v 11 and the wild_beast which was, and not is, also himself \add +an_\add*eighth is, and of the seven it_is, and into destruction it_is_going.
\v 12 And the ten horns which you_saw, ten kings are, who \add +a_\add*kingdom thus received, but authority as for_one kings hour they_are_receiving with the wild_beast.
\v 13 These one opinion are_having, and the power and the authority of_them to_the wild_beast they_are_giving.
\v 14 These with the lamb will_be_warring, and the lamb will_be_overcoming them, because master of_lords he_is and king of_kings, and the \add >ones\add* with him, called, and chosen, and faithful.
\v 15 And he_is_saying to_me: The waters that you_saw, where the prostitute is_sitting, peoples and crowds are, and nations and tongues.
\v 16 And the ten horns that you_saw and the wild_beast, these will_be_hating the prostitute, and having_been_desolated they_will_be_making her and naked, and the fleshes of_her they_will_be_eating, and her they_will_be_burning_up with with_fire.
\v 17 For god gave into the hearts of_them to_do the opinion of_him, and to_do one opinion, and to_give the kingdom of_them to_the wild_beast, until will_be_being_accomplished the words of_god.
\v 18 And the woman whom you_saw is the city great, having \add +a_\add*kingdom over the kings of_the earth.
\c 18
\v 1 After these \add >things\add* I_saw another angel coming_down out_of heaven, having authority great, and the earth was_illuminated with the glory of_him.
\v 2 And he_cried_out with \add +a_\add*mighty voice saying: Fell, fell Babulōn/(Bbāvel?) the great. And it_became \add +a_\add*dwelling_place of_demons, and \add +a_\add*prison of_every spirit unclean, and \add +a_\add*prison of_every bird unclean, and having_been_hated.
\v 3 Because of of_the rage of_the sexual_immorality of_her, have_drunk all the nations, and the kings of_the earth with her committed_sexual_immorality, and the merchants of_the earth by the power of_the sensuality of_her became_rich.
\v 4 And I_heard another voice from heaven saying: Come_out the people of_me out_of her, in_order_that not you_all_may_participate in_the sins of_her, and of the plagues of_her, in_order_that not you_all_may_receive,
\v 5 because were_joined_together of_her sins until heaven, and remembered god the wrongs of_her.
\v 6 Give_back to_her as also she gave_back, and double the double, according_to the works of_her; in the cup which she_mixed, mix to_her double,
\v 7 as_much_as she_glorified herself and lived_sensuously, so_much give to_her torment and mourning. Because in the heart of_her she_is_saying, I_am_sitting queen… and \add +a_\add*widow not I_am and mourning by_no_means not I_may_have_known.
\v 8 Because_of this, in one day will_be_coming the plagues of_her, death, and mourning, and famine, and with fire she_will_be_being_burned_up, because mighty \add =is\add* \add +the_\add*master god having_judged her.
\v 9 And will_be_weeping and will_be_mourning for her the kings of_the earth, with her having_committed_sexual_immorality and having_lived_sensuously, whenever they_may_be_seeing the smoke of_the burning of_her,
\v 10 from afar having_stood, because_of the fear of_the torment of_her saying: Woe, woe, the city great Babulōn, the city strong. Because in_one hour came the judgment of_you.
\v 11 And the merchants of_the earth are_weeping and are_mourning for her, because the cargo of_them no_one is_buying no_longer–
\v 12 cargo of_gold, and of_silver, and of_stone precious, and of_pearls, and of_linen, and of_purple, and of_silk, and of_scarlet, and all wood citron, and every object ivory, and every object of wood most_precious, and of_bronze, and of_iron, and of_marble,
\v 13 and cinnamon, and amomum, and incenses, and ointment, and frankincense, and wine, and olive_oil, and fine_flour, and wheat, and cattle, and sheep, and of_horses, and of_carriages, and of_bodies, and souls of_humans.
\v 14 And the fruit of_you of_the desire of_the soul went_away from you, and all the sleek \add >things\add* and splendid \add >things\add* destroyed from you, and no_longer by_no_means not them will_be_finding.
\v 15 The merchants of_these \add >things\add* having_become_rich, from her from afar will_be_standing, because_of the fear of_the torment of_her, weeping and mourning
\v 16 saying: Woe, woe, you city great, having_been_clothed in_linen, and purple, and scarlet, and having_been_gilded with gold, and stone precious, and pearl. 
\v 17 Because in_one hour was_desolated so_much riches. And every captain, and every the \add >one\add* to \add +a_\add*place sailing, and sailors, and as_many_as the sea are_working, from afar stood
\v 18 and they_cried_out, seeing the smoke of_the burning of_her saying: What \add =is\add* similar to_the city great. 
\v 19 And they_cast dust on the heads of_them, and they_cried_out, weeping and mourning saying: Woe, woe, the city great, in which became_rich all the \add >ones\add* having the ships in the sea by the wealth of_her. Because in_one hour she_was_desolated.
\v 20 Be_being_gladdened over her, heaven, and holy \add >ones\add*, and ambassadors, and prophets, because judged god the judgment for_you_all by her.
\v 21 And took_up one angel \add +a_\add*stone mighty like stone great, and he_cast \add it\add* into the sea saying: Thus with_violence will_be_being_cast Babulōn/(Bbāvel?) the great city, and by_no_means not it_may_be_found anymore.
\v 22 And \add +the_\add*sound of_harpists, and musicians, and flute_players, and trumpeters, by_no_means not may_be_heard in you anymore, and every craftsman by_no_means not may_be_found in you anymore, and \add +the_\add*sound of_\add +a_\add*millstone by_no_means not may_be_heard in you anymore,
\v 23 and \add +the_\add*light of_lamp by_no_means not may_shine in you anymore, and \add +the_\add*voice of_\add +a_\add*bridegroom and of_\add +a_\add*bride by_no_means not may_be_heard in you anymore; because the merchants of_you were the magnates of_the earth, because by the sorcery of_you were_deceived all the nations.
\v 24 And in her \add +the_\add*blood of_prophets and of_holy \add >ones\add* was_found, and of_all the \add >ones\add* having_been_slain on the earth.
\c 19
\v 1 After these \add >things\add* I_heard \add something\add* like \add +a_\add*voice loud of_\add +a_\add*crowd great in heaven saying: Hallelujah. salvation, and glory, and power \add be\add*, of_the god of_us. 
\v 2 Because true and righteous \add =are\add* the judgements of_him, because he_judged the prostitute great, who was_corrupting the earth with the sexual_immorality of_her, and he_avenged the blood of_the slaves of_him out_of \add +the_\add*hand of_her.
\v 3 And secondly they_have_said: Hallelujah. And the smoke of_her is_going_up to the ages of_the ages.
\v 4 And fell the elders twenty four, and the four creatures, and they_worshipped to_god, the \add >one\add* sitting on the throne saying: Amen. Hallelujah. 
\v 5 And \add +a_\add*voice from the throne came_out saying: Be_praising unto_the god of_us, all the slaves of_him, the \add >ones\add* revering him, the small and the great. 
\v 6 And I_heard \add something\add* like \add +the_\add*voice of_\add +a_\add*crowd great, and as \add +the_\add*sound of_waters many, and like \add +a_\add*sound of_thunders mighty saying: Hallelujah, because reigned \add +the_\add*master, the god of_us almighty.
\v 7 We_may_be_rejoicing and may_be_exulting, and we_may_give the glory to_him, because came the wedding of_the lamb, and the wife of_him prepared herself.
\v 8 And it_was_given to_her, in_order_that she_may_clothe \add herself\add* in_linen shining clean, for the linen the just_acts of_the holy \add >ones\add* is.
\v 9 And he_is_saying to_me: Write: Blessed \add =are\add* the \add >ones\add* to the supper of_the wedding of_the lamb having_been_invited. And he_is_saying to_me: These words true are. of_god.
\v 10 And I_fell before the feet of_him to_worship before_him. And he_is_saying to_me: Be_seeing \add to_it\add* not; \add +a_\add*fellow-slave of_you I_am, and the brothers of_you holding the testimony of_Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a); before_god worship. For the testimony of_Yēsous is the spirit of_prophecy.
\v 11 And I_saw heaven having_been_opened_up, and behold, \add +a_\add*horse white, and the \add >one\add* sitting on it, Faithful being_called and True, and in righteousness he_is_judging and is_warring.
\v 12 And the eyes of_him \add =are\add* \add +a_\add*flame of_fire, and on the head of_him crowns many, having name having_been_written, which no_one has_known, except he,
\v 13 and having_been_clothed in_\add +a_\add*robe having_been_dipped in_blood, and has_been_called the \add +the_\add*name of_him, the Word of_god.
\v 14 And the armies in heaven was_following after_him on horses white, having_dressed_in linen white pure.
\v 15 And out_of the mouth of_him is_going_out \add +a_\add*sword sharp, in_order_that with it he_may_strike the nations: and he will_be_shepherding them with \add +a_\add*rod iron; and he is_treading the winepress of_the wine of_the rage of_the severe_anger of_god almighty.
\v 16 And he_is_having on his robe and on the thigh of_him, \add +a_\add*name having_been_written: king of_kings and master of_lords.
\v 17 And I_saw one angel having_stood in the sun, and he_cried_out with \add +a_\add*voice loud, saying to_all the birds flying in midair: Come, be_gathered_together to the supper great of_god,
\v 18 in_order_that you_all_may_eat \add +the_\add*fleshes of_kings, and fleshes of_commanders, and \add +the_\add*fleshes of_mighty, and \add +the_\add*fleshes of_horses, and of_the \add >ones\add* sitting on them, and \add +the_\add*fleshes of_all, free \add men\add* both and slaves, and small and great.
\v 19 And I_saw the wild_beast, and the kings of_the earth, and the armies of_them, having_been_gathered_together to_make war with the \add >one\add* sitting on the horse, and with the army of_him.
\v 20 And was_caught the wild_beast, and with him the \add +the_\add*false_prophet, the \add >one\add* having_done the signs before him, by which he_deceived the \add >ones\add* having_received the mark of_the wild_beast, and the \add >ones\add* worshipping before_the image of_him.

\v 21 And the rest were_killed_off with the sword of_the \add >one\add* sitting on the horse, having_come_out out_of the mouth of_him, and all the birds were_satisfied with the fleshes of_them.
\c 20
\v 1 And I_saw \add +an_\add*angel coming_down out_of heaven, holding the key of_the abyss, and \add +a_\add*chain great in the hand of_him.
\v 2 And he_apprehended the dragon, the serpent ancient, who is \add +the_\add*Devil and Satan/(Sāţān), and he_bound him for_\add +a_\add*thousand years,
\v 3 and he_cast him into the abyss, and shut and sealed \add it\add* over him, in_order_that not he_may_deceive anymore the nations, until may_be_finished the thousand years; after these \add >things\add*, it_is_fitting him to_be_released \add +a_\add*little time.
\v 4 And I_saw thrones, and they_sat_down on them, and judgment was_given to_them, and the souls of_the \add >ones\add* having_been_beheaded because_of the testimony of_Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a), and because_of the word of_god, and whoever neither worshipped the wild_beast, nor the image of_him, and not took the mark on their forehead, and on the hand of_them; and they_lived and reigned with the for_\add +a_\add*Thousand messiah years.

\v 9 And they_went_up on the breadth of_the earth, and surrounded the camp of_the holy \add >ones\add*, and the city having_been_loved. But came_down fire out_of the sky and it_devoured them.
\v 10 And the devil, the \add >one\add* deceiving them, was_cast into the lake of_fire and of_sulfur, where \add were\add* also the wild_beast and the false_prophet, and they_will_be_being_tormented day and night for the ages of_the ages.

And were_judged the dead out_of the \add >things\add* having_been_written in the scrolls according_to the works of_them.
\v 13 And gave the sea the dead in it, and death and Hadēs gave the dead in them, and they_were_judged each according_to the works of_them.
\v 14 And death and Hadēs were_cast into the lake of_fire. This the second death is, the lake of_fire.
\v 15 And if anyone not was_found in the scroll of_life having_been_written, he_was_cast into the lake of_fire.

\v 1 And I_saw \add +a_\add*heaven new and \add +an_\add*earth new; for the \add +the_\add*first heaven and the first earth went_away, and the sea not is anymore.
\v 2 And the city holy, Hierousalēm/(Yərūshālam) \add +the_\add*new, I_saw coming_down out_of heaven from god, having_been_prepared as \add +a_\add*bride, having_been_adorned for_the husband of_her.
\v 3 And I_heard of_\add +a_\add*voice great out_of the throne saying: Behold, the tabernacle of_god \add =is\add* with humans, and he_will_be_sheltering with them, and they \add +the_\add*peoples of_him will_be, and himself god will_be with them,
