\v 1 In \add +the\add*_beginning was the word, and the word was with \nd god\nd*, and \nd god\nd* was the word.
\v 2 This \add >one\add* was in \add +the\add*_beginning with \nd god\nd*.
\v 3 All \add >things\add* became through him, and without him not_even one \add >thing\add* became that has_become.
\v 4 In him was life, and the life was the light of_mankind.
\v 5 And the light in the darkness is_shining, and it grasped not the darkness.
\v 6 Became \add +a\add*_man having_been_sent_out from \nd god\nd*, G‹Yōannēs›G \add +the\add*_name to_him \add was\add*.
\v 7 This \add >one\add* came for \add +a\add*_testimony, in_order_that he_may_testify concerning the light, in_order_that all may_believe through him.
\v 8 That \add >one\add* was not the light, but in_order_that he_may_testify concerning the light.
\v 9 It_was the true light, which is_enlightening every person, coming into the world.
\v 10 He_was in the world, and the world became through him, and the world knew not him.
\v 11 He_came to his own, and his own not received him.
\v 12 But as_many_as received him, he_gave to_them \add +the\add*_right to_become children of_\nd god\nd*, to_the \add >ones\add* believing in the name of_him,
\v 13 who neither of bloods, nor of will of_flesh, nor of will of_man, but were_become of \nd god\nd*.
\v 14 And the word became flesh and sheltered among us, and we_saw the glory of_him, \add +a\add*_glory as of_\add +an\add*_only_begotten with \add +a\add*_father, full of_grace and truth.
\v 15 G‹Yōannēs›G is_testifying concerning him, and he_has_cried_out saying: This \add >one\add* was whom I_said: The \add >one\add* coming after me, has_become before of_me, because he_was before me.
\v 16 Because of the fullness of_him, we all received and grace for grace.
\v 17 Because the law was_given through G‹H‹Mōsēs/(Mosheh)›H›G, grace and truth became through \nd G‹H‹Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a)›H›G\nd* \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd*.
\v 18 No_one has_ ever _seen \nd god\nd*, \add +the\add*_only_begotten \nd god\nd*, the \add >one\add* being in the bosom of_the father, that \add >one\add* explained \add ~him\add*.
\v 19 And this is the testimony of_G‹Yōannēs›G, when the G‹Youdaiōns›G sent_out priests and G‹H‹Leuitēs/(from_tribe_of_Lēvī)›H›Gs from G‹H‹Hierousalēm/(Yərūshālam)›H›G, in_order_that they_may_ask him: Who are you. 
\v 20 And he_confessed and not disowned, but confessed, I am not the \nd chosen_one\nd*.
\v 21 And they_asked him, what therefore You are G‹H‹Ēlias/('Ēliyyāh)›H›G. And he_is_saying: I_am not. Are you the prophet. And he_answered: No.
\v 22 Therefore they_said to_him: Who you_are. In_order_that we_may_give \add +an\add*_answer to_the \add >ones\add* having_sent us. What you_are_saying about yourself. 
\v 23 He_was_saying: I \add =am\add* \add +a\add*_voice shouting in the desert: Straighten the way of_\add +the\add*_\nd master\nd*, as G‹H‹Ēsaias/(Yəsha'əyāh)›H›G the prophet said.
\v 24 And having_been_sent_out they_were from the G‹Farisaios_\add sect\add*›G.
\v 25 And they_asked him and they_said to_him: Therefore why you_are_immersing, if you not are the \nd chosen_one\nd*, nor G‹H‹Ēlias, nor the prophet. 
\v 26 G‹Yōannēs›G answered to_them saying: I am_immersing with water, in_\add +the\add*_midst of_you_all ˱one˲_has_stood whom you_all not have_known,
\v 27 the \add >one\add* coming after me, of_whom not am I worthy, that I_may_untie the strap of_the sandal of_him.
\v 28 These \add >things\add* became in G‹Bēthania›G, beyond the G‹H‹Yordanēs/(Yarəddēn)›H›G, where G‹Yōannēs›G was immersing.
\v 29 On_the \add day\add* of_next he_is_seeing \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* coming to him, and is_saying: See the lamb of_\nd god\nd*, taking_away the sin of_the world.
\v 30 This \add >one\add* it_is concerning whom I said: After me is_coming \add +a\add*_man, who has_become before me, because he_was before me.
\v 31 And_I had_ not _known him, but in_order_that may_be_revealed to_Rx-G‹H‹Israēl/(Yisərā'ēl)›H›G-Rx because_of this, I came immersing with water.
\v 32 And G‹Yōannēs›G testified saying, I_have_seen the \nd spirit\nd* coming_down as \add +a\add*_dove out_of heaven, and it_remained on him.
\v 33 And_I had_ not _known him, but the \add >one\add* having_sent me to_be_immersing with water, that \add >one\add* said to_me: On whom you_may_see the \nd spirit\nd* coming_down and remaining on him, he is the \add >one\add* immersing with \add +the\add*_ holy _\nd spirit\nd*.
\v 34 And_I have_seen and have_testified that this is the son of_\nd god\nd*.
\v 35 On_the \add day\add* of_next again G‹Yōannēs›G had_stood, and two of the apprentices/followers of_him.
\v 36 And having_focused_in on_\nd G‹H‹Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a)›H›G\nd* walking he_is_saying: See the lamb of_\nd god\nd*. 
\v 37 And the two apprentices/followers of_him heard speaking, and they_followed after_\nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd*.
\v 38 But \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* having_been_turned, and having_seen them following, he_is_saying to_them: What you_all_are_seeking. And they said to_him: , My_great_\add >one\add* (which is_being_called being_translated: Teacher): Where you_are_remaining. 
\v 39 He_is_saying to_them: Be_coming and you_all_will_be_seeing. Therefore they_came and saw where he_is_remaining, and they_remained with him that day, \add +the\add*_hour was about \add +the\add*_tenth.
\v 40 G‹Andreas›G the brother of_Rx-G‹Simōn›G-Rx G‹Petros›G was, one of the two having_heard from G‹Yōannēs›G, and having_followed after_him.
\v 41 This \add >one\add* first is_finding the his own brother Rx-G‹Simōn›G-Rx, and is_saying to_him: We_have_found the chosen_one/messiah, (which is being_translated: \add +the\add*_\nd chosen_one\nd*).
\v 42 he_led him to \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd*. Having_focused_in on_him, \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* said: You are Rx-G‹Simōn›G-Rx the son of_G‹Yōannēs›G, you will_be_being_called G‹Kēfas›G, (which is_being_translated: \add +the\add*_Stone|G‹Petros›G).
\v 43 On_the \add day\add* of_next he_wanted to_come_out into G‹H‹Galilaia/(Gālīl)›H›G. And he_is_finding Rx-G‹Filippos›G-Rx, and \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* is_saying to_him : Be_following after_me.
\v 44 And Rx-G‹Filippos›G-Rx was from G‹Bēthsaida›G, of the city of_G‹Andreas›G and G‹Petros›G.
\v 45 Rx-G‹Filippos›G-Rx is_finding G‹Nathanaēl›G, and he_is_saying to_him: We_have_found whom wrote G‹H‹Mōsēs/(Mosheh)›H›G in the law and the prophets, \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* son of_G‹H‹Yōsēf/(Yōşēf)›H›G, who \add =is\add* from G‹Nazaret›G.
\v 46 And G‹Nathanaēl›G said to_him: Is_able any good to_be out_of G‹Nazaret›G. Rx-G‹Filippos›G-Rx is_saying to_him: Be_coming and see.
\v 47 \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* saw G‹Nathanaēl›G coming to him and he_is_saying concerning him: See truly \add +an\add*_Israelite in whom is not deceit.
\v 48 G‹Nathanaēl›G is_saying to_him: From_where you_are_knowing me. \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* answered and said to_him: Before the \add time\add* Rx-G‹Filippos›G-Rx to_call you, being under the fig_tree, I_saw you.
\v 49 G‹Nathanaēl›G answered to_him: , My_great_\add >one\add*, you are the son of_\nd god\nd*, you are king of_Rx-G‹H‹Israēl/(Yisərā'ēl)›H›G-Rx.
\v 50 \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* answered and said to_him: Because I_said to_you that I_saw you beneath the fig_tree, you_are_believing. You_will_be_seeing greater \add =than\add* these \add >things\add*.
\v 51 And he_is_saying to_him: Truly, truly, I_am_saying to_you_all, you_all_will_be_seeing heaven having_opened_up, and the angels of_\nd god\nd* going_up and coming_down on the son of_Man.

\v 1 And on_the third day \add +a\add*_wedding became in Rx-G‹Kana›G-Rx of_G‹H‹Galilaia, and the mother of_\nd G‹H‹Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a)›H›G\nd* was there.
\v 2 And \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* was_ also _invited and the apprentices/followers of_him to the wedding.
\v 3 And having_been_deficient of_wine, the mother of_\nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* is_saying to him: They_are_ not _having wine.
\v 4 And \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* is_saying to_her: What to_me and to_you, woman. The hour of_me is_ not_yet _coming.
\v 5 The mother of_him is_saying to_the servants: Do whatever anything he_may_be_saying to_you_all.
\v 6 And six stone waterpots were lying there according_to the purification of_the G‹Youdaiōns›G, having_room_for two or three measures each.
\v 7 Is_saying to_them \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd*: Fill the waterpots with_water. And they_filled them to upward.
\v 8 And he_is_saying to_them: Draw now and be_carrying to_the \add +the\add*_headwaiter. And they carried \add it\add*.
\v 9 And when the \add +the\add*_headwaiter tasted the water having_been_become wine, and had_ not _known from_where is, but the servants had_known the \add >ones\add* having_drawn the water, the headwaiter is_calling the bridegroom
\v 10 and he_is_saying to_him: Every person is_presenting first the good wine, and the lessor whenever they_may_be_being_drunk, you have_kept the good wine until now.
\v 11 This beginning of_the signs \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* did in Rx-G‹Kana›G-Rx of_G‹H‹Galilaia/(Gālīl)›H›G, and revealed the glory of_him, and the apprentices/followers of_him believed in him.
\v 12 After this he_came_down to G‹Kafarna'oum›G, he and the mother of_him, and the brothers and the apprentices/followers of_him, and they_remained there not many days.
\v 13 And the passover_\add feast\add* of_the G‹Youdaiōns›G was near, and \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* went_up to G‹H‹Hierousalēm/(Yərūshālam)›H›G.
\v 14 And he_found in the temple the \add >ones\add* selling oxen and sheep and doves, and the money-changers sitting.
\v 15 And having_made as \add +a\add*_whip of cords, all he_throw_out both the sheep and oxen from the temple, and he_poured_out the coins of_the moneychangers, and he_overturned the tables.
\v 16 And to_the \add >ones\add* selling doves he_said: Take_away these \add >things\add* from_here, not be_making the house of_the father of_me \add +a\add*_house of_business.
\v 17 the apprentices/followers of_him /Were/_reminded that having_been_written it_is: the zeal of_the house of_you will_be_consuming me.
\v 18 Therefore the G‹Youdaiōns›G answered and said to_him: What sign you_are_showing to_us, that you_are_doing these \add >things\add*. 
\v 19 \nd G‹H‹Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a)›H›G\nd* answered and said to_them: Destroy this the temple, and I_will_be_raising it in three days.
\v 20 Therefore the G‹Youdaiōns›G said: This temple was_built for_forty and six years, and you will_be_raising it in three days. 
\v 21 But that \add >one\add* was_speaking concerning the temple of_the body of_him.
\v 22 Therefore when he_was_raised from \add +the\add*_dead, the apprentices/followers of_him were_reminded that he_was_saying this, and they_believed in_the scripture and the word that \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* spoke.
\v 23 And when he_was in G‹H‹Hierousalēm at the passover_ at the feast, many believed on the name of_him, observing of_him the signs which he_was_doing.
\v 24 But \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* himself not was_entrusting himself to_them, because_of that him to_be_knowing all \add men\add*.
\v 25 And that he_was_having no need that anyone may_testify concerning mankind, for he was_knowing what was in the person.
\c 3
\v 1 And was \add +a\add*_man of the G‹Farisaios_\add sect\add*›G, G‹Nikodēmos›G \add +the\add*_name to_him, \add +a\add*_ruler of_the G‹Youdaiōns›G, 
\v 2 this \add >one\add* came to him by_night, and said to_him: , My_great_\add >one\add*, we_have_known that you_have_come from \nd god\nd* as_\add +a\add*_teacher, for no_one is_able to_be_doing these signs, what you are_doing, if \nd god\nd* not may_be with him.
\v 3 \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* answered and said to_him: Truly, truly, I_am_saying to_you, if anyone not may_be_born again, he_is_ not _able to_see the kingdom of_\nd god\nd*.
\v 4 G‹Nikodēmos›G is_saying to him: How is_ \add +a\add*_person _able to_be_born, being old. He_is_ not _able to_come_in into the womb of_the mother of_him secondly and to_be_born. 
\v 5 \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* answered: Truly, truly, I_am_telling to_you, if anyone not may_be_born of water and of_\nd spirit\nd*, he_is_ not _able to_come_in into the kingdom of_\nd god\nd*.
\v 6 The \add >thing\add* having_been_born of the flesh, is flesh, and the \add >thing\add* having_been_born of the \nd spirit\nd*, is spirit.
\v 7 You_may_ not _wonder that I_said to_you: It_is_fitting you_all to_be_born again.
\v 8 The spirit it_is_blowing where is_wanting, and you_are_hearing the sound of_it, but you_have_ not _known from_where it_is_coming, and where it_is_going, thus is everyone having_been_born of the \nd spirit\nd*.
\v 9 G‹Nikodēmos›G answered and said to_him: How is_ these \add >things\add* _able to_become. 
\v 10 \nd G‹H‹Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a)›H›G\nd* answered and said to_him: You are the teacher of_Rx-G‹H‹Israēl/(Yisərā'ēl)›H›G-Rx, and you_are_ not _knowing these \add >things\add*. 
\v 11 Truly, truly, I_am_saying to_you that we_are_speaking what we_have_known, and we_are_testifying what we_have_seen, and you_all_are_ not _receiving the testimony of_us.
\v 12 If I_told the earthly \add >things\add* to_you_all, and you_all_are_ not _believing, how you_all_will_be_believing if I_may_tell to_you_all the heavenly \add >things\add*. 
\v 13 And no_one has_gone_up into heaven, except the \add >one\add* having_come_down out_of heaven, the son of_Man.
\v 14 And as G‹H‹Mōsēs/(Mosheh)›H›G exalted the serpent in the desert, thus it_is_fitting the son of_Man to_be_exalted,
\v 15 in_order_that everyone believing in him may_be_having eternal life.
\v 16 For thus \nd god\nd* loved the world, so_that he_gave the only_begotten son, in_order_that everyone believing in him may_ not _perish, but may_be_having eternal life.
\v 17 For \nd god\nd* not sent_out his son into the world, in_order_that he_may_judge the world, but in_order_that the world may_be_saved through him.
\v 18 The \add >one\add* believing in him not is_being_judged. But the \add >one\add* not believing, has_been_ already _judged, because he_has_ not _believed in the name of_the only_begotten son of_\nd god\nd*.
\v 19 And this is the judgment, that light has_come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the light, for the works of_them was evil.
\v 20 For everyone doing evil, is_hating the light, and is_ not _coming to the light, in_order_that the works of_him may_be_ not _rebuked.
\v 21 But the \add >one\add* practicing the truth, is_coming to the light, in_order_that the works of_him may_be_revealed, that it_is having_been_worked in \nd god\nd*.
\v 22 After these \add >things\add* and \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* the apprentices/followers of_him came into the Judean land, and there he_was_staying with them and was_immersing.
\v 23 And G‹Yōannēs›G was also immersing in G‹Ainōn›G near G‹Saleim›G, because much water was there, and they_were_arriving and were_being_immersed.
\v 24 For G‹Yōannēs›G was not_yet having_been_throw into the prison.
\v 25 Therefore became \add +a\add*_debate of the apprentices/followers of_G‹Yōannēs›G with \add +a\add*_Rx-G‹Youdaios›G-Rx about purification.
\v 26 And they_came to G‹Yōannēs›G and they_said to_him: , My_great_\add >one\add*, who was with you beyond the G‹H‹Yordanēs/(Yarəddēn)›H›G, to_whom you have_testified, see, this \add >one\add* is_immersing and all are_coming to him.
\v 27 G‹Yōannēs›G answered and said: \add +A\add*_person is_ not _able to_be_receiving, not_even one if not it_may_be having_been_given to_him from heaven.
\v 28 Yourselves you_all are_testifying to_me that I_said: I am not the \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd*, but, Having_been_sent_out I_am before that \add >one\add*.
\v 29 The \add >one\add* having the bride, is \add +the\add*_bridegroom, but the friend of_the bridegroom, the \add >one\add* having_stood and hearing from_him, is_rejoicing with_joy because_of the voice of_the bridegroom. Therefore this my joy has_been_fulfilled.
\v 30 That \add >one\add* it_is_fitting to_be_increasing, but me to_be_being_made_less.
\v 31 The \add >one\add* coming from_above, is above all. The \add >one\add* being from the earth, is from the earth, and is_speaking from the earth. The \add >one\add* coming from heaven, is above all.
\v 32 What he_has_seen and heard, this he_is_testifying, but no_one is_receiving the testimony of_him.
\v 33 The \add >one\add* having_received of_him the testimony, he_sealed that \nd god\nd* is true.
\v 34 For whom \nd god\nd* sent_out, is_speaking the words of_\nd god\nd*, for he_is_giving the \nd spirit\nd* not by measure.
\v 35 The father is_loving the son, and has_given all \add >things\add* in the hand of_him.
\v 36 The \add >one\add* believing in the son, is_having eternal life, but the \add >one\add* disbelieving in_the son, not will_be_seeing life, but the severe_anger of_\nd god\nd* is_remaining on him.
\c 4
\v 1 Therefore when the \nd master\nd* knew that the G‹Farisaios_\add sect\add*›G heard that \nd G‹H‹Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a)›H›G\nd* is_making and is_immersing more apprentices/followers than G‹Yōannēs›G
\v 2 (and_yet_indeed \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* himself was_ not _immersing, but the apprentices/followers of_him),
\v 3 he_left Rx-G‹Youdaia›G-Rx and went_away again into G‹H‹Galilaia/(Gālīl)›H›G.
\v 4 And it_was_fitting him to_be_passing_through through G‹H‹Samareia/(Shomərōn)›H›G.
\v 5 Therefore he_is_coming to \add +a\add*_city of_G‹H‹Samareia being_called G‹Suⱪar›G, near the property which G‹H‹Yakōb/(Ya'aqov)›H›G gave to_G‹H‹Yōsēf/(Yōşēf)›H›G, the son of_him, 
\v 6 and well of_G‹H‹Yakōb was there. Therefore \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* having_wearied from the journey, was_sitting thus at the well. \add +The\add*_hour was about \add +the\add*_sixth.
\v 7 \add +a\add*_woman out_of G‹H‹Samareia is_coming to_draw water. \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* is_saying to_her: Give to_me to_drink, 
\v 8 for the apprentices/followers of_him had_gone_away into the city, in_order_that they_may_buy food.
\v 9 Therefore the Rx-G‹H‹from_Samareia/(Shomərōn)›H›G-Rx woman is_saying to_him: How you being \add +a\add*_Rx-G‹Youdaios›G-Rx, are_requesting to_drink from me of_\add +a\add*_woman being Rx-G‹H‹from_Samareia/(Shomərōn)›H›G-Rx. For G‹Youdaiōns›G are_ not _having_association_with with_G‹H‹Samareitēs/(Shomərōn)›H›G.
\v 10 \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* answered and said to_her: If you_had_known the gift of_\nd god\nd*, and who is saying to_you: Give to_me to_drink, you would requested him, and he_ would _gave to_you living water.
\v 11 The woman is_saying to_him: Sir, neither you_are_having bucket and the well is deep, therefore from_where you_are_having the living water. 
\v 12 You are not greater \add =than\add* the father of_us G‹H‹Yakōb, who has_given the well to_us, and drank of it himself, and the sons of_him, and the livestock of_him. 
\v 13 \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* answered and said to_her: Everyone drinking of the this water, will_be_thirsting again, 
\v 14 but whoever may_drink of the water that I will_be_giving to_him, by_no_means will_ not _be_thirsting, for the age, but the water that I_will_be_giving to_him will_be_becoming in him \add +a\add*_spring of_water, springing_up into eternal life.
\v 15 The woman is_saying to him: Sir, give this water to_me, in_order_that I _may_ not _be_thirsting, nor I_am_passing_through here to_be_drawing.
\v 16 He_is_saying to_her: Be_going, call the husband of_you and come here.
\v 17 The woman answered and said to_him: I_am_ not _having \add +a\add*_husband. \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* is_saying to_her: You_said rightly, I_am_ not _having \add +a\add*_husband, 
\v 18 for you_had five husbands, and now he_whom you_are_having, is not husband of_you, this you_have_spoken true.
\v 19 The woman is_saying to_him: Sir, I_am_perceiving that you are \add +a\add*_prophet.
\v 20 The fathers of_us worshipped on this mountain, and you_all are_saying that in G‹H‹Hierousalēm/(Yərūshālam)›H›G is the place where it_is_fitting to_be_worshipping.
\v 21 \nd G‹H‹Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a)›H›G\nd* is_saying to_her: Be_believing in_me, woman, because \add +an\add*_hour is_coming, when neither on this mountain, nor in G‹H‹Hierousalēm, will_you_all_be_worshipping before_the father.
\v 22 You_all are_worshipping what you_all_have_ not _known, we are_worshipping what we_have_known, because salvation is of the G‹Youdaiōns›G.
\v 23 But \add +an\add*_hour is_coming and now is, when the true worshipers will_be_worshipping before_the father in spirit and truth, for the father also is_seeking such, the \add >ones\add* worshipping him.
\v 24 \nd god\nd* \add =is\add* \nd spirit\nd*, and the \add >ones\add* worshipping him it_is_fitting in spirit and truth. to_be_worshipping.
\v 25 The woman is_saying to_him: I_have_known that \add +the\add*_chosen_one/messiah is_coming, who \add =is\add* being_called \add +the\add*_\nd chosen_one\nd*, whenever that \add >one\add* may_come, he_will_be_declaring all \add >things\add* to_us.
\v 26 \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* is_saying to_her: I am \add he\add*, the \add >one\add* speaking to_you.
\v 27 And after this the apprentices/followers of_him came, and they_were_Rx-marvelling-Rx that he_was_speaking with \add +a\add*_woman, however no_one said: What are_you_seeking. Or: Why are_you_speaking with her. 
\v 28 Therefore the woman left the waterpot of_her, and she_went_away into the city, and she_is_saying to_the people,
\v 29 Come, see \add +a\add*_man who told to_me all \add >things\add* as_much_as I_did, surely_not this is the \nd chosen_one\nd*. 
\v 30 They_came_out out_of the city, and they_were_coming to him.
\v 31 In the \add time\add* meanwhile the apprentices/followers were_asking him saying: , My_great_\add >one\add*, eat.
\v 32 But he said to_them: I am_having food to_eat, that you_all have_ not _known.
\v 33 Therefore the apprentices/followers were_saying to one_another: Not anyone brought to_him \add something\add* to_eat. 
\v 34 \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* is_saying to_them: My food is that I_may_do the will of_the \add >one\add* having_sent me, and I_may_complete the work of_him.
\v 35 Not you_all are_saying, Still four_month it_is and the harvest is_coming. See I_am_saying to_you_all, lift_up the eyes of_you_all and see the fields, because they_are already white toward harvest.
\v 36 The \add >one\add* reaping is_receiving \add +a\add*_reward, and is_gathering_together fruit to eternal life, in_order_that the \add >one\add* sowing and the \add >one\add* reaping may_be_rejoicing together.
\v 37 For the statement in this is the true: Another \add >one\add* is sowing, and another \add >one\add* reaping.
\v 38 I sent_ you_all _out to_be_reaping what you_all have_ not _labored, others have_labored, and you_all have_come_in into the labor of_them.
\v 39 And many of_the G‹H‹Samareitēs/(Shomərōn)›H›G out_of of_ that _city, believed on him, because_of the word of_the woman testifying, He_told to_me all \add >things\add* whatever I_did.
\v 40 Therefore when the G‹H‹Samareitēs came to him, they_were_asking him to_remain with them, and he_remained there two days.
\v 41 And with_many more believed, because_of the word of_him,
\v 42 to_the and women they_were_saying, We_are_believing no_longer because_of your speech, for we_have_heard ourselves and we_have_known that this is truly the Rx-saviour-Rx of_the world.
\v 43 And after the two days, he_came_out from_there into G‹H‹Galilaia/(Gālīl)›H›G.
\v 44 For himself \nd G‹H‹Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a)›H›G\nd* testified that \add +a\add*_prophet in his own hometown, is_ not _having honor.
\v 45 Therefore When he_came into G‹H‹Galilaia, the G‹Galilaios›G received him, having_seen all \add >things\add* as_much_as he_did in G‹H‹Hierousalēm/(Yərūshālam)›H›G at the feast, for they also came to the feast.
\v 46 Therefore he_came again to Rx-G‹Kana›G-Rx of_G‹H‹Galilaia, where he_made the water wine. And was \add +a\add*_certain royal \add official\add*, of_whose son was_ailing in G‹Kafarna'oum›G.
\v 47 This \add >one\add* having_heard that \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* is_coming out_of Rx-G‹Youdaia›G-Rx into G‹H‹Galilaia, went_away to him, and was_asking that he_may_come_down, and may_heal the son of_him, for he_was_going to_be_dying_off.
\v 48 Therefore said \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* to him: If you_all_may_ not _see signs and wonders, you_all_may_ by_no_means not _believe.
\v 49 The royal \add official\add* is_saying to him: Sir, come_down before the little_child of_me to_die_off.
\v 50 \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* is_saying to_him: Be_going, the son of_you is_living. The man believed in_the word which \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* said to_him, and he_was_going.
\v 51 And already of_him coming_down, the slaves of_him met with_him and reported saying that the boy of_him is_living.
\v 52 Therefore he_inquired the hour from them in which he_had better. Therefore they_said to_him, Yesterday the fever left him at_\add +the\add*_ seventh _hour.
\v 53 Therefore the father knew that that \add was\add* at_the hour at which \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* said to_him: The son of_you is_living, and himself and the whole house of_him believed.
\v 54 And this \add =is\add* again \add +the\add*_second sign \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* did, having_come out_of Rx-G‹Youdaia›G-Rx into G‹H‹Galilaia.
\c 5
\v 1 After these \add >things\add* there_was \add +a\add*_feast of_the G‹Youdaiōns›G, and \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* went_up to G‹H‹Hierousalēm.
\v 2 And there_is \add +a\add*_pool in G‹H‹Hierousalēm at the sheep_gate, being_called G‹Bēthsaida›G In_G‹Hebraios›G, having five porticos.
\v 3 In these \add +a\add*_multitude of_the \add >ones\add* ailing, blind, lame, paralyzed. was_lying,
\v 4
\v 5 And was \add +a\add*_certain man there, being thirty eight years in the sicknesses of_him.
\v 6 \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* having_seen this \add >one\add* lying_down, and having_known that he_is_ already _having much time, he_is_saying to_him: You_are_wanting healthy to_become. 
\v 7 The \add >one\add* ailing answered to_him: Sir, I_am_ not _having \add +a\add*_person, in_order_that whenever the water may_be_disturbed, he_may_put me into the pool, in but which am_coming I, another before me is_coming_down.
\v 8 \nd G‹H‹Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a)›H›G\nd* is_saying to_him: Be_raising, take_up the pallet of_you, and be_walking.
\v 9 And immediately the man became healthy, and took_up the pallet of_him, and was_walking. And it_was \add +the\add*_sabbath on that day.
\v 10 Therefore the G‹Youdaiōns›G were_saying to_the \add >one\add* having_been_healed: It_is \add +the\add*_sabbath, and it_is_ not _permitting for_you to_take_up the pallet of_you.
\v 11 but \add +the\add*_one answered to_them: The \add >one\add* having_made me healthy, that \add >one\add* said to_me: Take_up the pallet of_you and be_walking.
\v 12 They_asked him: Who is the man having_said to_you: Take_up and be_walking. 
\v 13 But the \add >one\add* having_been_healed not had_known who he_is, for \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* bowed_out, \add +a\add*_crowd being in the place.
\v 14 After these \add >things\add* \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* is_finding him in the temple, and he_said to_him: See you_have_become healthy, be_ no_longer _sinning, in_order_that something worse may_ not _become to_you.
\v 15 The man went_away, and declared to_the G‹Youdaiōns›G that \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* is the \add >one\add* having_made him healthy.
\v 16 And because_of this, the G‹Youdaiōns›G were_persecuting \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd*, because he_was_doing these \add >things\add* on \add +a\add*_sabbath.
\v 17 But he answered to_them: The father of_me is_working until now, and_I am_working.
\v 18 Therefore because_of this, the G‹Youdaiōns›G were_ more _seeking him to_kill_off, because he_was_ not only _breaking the sabbath, but also he_was_calling \nd god\nd* \add ^his\add*_own father , making himself equal to_\nd god\nd*.
\v 19 Therefore \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* answered, and was_saying to_them: Truly, truly, I_am_saying to_you_all, the son is_ not _able to_be_doing nothing of himself, except anything may_be_seeing the father doing, for whatever that \add >one\add* may_be_doing, these \add >things\add* also the son likewise is_doing.
\v 20 For the father is_loving the son, and is_showing all \add >things\add* to_him which himself is_doing, and he_will_be_showing greater \add =than\add* these \add >things\add* works to_him, in_order_that you_all may_be_Rx-marvelling-Rx.
\v 21 For as the father is_raising the dead and is_giving_life, thus also the son, is_giving_life whom is_willing.
\v 22 For and_not the father is_judging no_one, but has_given all judgment to_the son,
\v 23 in_order_that all may_be_honoring the son, as they_are_honoring the father. The \add >one\add* not honoring the son, is_ not _honoring the father, the \add >one\add* having_sent him.
\v 24 Truly, truly, I_am_saying to_you_all that the \add >one\add* hearing the word of_me, and believing in_the \add >one\add* having_sent me, is_having eternal life, and is_ not _coming into judgment, but has_departed out_of death into life.
\v 25 Truly, truly, I_am_saying to_you_all that \add +an\add*_hour is_coming and now is, when the dead will_be_hearing of_the voice of_the son of_\nd god\nd*, and the \add >ones\add* having_heard will_be_living.
\v 26 For as the father is_having life in himself, thus also he_gave life to_the son to_be_having in himself, 
\v 27 and he_gave authority to_him to_be_executing judgment, because he_is \add +the\add*_son of_Man.
\v 28 Be_ not _Rx-marvelling-Rx at_this, because \add +an\add*_hour is_coming in which all the \add >ones\add* in the tombs will_be_hearing of_the voice of_him,
\v 29 and the \add >ones\add* having_practiced the good \add >things\add* they_will_be_going_out, to \add +the\add*_resurrection of_life, and the \add >ones\add* the having_done evil \add >things\add*, to \add +the\add*_resurrection of_judgment.
\v 30 I am_ not _being_able to_be_doing nothing of myself, as I_am_hearing, I_am_judging, and my judgment is righteous, because I_am_ not _seeking my will, but the will of_the \add >one\add* having_sent me.
\v 31 If I may_be_testifying concerning myself, the testimony of_me is not true.
\v 32 Another is the \add >one\add* testifying concerning me, and I_have_known that the testimony which he_is_testifying concerning me is true.
\v 33 You_all have_sent_out to G‹Yōannēs›G, and he_has_testified to_the truth.
\v 34 But I am_ not _receiving the testimony from human_origin, but these \add >things\add* I_am_saying, in_order_that you_all may_be_saved.
\v 35 That \add >one\add* was the lamp being_burned and shining, and you_all willed to_be_exulted for \add +a\add*_hour in the light of_him.
\v 36 But I am_having the testimony greater \add =than\add* G‹Yōannēs›G, for the works that the father has_given to_me, in_order_that I_may_complete them, the same works which I_am_doing, is_testifying concerning me that the father has_sent_ me _out.
\v 37 And the father having_sent me, that \add >one\add* has_testified concerning me. You_all_have_ neither _heard \add +the\add*_voice of_him ever, nor have_you_all_seen appearance of_him.
\v 38 And you_all_are_ not _having the word of_him remaining in you_all, because you_all are_ not _believing in_this \add >one\add* that \add >one\add* whom he_sent_out.
\v 39 You_all_are_searching the scriptures, because you_all are_supposing to_be_having eternal life in them, and those are the \add >ones\add* testifying concerning me, 
\v 40 and you_all_are_ not _willing to_come to me, in_order_that you_all_may_be_having life.
\v 41 I_am_ not _receiving glory from humans,
\v 42 but I_have_known that you_all you_all_are_ not _having the love of_\nd god\nd* in yourselves.
\v 43 I have_come in the name of_the father of_me, and you_all_are_ not _receiving me, if another may_come in his own name, you_all_will_be_receiving that \add >one\add*.
\v 44 How are_ you_all _being_able to_believe, receiving glory from one_another, and you_all_are_ not _seeking the glory which \add =is\add* from the only. 
\v 45 Not be_supposing that I will_be_accusing against_you_all before the father. the \add >one\add* accusing against_you_all Is G‹H‹Mōsēs/(Mosheh)›H›G, in whom you_all have_hoped.
\v 46 For if you_all_were_believing in_G‹H‹Mōsēs, you_all_were_believing in_me, for that \add >one\add* wrote concerning me.
\v 47 But if you_all_are_ not _believing in_the writings of_that \add >one\add*, how will_you_all_be_believing in_my words. 
\c 6
\v 1 After these \add >things\add*, \nd G‹H‹Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a)›H›G\nd* went_away across the sea of_G‹H‹Galilaia/(Gālīl)›H›G of_G‹Tiberios›G.
\v 2 And \add +a\add*_ great _crowd was_following after_him, because they_were_observing the signs which he_was_doing with the \add >ones\add* ailing.
\v 3 And \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* went_up into the mountain, and he_was_sitting there with the apprentices/followers of_him.
\v 4 And the passover_\add feast\add* was near, the feast of_the G‹Youdaiōns›G.
\v 5 Therefore \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* having_lifted_up his eyes, and having_seen that \add +a\add*_great crowd is_coming to him, he_is_saying to Rx-G‹Filippos›G-Rx: From_where may_we_buy loaves, in_order_that may_eat these. 
\v 6 for he_was_saying this testing him, And he had_known what he_was_going to_be_doing.
\v 7 Rx-G‹Filippos›G-Rx answered to_him: For_two_hundred G‹dēnarion_\add coins\add*›G are_ not _sufficing loaves for_them, that each may_receive little \add >thing\add*.
\v 8 one of the apprentices/followers of_him, G‹Andreas›G the brother of_Rx-G‹Simōn›G-Rx G‹Petros›G Is_saying to_him,
\v 9 Here is \add +a\add*_little_boy, who is_having five loaves of_barley and two fish, but what is these for so_many. 
\v 10 \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* Said: Make the people to_sit_down. And there_was grass much in the place. Therefore the men sat_down, the number about five_thousand.
\v 11 therefore \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* Took the loaves, and having_given_thanks, he_distributed to_the \add >ones\add* reclining, likewise also of the fish, as_much_as they_were_wanting.
\v 12 And when they_were_filled, he_is_saying to_the apprentices/followers of_him: Gather_together the fragments being_leftover, in_order_that not anything may_lose.
\v 13 Therefore they_gathered_together and they_filled twelve baskets of_fragments from the five barley loaves, which they_were_leftover to_the \add >ones\add* having_eaten.
\v 14 Therefore the people having_seen what signs he_did were_saying, This is truly the prophet who coming into the world.
\v 15 Therefore \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* having_known that they_are_going to_be_coming and to_be_snatching him, in_order_that they_may_make \add ~him\add* king, he_ himself only _withdrew again to the mountain.
\v 16 And when it_became evening, the apprentices/followers of_him came_down to the sea,
\v 17 and having_boarded into \add +the\add*_boat, they_were_coming across the sea to G‹Kafarna'oum›G. And darkness already had_become, and \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* had_ not_yet _come to them.
\v 18 And the sea was_being_awoke by_\add +a\add*_ great _wind blowing.
\v 19 Therefore having_rowed about twenty five or thirty G‹stadion_\add measure\add*›Gs, they_are_observing \nd G‹H‹Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a)›H›G\nd* walking on the sea, and becoming near the boat, and they_were_afraid.
\v 20 But he is_saying to_them: I am \add he\add*, be_ not _fearing.
\v 21 Therefore they_were_willing to_receive him into the boat, and immediately the boat became at the land to which they_were_going.
\v 22 On_the_ of_next _\add day\add* the crowd having_stood across of_the sea, saw that no other little_boat was there except one, and that \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* not entered_with with_the apprentices/followers of_him into the boat, but only the apprentices/followers of_him went_away, 
\v 23 other boats came from G‹Tiberios›G, near the place where they_ate the bread, having_ \nd master\nd* the _given_thanks.
\v 24 Therefore when the crowd saw that \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* is not there, nor the apprentices/followers of_him, they boarded into the little_boats, and they_came to G‹Kafarna'oum›G seeking \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd*.
\v 25 And having_found him across of_the sea, they_said to_him: , My_great_\add >one\add*, when have_you_become here. 
\v 26 \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* answered to_them and said: Truly, truly, I_am_saying to_you_all, you_all_are_seeking me, not because you_all_saw signs, but because you_all_ate of the loaves and were_satisfied.
\v 27 Be_ not _working for_the perishing food, but the food remaining to eternal life, which the son of_Man will_be_giving to_you_all, for \nd god\nd* the father sealed this \add >one\add*.
\v 28 Therefore they_said to him: What may_we_be_doing, in_order_that we_may_be_doing the works of_\nd god\nd*. 
\v 29 \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* Answered and said to_them: This is the work of_\nd god\nd*, that you_all_may_be_believing in whom that \add >one\add* sent_out.
\v 30 Therefore they_said to_him: Therefore what sign are_doing you, in_order_that we_may_see and we_may_believe in_you. What are_you_doing. 
\v 31 The fathers of_us ate the manna in the desert, as is having_been_written: he_gave bread out_of heaven to_them to_eat.
\v 32 Therefore \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* said to_them: Truly, truly, I_am_saying to_you_all, G‹H‹Mōsēs/(Mosheh)›H›G has_ not _given to_you_all the bread out_of heaven, but the father of_me is_giving to_you_all the true bread out_of heaven.
\v 33 For the bread of_\nd god\nd* is the \add >one\add* coming_down out_of heaven, and giving life to_the world.
\v 34 Therefore they_said to him: Sir, always give this bread to_us.
\v 35 \nd G‹H‹Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a)›H›G\nd* said to_them: I am the bread of_life, the \add >one\add* coming to me, by_no_means may_ not _hunger, and the \add >one\add* believing in me, by_no_means will_ not ever _be_thirsting.
\v 36 But I_said to_you_all that you_all_ both _have_seen me and you_all_are_ not _believing.
\v 37 Everyone that the father is_giving to_me, will_be_coming to me, and the \add >one\add* coming to me, by_no_means I_may_ not _throw_out out.
\v 38 Because I_have_came_down from heaven, not in_order_that I_may_be_doing my will, but the will of_the \add >one\add* having_sent me.
\v 39 And this is the will of_the \add >one\add* having_sent me, that everything which he_has_given to_me, I_may_ not _lose of it, but I_will_be_raising_ it _up on_the last day.
\v 40 For this is the will of_the father of_me, that everyone observing the son and believing in him, may_be_having eternal life, and I will_be_raising_ him _up on_the last day.
\v 41 therefore the G‹Youdaiōns›G /Were/_grumbling about him, because he_said: I am the bread the \add >one\add* having_come_down out_of heaven.
\v 42 And they_were_saying, is this Not \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* the son of_G‹H‹Yōsēf/(Yōşēf)›H›G, of_whose father and mother we have_known. How now is_he_saying, I_have_came_down out_of heaven. 
\v 43 \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* Answered and said to_them: Be_ not _grumbling with one_another.
\v 44 No_one is_able to_come to me, if not the father, the \add >one\add* having_sent me, may_draw him, and_I will_be_raising_ him _up the last day.
\v 45 It_is having_been_written in the prophets: and they_will_ all _be taught of_\nd god\nd*. Everyone having_heard from the father and having_learned, is_coming to me.
\v 46 Not that anyone has_seen the father, except the \add >one\add* being from \nd god\nd*, this \add >one\add* has_seen the father.
\v 47 Truly, truly, I_am_saying to_you_all, the \add >one\add* believing is_having eternal life.
\v 48 I am the bread of_life.
\v 49 The fathers of_you_all ate the manna in the desert, and they_died_off.
\v 50 This is the bread coming_down out_of heaven, in_order_that anyone may_eat of it, and may_ not _die_off.
\v 51 I am the living bread having_come_down out_of heaven, if anyone may_eat of this bread, he_will_be_living to the age. The even and bread that I will_be_giving, is the flesh of_me. for the life of_the world.
\v 52 Therefore the G‹Youdaiōns›G were_quarrelling with one_another saying: How is_ this \add >one\add* _able to_give to_us the flesh of_him to_eat. 
\v 53 Therefore \nd G‹H‹Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a)›H›G\nd* said to_them: Truly, truly, I_am_saying to_you_all, if not you_all_may_eat the flesh of_the son of_Man, and you_all_may_drink of_him the blood, you_all_are_ not _having life in yourselves.
\v 54 The \add >one\add* eating the flesh of_me, and drinking the blood of_me, is_having eternal life, and_I will_be_raising_up him at_the last day.
\v 55 For the flesh of_me is true food, and the blood of_me is true drink.
\v 56 The \add >one\add* eating the flesh of_me, and drinking the blood of_me, is_remaining in me, and_I in him.
\v 57 As the living father sent_ me _out, and_I am_living because_of the father, also the \add >one\add* eating me, and_that \add >one\add* will_be_living because_of me.
\v 58 This is the bread having_come_down from heaven, not as the fathers ate and they_died_off, the \add >one\add* eating this bread will_be_living to the age.
\v 59 He_said these \add >things\add* in \add +the\add*_synagogue, teaching in G‹Kafarna'oum›G.
\v 60 Therefore many of the apprentices/followers having_heard of_him said, this word is hard, who is_able to_be_hearing of_it. 
\v 61 But \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* having_known in himself that the apprentices/followers of_him are_grumbling about this, he_said to_them: This is_offending you_all. 
\v 62 Therefore if you_all_may_be_observing the son of_Man, going_up where he_was earlier. 
\v 63 The \nd spirit\nd* is giving_life, the flesh is_ not _benefiting nothing. The words which I have_spoken to_you_all is spirit and is life.
\v 64 But there_are some of you_all who are_ not _believing. For \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* had_known from \add +the\add*_beginning, who_all are the \add >ones\add* not believing, and who is the \add >one\add* going_to_give_ him _over.
\v 65 And he_was_saying: Because_of this I_have_said to_you_all that no_one is_able to_come to me, if may_be having_ not _been_given to_him from the father.
\v 66 From this many out_of of_the apprentices/followers of_him went_away to the \add >things\add* back, and no_longer were_walking with him.
\v 67 Therefore \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* said to_the twelve: You_all also are_ not _wanting to_be_going_away. 
\v 68 Rx-G‹Simōn›G-Rx G‹Petros›G answered to_him: \nd master\nd*, to whom will_we_be_going_away. You_are_having \add +the\add*_words eternal of_life.
\v 69 And we have_believed and we_have_known that you are the holy \add Rx-one-Rx\add* of_\nd god\nd*.
\v 70 \nd G‹H‹Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a)›H›G\nd* answered to_them: Not I chose you_all the twelve, and one of you_all is \add +a\add*_devil. 
\v 71 And he_was_speaking to_G‹H‹Youdas/(Yəhūdāh)›H›G of_Rx-G‹Simōn›G-Rx of_G‹Iskariōtēs›G, for this \add >one\add* one of the twelve was_going to_be_giving_ him _over.

\v 1 And after these \add >things\add*, \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* was_walking in G‹H‹Galilaia/(Gālīl)›H›G, for he_was_ not _wanting to_be_walking in Rx-G‹Youdaia›G-Rx, because the G‹Youdaiōns›G were_seeking to_kill_ him _off.
\v 2 And it_was near the feast of_the G‹Youdaiōns›G the tents.
\v 3 Therefore the brothers of_him said to him: Depart from_here, and be_going into Rx-G‹Youdaia›G-Rx, in_order_that also the apprentices/followers of_you will_be_observing of_you the works that you_are_doing.
\v 4 For no_one is_doing anything in secret and is_seeking himself to_be in public. If you_are_doing these \add >things\add*, reveal yourself to_the world.
\v 5 For not_even the brothers of_him were_believing in him.
\v 6 Therefore \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* is_saying to_them: my time is_ not_yet _coming, but your time always is ready.
\v 7 The world is_ not _able to_be_hating you_all, but it_is_hating me, because I am_testifying concerning it that the works of_it is evil.
\v 8 You_all go_up to the feast, I not_yet am_going_up to this feast, because my time has_ not_yet _been_fulfilled.
\v 9 And having_said these \add >things\add* to_them he_remained in G‹H‹Galilaia.
\v 10 But when the brothers of_him went_up to the feast, then he also went_up, not openly, but as in secret.
\v 11 Therefore the G‹Youdaiōns›G were_seeking him at the feast, and they_were_saying: Where is that \add >one\add*. 
\v 12 And there_was much grumbling concerning him among the crowds. The \add >ones\add* on_one_hand were_saying, He_is good, on_the_other_hand others were_saying: No, but he_is_deceiving the crowd.
\v 13 No_one however was_speaking in_public concerning him, because_of the fear of_the G‹Youdaiōns›G.
\v 14 But now being_middle of_the feast, \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* went_up into the temple and was_teaching.
\v 15 Therefore the G‹Youdaiōns›G were_Rx-marvelling-Rx saying: How has_ this \add >one\add* _known letters, not having_learned. 
\v 16 Therefore \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* answered to_them and said: my teaching not is mine, but of_the \add >one\add* having_sent me.
\v 17 If anyone may_be_wanting to_be_practicing the will of_him, he_will_be_knowing concerning the teaching, whether it_is from \nd god\nd*, or I am_speaking from myself.
\v 18 The \add >one\add* speaking from himself, is_seeking the his own glory, but the \add >one\add* seeking the glory of_the \add >one\add* having_sent him, this \add >one\add* is true, and unrighteousness is not in him.
\v 19 has_ not G‹H‹Mōsēs/(Mosheh)›H›G _given to_you_all the law, and no_one of you_all is_practicing the law. Why you_all_are_seeking to_kill_ me _off. 
\v 20 The crowd answered: You_are_having \add +a\add*_demon, who is_seeking to_kill_ you _off. 
\v 21 \nd G‹H‹Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a)›H›G\nd* answered and said to_them: I_did one work and you_all_ all _are_Rx-marvelling-Rx.
\v 22 Because_of this G‹H‹Mōsēs has_given to_you_all circumcision (not that is of G‹H‹Mōsēs, but of the fathers), and on \add +the\add*_sabbath you_all_are_circumcising \add +a\add*_man.
\v 23 If \add +a\add*_man is_receiving circumcision on \add +the\add*_sabbath, in_order_that the law of_G‹H‹Mōsēs may_ not _be_broken, you_all_are_angry with_me because I_made \add +a\add*_man whole healthy on \add +the\add*_sabbath. 
\v 24 Be_ not _judging according_to appearance, but be_judging righteous judgment.
\v 25 Therefore some of of_the G‹H‹\add >ones\add*_from_Hierousalēm/(Yərūshālam)›H›G were_saying: Is not this whom they_are_seeking to_kill_off. 
\v 26 And see, he_is_speaking in_public, and are_saying nothing to_him. Perhaps the rulers knew that this truly is the \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd*. 
\v 27 But we_have_known this \add >one\add* from_where he_is. But the \nd chosen_one\nd* whenever he_may_be_coming, no_one is_knowing from_where he_is.
\v 28 Therefore \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* cried_out in the temple teaching, and saying: You_all_have_known also_me, and you_all_have_known from_where I_am, and I_have_ not _come of myself, but the \add >one\add* having_sent me is true, whom you_all have_ not _known.
\v 29 I have_known him, because I_am from him, and_that \add >one\add* sent_ me _out.
\v 30 Therefore they_were_seeking to_arrest him, but no_one laid_on his hand on him, because the hour of_him had_ not_yet _come.
\v 31 The but many of crowd believed in him, and they_were_saying: Whenever the \nd chosen_one\nd*, may_come, will_ not _be_doing more signs \add =than\add* which this \add man\add* did. 
\v 32 the G‹Farisaios_\add sect\add*›G heard of_the crowd grumbling concerning him these \add >things\add*, and sent_out the chief_priests and the G‹Farisaios_\add sect\add*›G attendants, in_order_that they_may_arrest him.
\v 33 Therefore \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* said: I_am still \add +a\add*_little time with you_all, and I_am_going to the \add >one\add* having_sent me.
\v 34 You_all_will_be_seeking me, and you_all will_ not _be_finding, me and where am I you_all, are_ not _being_able to_come.
\v 35 Therefore the G‹Youdaiōns›G said to themselves: Where is_ this \add >one\add* _going to_be_going, that we will_ not _be_finding him. He_is_ not _going to_be_going to the dispersion of_the G‹Hellēns›G, and to_be_teaching the G‹Hellēns›G. 
\v 36 What is this word that he_said: You_all_will_be_seeking me, and you_all will_ not _be_finding, me and where am I, you_all are_ not _being_able to_come. 
\v 37 And at the great last day of_the feast \nd G‹H‹Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a)›H›G\nd* had_stood, and cried_out saying: If anyone may_be_thirsting, let_him_be_coming to me and let_him_be_drinking.
\v 38 The \add >one\add* believing in me, as the scripture said: Rivers of_ living _water will_be_flowing out_of the belly of_him.
\v 39 But he_said this concerning the \nd spirit\nd*, of_whom they_were_going to_be_receiving, the \add >ones\add* having_believed on him, for \add +the\add*_\nd spirit\nd* was not_yet, because \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* was_glorified not_yet.
\v 40 Therefore the Of crowd, having_heard of_ these _words, they_were_saying: This is truly the prophet.
\v 41 Others were_saying: This is the \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd*. But they were_saying: For the \nd chosen_one\nd* is_ not _coming out_of G‹H‹Galilaia/(Gālīl)›H›G. 
\v 42 Not the scripture said that the \nd chosen_one\nd* is_coming out_of the seed of_G‹H‹Dauid/(Dāvid)›H›G, and from G‹Bēthle'em›G, the village where G‹H‹Dauid was. 
\v 43 Therefore \add +a\add*_division became in the crowd because_of him.
\v 44 And some of them were_wanting to_arrest him, but no_one laid their hands on him.
\v 45 Therefore the attendants came to the chief_priests and G‹Farisaios_\add sect\add*›G, and those said to_them: For_reason why you_all_ not _brought him. 
\v 46 the attendants answered: \add +A\add*_person never spoke thus.
\v 47 Therefore the G‹Farisaios_\add sect\add*›G answered to_them: Not you_all have_been_deceived also. 
\v 48 Not anyone of the rulers believed in him, or of the G‹Farisaios_\add sect\add*›G. 
\v 49 But this crowd, not knowing the law, are accursed.
\v 50 G‹Nikodēmos›G the \add >one\add* having_come to him earlier, being one of them Is_saying, to them,
\v 51 Not the law of_us is_judging the person, if not first may_hear from him, and may_know what he_is_doing. 
\v 52 They_answered and said to_him: Are not you from G‹H‹Galilaia also. Search and see that \add +a\add*_prophet is_ not _being_raised out_of G‹H‹Galilaia.

\v 12 Therefore \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* spoke to_them again saying: I am the light of_the world, the \add >one\add* following me by_no_means may_ not _walk in the darkness, but will_be_having the light of_life.
\v 13 Therefore the G‹Farisaios_\add sect\add*›G said to_him: You are_testifying about yourself, the testimony of_you is not true.
\v 14 \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* answered, and said to_them: Even_if I may_be_testifying about myself, the testimony of_me, is true, because I_have_known from_where I_came and where I_am_going. But you_all have_ not _known from_where I_am_coming or where I_am_going.
\v 15 You_all are_judging according_to the flesh, I am_ not _judging no_one.
\v 16 but Even if I I_may_be_judging, my judgment is true, because I_am not \add +the\add*_only \add >one\add*, but I and the father having_sent me.
\v 17 The also has_been_written in and your law, that the testimony of_two men is true.
\v 18 I am the \add >one\add* testifying about myself, and the father having_sent me is_testifying about me.
\v 19 Therefore they_were_saying to_him: Where is the father of_you. \nd G‹H‹Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a)›H›G\nd* answered: You_all_have_known neither me, nor the father of_me. If you_all_had_known me, you_all_ would _had_known also the father of_me.
\v 20 He_spoke these words in the treasury, teaching in the temple, and no_one arrested him, because the hour of_him had_ not_yet _come.
\v 21 Therefore he_said again to_them: I am_going_away and you_all_will_be_seeking me, and you_all_will_be_dying_off in the sin of_you_all, you_all are_ not _being_able to_come where I am_going.
\v 22 Therefore were_saying the G‹Youdaiōns›G: Surely_not he_will_be_killing_off himself, that he_is_saying: Where I am_going you_all, not are_being_able to_come. 
\v 23 And he_was_saying to_them: You_all are from the \add >things\add* below, I am from the \add >things\add* above, you_all are of this world, I am not of this world.
\v 24 Therefore I_said to_you_all that you_all_will_be_dying_off in the sins of_you_all, for if you_all_may_ not _believe that I am \add he\add*, you_all_will_be_dying_off in the sins of_you_all.
\v 25 Therefore they_were_saying to_him: Who are you. \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* said to_them: From_the beginning what something I_am_speaking also to_you_all. 
\v 26 I_am_having to_be_speaking And to_be_judging many \add >things\add* concerning you_all, but the \add >one\add* having_sent me is true, and_ what _I heard from him, I_am_speaking these \add >things\add* to the world.
\v 27 They_ not _knew that he_was_speaking to_them about_the father.
\v 28 Therefore \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* said to_them, Whenever you_all_may_exalt the son of_Man, then you_all_will_be_knowing that I am \add he\add*, and I_am_doing nothing from myself, but as the father taught me, I_am_speaking these \add >things\add*.
\v 29 And the \add >one\add* having_sent me, is with me, , he_ not _left me alone, because I am_ always _doing the \add >things\add* pleasing to_him.
\v 30 Speaking of_him these \add >things\add*, many believed on him.
\v 31 Therefore \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* was_saying to the G‹Youdaiōns›G having_believed in_him: If you_all may_remain in my word, you_all_are truly apprentices/followers of_me.
\v 32 And you_all_will_be_knowing the truth, and the truth will_be_freeing you_all.
\v 33 They_answered to him: We_are seed of_G‹H‹Abra'am/('Avərāhām)›H›G, and we_have_served to_no_one ever, how are_ you _saying, You_all_will_be_becoming free. 
\v 34 \nd G‹H‹Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a)›H›G\nd* answered to_them: Truly, truly, I_am_saying to_you_all that everyone practicing sin, is \add +a\add*_slave of_sin.
\v 35 And the slave is_ not _remaining in the house to the age, the son is_remaining to the age.
\v 36 Therefore if the son may_free you_all, you_all_will_be really free.
\v 37 I_have_known that you_all_are seed of_G‹H‹Abra'am, but you_all_are_seeking to_kill_ me _off, because my word is_ not _having_room in you_all.
\v 38 I_am_speaking what I have_seen with the father, therefore also you_all you_all_are_doing what you_all_heard with your father.
\v 39 They_answered and said to_him: The father of_us is G‹H‹Abra'am. \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* is_saying to_them: If you_all_are children of_G‹H‹Abra'am, you_all_were_doing the works of_G‹H‹Abra'am.
\v 40 But now you_all_are_seeking to_kill_ me _off, \add +a\add*_man who I_have_spoken the truth to_you_all, that I_heard from \nd god\nd*, this G‹H‹Abra'am did not.
\v 41 You_all are_doing the works of_the father of_you_all. therefore they_said to_him: We have_ not _been_born of sexual_immorality, we_are_having one father, \nd god\nd*.
\v 42 \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* said to_them: If \nd god\nd* was \add +the\add*_father of_you_all, you_all_ would _were_loving me, for I came_out from \nd god\nd* and am_coming, for and_not I_have_come of myself, but that \add >one\add* sent_ me _out.
\v 43 for_ Why _reason you_all_are_ not _knowing my speech. Because you_all_are_ not _being_able to_be_hearing my word.
\v 44 You_all are of the father the devil, and you_all_are_wanting to_be_doing the desires of_the father of_you_all. That \add >one\add* was \add +a\add*_murderer from \add +the\add*_beginning, and was_ not _standing in the truth, because truth is not in him. Whenever he_may_be_speaking falsehood, he_is_speaking from his own, because he_is \add +a\add*_liar, and the father of_it.
\v 45 But I because I_am_speaking the truth, you_all_are_ not _believing in_me. 
\v 46 Which of you_all is_rebuking me concerning sin. If I_am_speaking \add +the\add*_truth, for_ why _reason you_all are_ not _believing in_me. 
\v 47 The \add >one\add* being of \nd god\nd*, is_hearing the words of_\nd god\nd*, because_of this you_all are_ not _hearing, because you_all_are not of \nd god\nd*.
\v 48 The G‹Youdaiōns›G answered and said to_him, are_ we not rightly _saying that you are \add +a\add*_Rx-G‹H‹from_Samareia/(Shomərōn)›H›G-Rx, and you_are_having \add +a\add*_demon. 
\v 49 \nd G‹H‹Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a)›H›G\nd* answered: I am_ not _having \add +a\add*_demon, but I_am_honoring the father of_me, and you_all are_dishonoring me.
\v 50 But I am_ not _seeking the glory of_me, he_is the \add >one\add* seeking and judging.
\v 51 Truly, truly, I_am_saying to_you_all, if anyone may_keep my word, by_no_means he_may_ not _observe death to the age.
\v 52 The G‹Youdaiōns›G said to_him: Now we_have_known that you_are_having \add +a\add*_demon. G‹H‹Abra'am/('Avərāhām)›H›G died_off and the prophets, and you are_saying: If anyone may_keep the word of_me, by_no_means he_may_ not _taste of_death to the age.
\v 53 You are not greater \add =than\add* G‹H‹Abra'am the father of_us, who died_off. Also the prophets died_off. Whom you_are_making yourself. 
\v 54 \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* answered: If I may_glorify myself, the glory of_me is nothing, the father of_me is the \add >one\add* glorifying me, of_whom you_all are_saying, He_is \nd god\nd* of_us,
\v 55 and you_all_have_ not _known him, but I have_known him, and_if I_may_say that I_have_ not _known him, I_will_be \add +a\add*_liar similar to_you_all. But I_have_known him, and I_am_keeping the word of_him.
\v 56 G‹H‹Abra'am the father of_you_all exulted, that he_may_see my day, and he_saw \add it\add* and was_elated.
\v 57 Therefore the G‹Youdaiōns›G said to him, you_are_ not_yet _having fifty years, and you_have_seen. G‹H‹Abra'am
\v 58 \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* said to_them: Truly, truly, I_am_saying to_you_all, before G‹H‹Abra'am to_become, I am.
\v 59 Therefore they_took_up stones, in_order_that they_may_throw at him, But \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* was_hidden, and came_out out_of the temple.
\c 9
\v 1 And passing_by, he_saw \add +a\add*_man blind from birth.
\v 2 And the apprentices/followers of_him asked him saying: , My_great_\add >one\add*, who sinned, this \add man\add* or the parents of_him, in_order_that he_may_be_born blind. 
\v 3 \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* answered: Neither this \add man\add* sinned, nor the parents of_him, but in_order_that the works of_\nd god\nd* may_be_revealed in him.
\v 4 it_is_fitting Us to_be_working the works of_the \add >one\add* having_sent us, until it_is day, night is_coming, when no_one is_able to_be_working.
\v 5 Whenever I_may_be in the world, I_am \add +the\add*_light of_the world.
\v 6 Having_said these \add >things\add*, he_spat on_the_ground and made clay of the spittle, and he_spread_on the clay of_him to his eyes.
\v 7 And he_said to_him: Be_going, wash in the pool of_G‹Silōam›G (which is_being_translated: having_been_sent_out). Therefore he_went_away and washed, and came seeing.
\v 8 Therefore the neighbors and the \add >ones\add* observing him earlier, that he_was \add +a\add*_beggar, were_saying: Is this not the \add >one\add* sitting and begging. 
\v 9 Others were_saying, This he_is, others were_saying: No, but he_is similar to_him. That \add >one\add* was_saying, I am \add he\add*.
\v 10 Therefore they_were_saying to_him: How were_ the eyes of_you _opened_up. 
\v 11 That \add >one\add* answered, man being_called \nd G‹H‹Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a)›H›G\nd* made clay, and spread_on the eyes of_me, and said to_me, Be_going to G‹Silōam›G and wash. Having_gone_away therefore and having_washed, I_received_sight.
\v 12 And they_said to_him: Where is that \add >one\add*. He_is_saying: I_have_ not _known.
\v 13 They_are_bringing him to the G‹Farisaios_\add sect\add*›G, the once blind \add man\add*.
\v 14 And it_was \add +the\add*_sabbath in which day \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* made the clay, and opened_up the eyes of_him.
\v 15 Therefore again the G‹Farisaios_\add sect\add*›G they_were_asking him also how he_received_sight. And he said to_them: He_put_on clay on the eyes of_me, and I_washed, and I_am_seeing.
\v 16 Therefore some of the G‹Farisaios_\add sect\add*›G were_saying, this \add >one\add* man is not from \nd god\nd*, because he_is_ not _keeping the sabbath. Others were_saying: How is_ sinful \add +a\add*_man _able to_be_doing such signs. And was \add +a\add*_division among them.
\v 17 Therefore they_are_saying again to_the blind \add man\add*: What are_ you _saying about him, because he_opened_up the eyes of_you. And he said, He_is \add +a\add*_prophet.
\v 18 Therefore the G‹Youdaiōns›G not believed him concerning that he_was blind and received_sight, until they_called the parents of_him of_which having_received_sight.
\v 19 And they_asked them saying: This is the son of_you_all, whom you_all are_saying that he_was_born blind. Therefore how he_is_seeing now. 
\v 20 Therefore the parents of_him answered and said: We_have_known that this is the son of_us, and that he_was_born blind.
\v 21 But how he_is_seeing now, we_have_ not _known, or who opened_up the eyes of_him, we have_ not _known, ask him, he he_is_having age, he will_be_speaking about himself.
\v 22 The Parents of_him said these \add >things\add*, because they_were_fearing the G‹Youdaiōns›G, for already the G‹Youdaiōns›G had_decided that if anyone may_confess him \add +the\add*_\nd chosen_one/messiah\nd*, he_may_become excommunicated.
\v 23 Because_of this the parents of_him said, Is_having age, ask. him.
\v 24 Therefore they_called the man who was blind out_of \add +a\add*_second \add time\add*, and they_said to_him: Give glory to_\nd god\nd*, we have_known that this man is \add +a\add*_sinner.
\v 25 Therefore that \add >one\add* answered: Whether is \add +a\add*_sinner I_have_ not _known. Rx-one-Rx \add >thing\add* I_have_known, that being blind, now I_am_seeing.
\v 26 Therefore they_said to_him: What he_did to_you. How he_opened_up the eyes of_you. 
\v 27 He_answered to_them: I_told to_you_all already, and you_all_ not _heard. Why again are_you_all_wanting to_be_hearing. are_ you_all not _wanting also to_become apprentices/followers of_him. 
\v 28 And they_insulted him, and said: You are \add +a\add*_apprentice/follower, of_that \add >one\add*, but we are apprentices/followers of_G‹H‹Mōsēs/(Mosheh)›H›G.
\v 29 We have_known that \nd god\nd* has_spoken to_G‹H‹Mōsēs, but we_have_ not _known this \add man\add* from_where he_is.
\v 30 the man answered and said to_them, for in this is \add +a\add*_Rx-marvellous-Rx \add >thing\add*, that you_all have_ not _known from_where he_is, and_yet he_opened_up the eyes of_me.
\v 31 We_have_known that \nd god\nd* is_ not _hearing from_sinners, but if any may_be god-fearing, and may_be_doing the will of_him, he_is_hearing from_this \add >one\add*.
\v 32 Out_of the age it_was_ not _heard that anyone opened_up \add +the\add*_eyes of_ having_been_born _blind.
\v 33 Except this \add man\add* was from \nd god\nd*, he_was_ not _able to_be_doing nothing.
\v 34 They_answered and said to_him: You were_born wholly in sins, and you are_teaching us. And they_throw_out him out.
\v 35 \nd G‹H‹Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a)›H›G\nd* heard that they_throw_out him out, and having_found him said: Are_ you _believing in the son of_Man. 
\v 36 That \add >one\add* answered: And he_was_saying who is_he, sir, in_order_that I_may_believe in him. 
\v 37 \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* Said to_him: You_have_ both _seen him, and the \add >one\add* speaking with you is that \add >one\add*.
\v 38 And he was_saying: I_am_believing, \nd master\nd*, and he_worshipped before_him.
\v 39 And \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* said, I came into this world for judgment, in_order_that the \add >ones\add* not seeing, may_be_seeing, and the \add >ones\add* seeing, may_become blind.
\v 40 The G‹Farisaios_\add sect\add*›G heard of these \add >things\add* the \add >ones\add* being with him, and they_said to_him: Also are we not blind. 
\v 41 \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* said to_them: If you_all_were blind, you_all_were_ not _having sin, but now you_all_are_saying, We_are_seeing, the sin of_you_all is_remaining.
\c 10
\v 1 Truly, truly, I_am_saying to_you_all, the \add >one\add* not coming_in by the door, to the field of_the sheep, but going_up another_way, that \add >one\add* is \add +a\add*_thief and \add +a\add*_robber.
\v 2 But the \add >one\add* coming_in by the door, is shepherd of_the sheep.
\v 3 To_this \add >one\add* the doorkeeper is_opening_up, and the sheep is_hearing of_the voice of_him, and he_is_calling his own sheep by name, and is_leading_ them _out.
\v 4 Whenever he_may_send_forth all his own, he_is_going before them, and the sheep is_following after_him, because they_have_known the voice of_him.
\v 5 And by_no_means they_may_ not _follow after_\add +a\add*_stranger, but they_will_be_fleeing from him, because they_have_ not _known the voice of_strangers.
\v 6 \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* spoke this allegory to_them, but those not knew what_all it_was, which he_was_speaking to_them.
\v 7 Therefore \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* said to_them again: Truly, truly, I_am_saying to_you_all that I am the door of_the sheep.
\v 8 All as_much_as came before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep not heard from_them.
\v 9 I am the door, if anyone may_come_in by me he_will_be_being_saved, and will_be_coming_in, and will_be_coming_out, and will_be_finding pasture.
\v 10 The thief is_ not _coming, except in_order_that he_may_steal, and may_sacrifice, and may_destroy. I came, in_order_that they_may_be_having life, and they_may_be_having \add it\add* abundantly.
\v 11 I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd is_laying the life of_him for the sheep.
\v 12 The hired_hand even not being \add +the\add*_shepherd, of_whose sheep is not his own, is_observing the wolf coming, and is_leaving the sheep and is_fleeing, and the wolf is_snatching and is_scattering them,
\v 13 because he_is \add +a\add*_hired_hand and is_ not _caring to_him about the sheep.
\v 14 I am the good shepherd, and I_am_knowing mine, and mine are_knowing me .
\v 15 As the father is_knowing me, and_I am_knowing the father, and I_am_giving the life of_me for the sheep.
\v 16 And I_am_having other sheep, which is not of this field, it_is_fitting me to_bring also_those, and they_will_be_hearing of_the voice of_me, and they_will_be_becoming one flock with_one, shepherd.
\v 17 Because_of this, the father is_loving me, because I am_laying the life of_me, in_order_that again I_may_take it.
\v 18 No_one took_up it from me, but I am_laying it of myself. I_am_having authority to_lay it, and I_am_having authority again to_take it. I_received this commandment from the father of_me.
\v 19 \add +A\add*_division again became among the G‹Youdaiōns›G, because_of these words.
\v 20 and many of them were_saying: He_is_having \add +a\add*_demon, and he_is_raving_mad, why are_you_all_hearing from_him. 
\v 21 Others were_saying: These sayings is not of_being_demon_possessed \add >one\add*. \add +A\add*_demon is_ not _able to_open_up \add +the\add*_eyes of_\add +the\add*_blind. 
\v 22 Then the feast_of_dedication became at G‹H‹Hierousalēm/(Yərūshālam)›H›G. It_was winter,
\v 23 and \nd G‹H‹Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a)›H›G\nd* was_walking in the temple, in the portico of_G‹H‹Solomōn/(Shəlmoh)›H›G.
\v 24 Therefore the G‹Youdaiōns›G surrounded him, and they_were_saying to_him: Until when you_are_holding_in_suspense the soul of_us. If you are the \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd*, tell to_us with_plainness.
\v 25 \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* answered to_them: I_told to_you_all and you_all_are_ not _believing. The works that I am_doing in the name of_the father of_me, these \add >things\add* is_testifying concerning me,
\v 26 but you_all are_ not _believing, because you_all_are not of of_my sheep.
\v 27 my sheep are_hearing of_the voice of_me, and_I I_am_knowing them, and they_are_following after_me,
\v 28 and_I am_giving eternal life to_them, and by_no_means they_may_ not _perish, for the age, and anyone will_be_ not _snatching them out_of the hand of_me.
\v 29 The father of_me who has_given \add them\add* to_me, is greater \add =than\add* all, and no_one is_able to_be_snatching out_of the hand of_the father.
\v 30 I and the father one are.
\v 31 The G‹Youdaiōns›G bore again stones, in_order_that they_may_stone him.
\v 32 \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* answered to_them: I_showed many good works to_you_all from the father, of_me because_of which work of_them, are_you_all_stoning me. 
\v 33 The G‹Youdaiōns›G answered to_him: We_are_ not _stoning you for \add +a\add*_good work, but for slander, and because you, \add +a\add*_human being, are_making yourself \nd god\nd*.
\v 34 \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* answered to_them: Is_it not having_been_written in the law of_you_all, I said: You_all_are gods. 
\v 35 If he_called those gods, to whom the word of_\nd god\nd* became (and not is_able to_be_broken the scripture),
\v 36 are_ you_all _saying whom the father sanctified and sent_out into the world, You_are_slandering, because I_said: I_am \add +the\add*_son of_\nd god\nd*. 
\v 37 If I_am_ not _doing the works of_the father of_me, be_ not _believing in_me, 
\v 38 but if I_am_doing, even_if in_me you_all_may_be_ not _believing, be_believing in_the works, in_order_that you_all_may_know and you_all_may_be_knowing that the father in me \add =is\add*, and_I \add =am\add* in the father.
\v 39 Therefore they_were_seeking again to_arrest him, but he_came_out out_of the hand of_them.
\v 40 And he_went_away again beyond the G‹H‹Yordanēs/(Yarəddēn)›H›G, to the place where was G‹Yōannēs›G before immersing, and he_remained there.
\v 41 And many came to him, and they_were_saying, G‹Yōannēs›G on_one_hand did not_one sign, on_the_other_hand all \add >things\add* as_much_as G‹Yōannēs›G said concerning this \add man\add* was true.
\v 42 And many believed in him there.
\c 11
\v 1 And \add +a\add*_certain \add man\add* was ailing, G‹Lazaros›G of G‹Bēthania›G of the village of_G‹H‹Maria/(Mirəyām)›H›G, and G‹Martha›G the sister of_her.
\v 2 And G‹H‹Maria was the \add woman\add* having_anointed the \nd master\nd* with_ointment, and having_wiped_off the feet of_him with_the hairs of_her, whose brother G‹Lazaros›G was_ailing.
\v 3 Therefore the sisters sent_out to him saying: \nd master\nd*, see, he_whom you_are_loving is_ailing.
\v 4 But having_heard \nd G‹H‹Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a)›H›G\nd* said: This sickness not is to death, but for the glory of_\nd god\nd*, in_order_that the son of_\nd god\nd* may_be_glorified by it.
\v 5 And \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* was_loving G‹Martha›G, and the sister of_her, and G‹Lazaros›G.
\v 6 Therefore when he_heard that he_is_ailing, then indeed he_remained in \add +the\add*_place which he_was two days.
\v 7 Then after this he_is_saying to_the apprentices/followers: We_may_be_going into Rx-G‹Youdaia›G-Rx again.
\v 8 The Disciples are_saying to_him: , My_great_\add >one\add*, the G‹Youdaiōns›G were_seeking now to_stone you, and you_are_going there again. 
\v 9 \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* answered are not Twelve, hours of_the day. If anyone may_be_walking in the day, he_is_ not _stumbling, because he_is_seeing the light of_ this _world.
\v 10 But if anyone may_be_walking in the night, he_is_stumbling, because the light is not in him.
\v 11 He_said these \add >things\add*, and after this he_is_saying to_them: G‹Lazaros›G the \add +the\add*_friend of_us has_been_fallen_asleep, but I_am_going, in_order_that I_may_awaken him.
\v 12 Therefore the apprentices/followers said to_him: \nd master\nd*, if he_has_been_fallen_asleep he_will_be_being_healed.
\v 13 But \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* had_spoken about the death of_him. But those supposed that he_is_speaking about the sleep of_sleep.
\v 14 Therefore then \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* said to_them with_plainness: G‹Lazaros›G died_off,
\v 15 and I_am_rejoicing because_of you_all, that not I_was there in_order_that you_all_may_believe, but we_may_be_going to him.
\v 16 Therefore G‹Thōmas›G being_called G‹Didumos/[twin]›G said, to_the fellow-apprentices/followers: May_be_ we _going also, in_order_that we_may_die_off with him.
\v 17 Therefore having_come \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* found him, having already four days. in the tomb.
\v 18 And G‹Bēthania›G was near G‹H‹Hierousalēm/(Yərūshālam)›H›G, from about fifteen G‹stadion_\add measure\add*›Gs.
\v 19 And many of the G‹Youdaiōns›G had_come to G‹Martha›G and G‹H‹Maria, in_order_that they_may_console them concerning their brother.
\v 20 Therefore G‹Martha›G when, she_heard that \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* is_coming, met with_him, But G‹H‹Maria/(Mirəyām)›H›G was_sitting in the house.
\v 21 Therefore G‹Martha›G said to \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd*: \nd master\nd*, if you_were here, the brother of_me would not died_off.
\v 22 also now I_have_known that as_much_as you_may_request \nd god\nd*, \nd god\nd* will_be_giving to_you.
\v 23 \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* is_saying to_her, the brother of_you Will_be_rising_up.
\v 24 G‹Martha›G is_saying to_him: I_have_known that he_will_be_rising_up in the resurrection at the last day.
\v 25 \nd G‹H‹Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a)›H›G\nd* said to_her: I am the resurrection and the life, the \add >one\add* believing in me, even_if he_may_die_off, will_be_living,
\v 26 and everyone living and believing in me, by_no_means may_ not _die_off to the age. Are_you_believing this. 
\v 27 She_is_saying to_him: Yes, \nd master\nd*, I have_believed that you are the \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd*, the son of_\nd god\nd*, the \add >one\add* coming into the world.
\v 28 And having_said this she_went_away, and called G‹H‹Maria, the sister of_her secretly, having_said: The teacher is_coming, and he_is_calling you.
\v 29 And that \add woman\add* when she_heard, she_was_raised quickly and was_coming to him.
\v 30 And \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* had_ not_yet _come into the village, but was still at the place where G‹Martha›G met with_him.
\v 31 Therefore the G‹Youdaiōns›G being with her in the house and consoling her, having_seen that G‹H‹Maria quickly she_rose_up and came_out, they_followed after_her, having_supposed that she_is_going to the tomb, in_order_that she_may_weep there.
\v 32 Therefore G‹H‹Maria, when she_came where \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* was, having_seen him, fell of_him at his feet, saying to_him, \nd master\nd*, if you_were here, the brother of_me not died_off.
\v 33 Therefore \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* when he_saw her weeping, and the \add >ones\add* G‹Youdaiōns›G having_come_together to_her weeping, he_groaned in_the spirit and disturbed himself.
\v 34 And he_said: Where have_you_all_laid him. They_are_saying to_him: \nd master\nd*, be_coming and see.
\v 35 \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* wept.
\v 36 Therefore the G‹Youdaiōns›G were_saying: See how he_was_loving him. 
\v 37 But some of them said: This \add man\add* the \add >one\add* having_opened_up the eyes of_the blind \add man\add* was_ not _able, to_ also _make that this \add >one\add* may_ not _die_off. 
\v 38 Therefore \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* again groaning in himself, is_coming to the tomb. And it_was \add +a\add*_cave, and \add +a\add*_stone was_laying_on against it.
\v 39 \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* is_saying: Take_away the stone. G‹Martha›G the \add +the\add*_sister of_the \add >one\add* having_died is_saying to_him: \nd master\nd*, he_is_ already _stinking, for it_is \add +the\add*_fourth \add day\add*.
\v 40 \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* is_saying to_her: Not I_said to_you that if you_may_believe, you_will_be_seeing the glory of_\nd god\nd*. 
\v 41 Therefore they_took_away the stone. And \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* lifted_up his eyes upward, and said: father, I_am_giving_thanks to_you that you_heard from_me.
\v 42 And I had_known that always you_are_hearing from_me, but because_of the crowd having_stood_around, I_said \add it\add*, in_order_that they_may_believe that you sent_ me _out.
\v 43 And having_said these \add >things\add*, with_\add +a\add*_ loud _voice he_cried_out: G‹Lazaros›G, come out.
\v 44 the \add >one\add* having_died Came_out, his feet and his hands having_been_bound with_linen_strips, and the face of_him had_been_bound_about. with_\add +a\add*_handkerchief. \nd G‹H‹Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a)›H›G\nd* is_saying to_them: Release him and allow him to_be_going.
\v 45 Therefore many of the G‹Youdaiōns›G, having_come to G‹H‹Maria/(Mirəyām)›H›G, and having_seen what he_did, they_believed in him.
\v 46 But some of them went_away to the G‹Farisaios_\add sect\add*›G, and told to_them what \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* did.
\v 47 Therefore the chief_priests and the G‹Farisaios_\add sect\add*›G gathered_together \add +the\add*_council, and they_were_saying: What are_we_doing, because this man is_doing many signs. 
\v 48 If we_may_allow him thus, all will_be_believing in him, and the G‹Ɽōmaios›G will_be_coming, and they_will_be_taking_away of_us both the place and the nation.
\v 49 But \add +a\add*_ one _certain of them, G‹Kaiafas›G being chief_priest year that, said to_them: You_all have_ not _known nothing. 
\v 50 Nor you_all_are_reckoning that it_is_benefitting for_you_all that one man may_die_off for the people, and not all the nation may_perish.
\v 51 And he_said this not from himself, but being chief_priest that year, he_prophesied that \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* was_going to_be_dying_off for the nation,
\v 52 and not only for the nation, but in_order_that also the children of_\nd god\nd*, the \add >ones\add* having_been_scattered may_gather_together into one.
\v 53 Therefore from that day, they_counselled that they_may_kill_ him _off.
\v 54 therefore \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* no_longer was_walking in_public among the G‹Youdaiōns›G, but went_away from_there into the region near the desert, to \add +a\add*_city being_called Ephraim, and_there he_remained with the apprentices/followers.
\v 55 And the passover_\add feast\add* of_the G‹Youdaiōns›G was near, and many went_up to G‹H‹Hierousalēm/(Yərūshālam)›H›G out_of the region before the passover_, in_order_that they_may_purify themselves.
\v 56 Therefore they_were_seeking \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd*, and they_were_saying with one_another having_stood in the temple: What it_is_supposing to_you_all. That by_no_means he_may_ not _come to the feast. 
\v 57 And had_given the chief_priests and the G‹Farisaios_\add sect\add*›G commandments, that if anyone may_know where he_is, he_may_divulge \add it\add*, so_that they_may_arrest him.
\c 12
\v 1 Therefore Six days before the passover_ \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd*, came to G‹Bēthania›G, where G‹Lazaros›G was, whom \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* raised from \add +the\add*_dead.
\v 2 Therefore they_made \add +a\add*_supper for_him there, and G‹Martha›G was_serving, and G‹Lazaros›G was one of the \add >ones\add* reclining with him.
\v 3 Therefore G‹H‹Maria having_taken \add +a\add*_pound of_ointment of_ precious genuine _nard, anointed the feet of_\nd G‹H‹Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a)›H›G\nd*, and wiped_off the feet of_him with_the hairs of_her, and the house was_filled with the aroma of_the ointment.
\v 4 But G‹H‹Youdas/(Yəhūdāh)›H›G G‹Iskariōtēs›G, one of_the apprentices/followers of_him, the \add >one\add* going to_be_giving_ him _over, is_saying,
\v 5 for_ Why _reason this ointment was_ not _sold for_three_hundred G‹dēnarion_\add coins\add*›G, and was_given to_\add +the\add*_poor. 
\v 6 But he_said this, not that was_caring to_him for the poor, but because he_was \add +a\add*_thief, and having the moneybag was_bearing the \add money\add* being_throw \add in\add*.
\v 7 Therefore \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* said: Allow her, in_order_that she_may_keep it for the day of_the burial of_me.
\v 8 For you_all_are_ always _having the poor with yourselves, but you_all_are_ not always _having me.
\v 9 Therefore \add +a\add*_ great _crowd of the G‹Youdaiōns›G knew that he_is there, and they_came, not only because_of \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd*, but in_order_that they_may_ also _see G‹Lazaros›G, whom he_raised from \add +the\add*_dead.
\v 10 But the chief_priests counselled that they_may_kill_off G‹Lazaros›G also,
\v 11 because many of_the G‹Youdaiōns›G were_going_away because_of him, and they_were_believing in \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd*.
\v 12 On_the \add day\add* of_next the great crowd, the \add >one\add* having_come to the feast, having_heard that \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* is_coming into G‹H‹Hierousalēm,
\v 13 they_took palm_branches of_the palm_trees and came_out in meeting to_him, and they_were_crying_out: Blessed_saviour. Having_been_blessed \add =is\add* the \add >one\add* coming in \add +the\add*_name of_\add +the\add*_\nd master\nd*, and the king of_Rx-G‹H‹Israēl/(Yisərā'ēl)›H›G-Rx. 
\v 14 And \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* having_found \add +a\add*_little_donkey, sat_down on it, as is having_been_written,
\v 15 be_ not _fearing, daughter of_G‹H‹Siōn/(Tsiuōn)›H›G, see, the king of_you is_coming, sitting on \add +a\add*_colt of_\add +a\add*_donkey.
\v 16 The Disciples of_him not knew these \add >things\add* from_the first, but when \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* was_glorified, then they_were_reminded that these \add >things\add* was having_been_written concerning him, and they_did these \add >things\add* to_him.
\v 17 Therefore the crowd was_testifying being with him, when he_called G‹Lazaros›G out_of the tomb, and raised him from \add +the\add*_dead.
\v 18 Because_of this the crowd also met with_him, because they_heard about_him to_have_done this sign.
\v 19 Therefore the G‹Farisaios_\add sect\add*›G said to themselves: You_all_are_observing that you_all_are_ not _benefiting nothing, see, the world went_away after him.
\v 20 And G‹Hellēns›G were some of the \add >ones\add* going_up, in_order_that they_may_worship at the feast, 
\v 21 therefore these approached to_Rx-G‹Filippos›G-Rx, who from G‹Bēthsaida›G of_G‹H‹Galilaia/(Gālīl)›H›G, and they_were_asking him saying: Sir, we_are_wanting to_see \nd G‹H‹Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a)›H›G\nd*.
\v 22 Rx-G‹Filippos›G-Rx is_coming and he_is_telling to_G‹Andreas›G, G‹Andreas›G and Rx-G‹Filippos›G-Rx is_coming and they_are_telling to_\nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd*.
\v 23 And \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* is_answering to_them saying: The hour has_come, in_order_that the son of_Man may_be_glorified.
\v 24 Truly, truly, I_am_saying to_you_all, if the seed of_wheat may_ not _die_off having_fallen into the ground, only it is_remaining, but if it_may_die_off, it_is_bearing much fruit.
\v 25 The \add >one\add* loving the life of_him, is_losing it, and the \add >one\add* hating the life of_him in this world, will_be_keeping it to eternal life.
\v 26 If anyone may_be_serving unto_me, him _let_be_following after_me, and where am I, there also my servant will_be. If anyone may_be_serving unto_me, the father will_be_honoring him.
\v 27 Now the soul of_me has_been_disturbed, and what may_I_say: father, save me from this hour. But because_of this, I_came to this hour.
\v 28 father, glorify the name of_you. Therefore \add +a\add*_voice came out_of heaven: Both I_glorified \add it\add*, and I_will_be_glorifying \add it\add* again.
\v 29 Therefore the crowd having_stood and having_heard, was_saying thunder to_have_become. Others were_saying: \add +An\add*_angel has_spoken to_him.
\v 30 \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* answered and said, this voice has_become not because_of me, but because_of you_all.
\v 31 Now is \add +the\add*_judgment of_ this _world, now the ruler of_ this _world will_be_being_throw_out out.
\v 32 And_I if may_be_exalted from the earth, I_will_be_drawing all to myself.
\v 33 But he_was_saying this, signifying by_what death he_was_going to_be_dying_off.
\v 34 Therefore the crowd answered to_him: We heard out_of the law that the \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd* is_remaining to the age, and how are_saying you that it_is_fitting the son of_Man to_be_exalted. Who is this son of_Man. 
\v 35 Therefore \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* said to_them: The light is with you_all still \add +a\add*_little time. be_walking while you_all_are_having the light, in_order_that you_all may_ not _grasp darkness, and the \add >one\add* walking in the darkness, has_ not _known where he_is_going.
\v 36 While you_all_are_having the light, be_believing in the light, in_order_that you_all_may_become sons of_light. \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* spoke these \add >things\add*, and having_gone_away, was_hidden from them.
\v 37 But having_done so_many signs of_him before them, they_were_ not _believing in him,
\v 38 in_order_that the word of_G‹H‹Ēsaias/(Yəsha'əyāh)›H›G the prophet may_be_fulfilled that he_said: \nd master\nd*, who believed in_the report of_us. And to_whom was_revealed the arm of_\add +the\add*_\nd master\nd*. 
\v 39 Because_of this they_were_ not _able to_be_believing, because again G‹H‹Ēsaias said,
\v 40 he_has_blinded the eyes of_them and he_maimed the heart of_them, in_order_that they_may_ not _see with_their eyes and they_may_understand with_their heart, and they_may_be_turned and I_will_be_healing them.
\v 41 G‹H‹Ēsaias said these \add >things\add*, because he_saw the glory of_him, and spoke concerning him.
\v 42 Likewise however even many from of_the rulers believed in him, but because_of the G‹Farisaios_\add sect\add*›G they_were_ not _confessing, in_order_that they_ not _may_become excommunicated.
\v 43 For they_loved the glory of_humans more than the glory of_\nd god\nd*.
\v 44 and \nd G‹H‹Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a)›H›G\nd* cried_out and said: The \add >one\add* believing in me, is_ not _believing in me, but in the \add >one\add* having_sent me,
\v 45 and the \add >one\add* observing me, is_observing the \add >one\add* having_sent me.
\v 46 I have_come into the world as_\add +a\add*_light, in_order_that everyone believing in me, in the darkness may_ not _remain.
\v 47 And if anyone may_hear of_the words of_me, and not may_keep \add them\add*, I am_ not _judging him, for I_came not, in_order_that I_may_judge the world, but in_order_that I_may_save the world.
\v 48 The \add >one\add* rejecting me and not receiving the words of_me, is_having the \add >one\add* judging him, the word which I_spoke, that will_be_judging him at the last day.
\v 49 Because I spoke not from myself, but the father himself having_sent me to_me has_given \add +a\add*_commandment, what I_may_say, and what I_may_speak.
\v 50 And I_have_known that the commandment of_him is eternal life. Therefore what I am_speaking, as the father has_said to_me, thus I_am_speaking.
\c 13
\v 1 And before the feast of_the passover_\add feast\add*, \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* having_known that the hour of_him came, that he_may_depart out_of this world to the father, having_loved his own who \add were\add* in the world, he_loved them to \add +the\add*_end.
\v 2 And becoming, supper, the devil already having_put into the heart G‹H‹Youdas/(Yəhūdāh)›H›G of_Rx-G‹Simōn›G-Rx G‹Iskariōtēs›G that may_give_ him _over,
\v 3 having_known that the father has_given all \add >things\add* to_him, into his hands, and that he_came_out from \nd god\nd* and he_is_going to \nd god\nd*,
\v 4 he_is_being_raised from the supper and is_laying \add aside\add* his clothes, and having_taken \add +a\add*_linen_towel he_girded himself.
\v 5 Thereafter he_is_putting water into the wash_basin, and began to_be_washing the feet of_the apprentices/followers, and to_be_wiping_off \add them\add* with_the linen_towel with_which he_was having_been_girded.
\v 6 Therefore he_is_coming to Rx-G‹Simōn›G-Rx G‹Petros›G. He_is_saying to_him: \nd master\nd*, are_ you _washing the feet of_me. 
\v 7 \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* answered and said to_him: What I am_doing, you you_have_ not _known now, but you_will_be_knowing after these \add >things\add*.
\v 8 G‹Petros›G is_saying to_him: By_no_means you_may_ not _wash the feet of_me to the age. \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* answered to_him: If I_may_ not _wash you, are_ not _having part with me.
\v 9 Rx-G‹Simōn›G-Rx G‹Petros›G is_saying to_him: \nd master\nd*, not only the feet of_me, but also my hands and my head.
\v 10 \nd G‹H‹Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a)›H›G\nd* is_saying to_him: The \add >one\add* having_been_washed is_ not _having need, except to_wash the feet, but he_is all clean, and you_all are clean, but not all.
\v 11 For he_had_known the \add >one\add* giving_ him _over, because_of this he_said, You_all_are not all clean.
\v 12 Therefore when he_washed the feet of_them, took the clothes of_him, and sat_down, again he_said to_them: Are_you_all_knowing what I_have_done to_you_all. 
\v 13 You_all are_calling me Teacher and, \nd master\nd*, and you_all_are_saying rightly, for I_am.
\v 14 Therefore if I the \nd master\nd* and the Teacher washed the feet of_you_all, you_all also are_ought to_be_washing the feet of_one_another.
\v 15 For I_have_given to_you_all \add +an\add*_example that as I did to_you_all, you_all also may_be_doing.
\v 16 Truly, truly, I_am_saying to_you_all, is not \add +a\add*_slave greater \add =than\add* the master of_him, nor \add +an\add*_ambassador greater \add =than\add* the \add >one\add* having_sent him.
\v 17 If you_all_have_known these \add >things\add*, you_all_are blessed if you_all_may_be_doing them.
\v 18 I_am_speaking not about all of_you_all. I have_known whom_all I_chose, but in_order_that the scripture may_be_fulfilled: the \add >one\add* eating the bread with me, lifted_up the heel of_him against me.
\v 19 From now I_am_telling to_you_all before the \add time\add* to_become, in_order_that you_all_may_believe whenever it_may_become that I am \add he\add*.
\v 20 Truly, truly, I_am_saying to_you_all, the \add >one\add* receiving anyone I_may_send, is_receiving me, and the \add >one\add* receiving me, is_receiving the \add >one\add* having_sent me.
\v 21 Having_said these \add >things\add*, \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* was_disturbed in_spirit and testified and said: Truly, truly, I_am_saying to_you_all that one of you_all will_be_giving_ me _over.
\v 22 Therefore the apprentices/followers were_looking among one_another, perplexing about whom he_is_speaking.
\v 23 And one out_of the apprentices/followers whom \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* was_loving was reclining in the bosom of_him of_\nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd*.
\v 24 Therefore Rx-G‹Simōn›G-Rx G‹Petros›G is_nodding to_this \add >one\add*, to_inquire who it_might_be about whom he_is_speaking.
\v 25 therefore that \add >one\add* Having_leaned_back thus on the chest of_\nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd*, is_saying to_him: \nd master\nd*, who is_it. 
\v 26 \nd G‹H‹Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a)›H›G\nd* is_answering: That \add >one\add* is to_whom I, having_dipped the piece_of_bread will_be_handing_out \add it\add*. And having_dipped the piece_of_bread, he_is_giving to_G‹H‹Youdas/(Yəhūdāh)›H›G of_Rx-G‹Simōn›G-Rx G‹Iskariōtēs›G.
\v 27 And after the piece_of_bread, then G‹H‹Satan/(Sāţān)›H›G came_in into that \add >one\add*. Therefore \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* is_saying to_him: What you_are_doing, do more_quickly.
\v 28 And no_one of_the \add >ones\add* reclining knew, to what he_said this to_him.
\v 29 For some were_supposing, from G‹H‹Youdas was_having the moneybag, that \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* is_saying to_him: Buy of_what \add >things\add* we_are_having need for the feast, or in_order_that something may_give to_the poor.
\v 30 Therefore having_received the piece_of_bread, that \add >one\add* came_out immediately. And it_was night.
\v 31 Therefore when he_came_out, \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* is_saying: Now the son of_Man was_glorified, and \nd god\nd* was_glorified in him.
\v 32 Also \nd god\nd* will_be_glorifying him in himself, and immediately will_be_glorifying him.
\v 33 Little_children, I_am still \add +a\add*_little \add time\add* with you_all. You_all_will_be_seeking me, and as I_said to_the G‹Youdaiōns›G, Where I am_going, you_all are_ not _being_able to_come, now I_am_ also _saying to_you_all.
\v 34 I_am_giving to_you_all \add +a\add*_ new _commandment, that you_all_may_be_loving one_another, as I_loved you_all, that also you_all may_be_loving one_another.
\v 35 By this all will_be_knowing that you_all_are my apprentices/followers, if you_all_may_be_having love among one_another.
\v 36 Rx-G‹Simōn›G-Rx G‹Petros›G is_saying to_him: \nd master\nd*, where you_are_going. \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* answered to_him: Where I_am_going, you_are_ not _being_able to_follow after_me now, but you_will_be_following later.
\v 37 G‹Petros›G is_saying to_him: \nd master\nd*, for_ why _reason I_am_ not _being_able to_follow after_you now. I_will_be_laying \add down\add* the life of_me for you.
\v 38 \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* Is_answering: Will_you_be_laying the life of_you for me. Truly, truly, I_am_saying to_you, by_no_means \add +the\add*_rooster may_ not _crow, until of_which you_will_be_disowning me thrice.
\c 14
\v 1 Not let_be_being_disturbed the heart of_you_all, you_are_believing in \nd god\nd*, also you_are_believing in me.
\v 2 Many dwellings are in the house of_the father of_me, and if not, I_ would _told to_you_all, because I_am_going to_prepare \add +a\add*_place for_you_all.
\v 3 And if I_may_be_gone and I_may_prepare you_all \add +a\add*_place I_am_coming again and I_will_be_receiving you_all to myself, in_order_that where am I, you_all may_be also.
\v 4 And you_all_have_known the way where I am_going.
\v 5 G‹Thōmas›G is_saying to_him: \nd master\nd*, we_have_ not _known where you_are_going, how are_we_being_able to_have_known the way. 
\v 6 \nd G‹H‹Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a)›H›G\nd* is_saying to_him: I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No_one is_coming to the father, except by me.
\v 7 If you_all_had_known me, you_all_ also _will_be_knowing the father of_me, and from now you_all_are_knowing him and you_all_have_seen him.
\v 8 Rx-G‹Filippos›G-Rx is_saying to_him: \nd master\nd*, show the father to_us, and it_is_sufficing for_us.
\v 9 \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* is_saying to_him: So_much time I_am with you_all, and you_have_ not _known me, Rx-G‹Filippos›G-Rx. The \add >one\add* having_seen me, has_seen the father, how are_ you _saying: Show the father to_us. 
\v 10 You_are_ not _believing that I in the father, and the father is in me. The words which I am_speaking to_you_all, I_am_ not _speaking from myself, but the \add +the\add*_father remaining in me, is_doing the works of_him.
\v 11 Be_believing in_me that I in the father, and the father in me, but if not, be_believing because_of the works of_him.
\v 12 Truly, truly, I_am_saying to_you_all, the \add >one\add* believing in me, the works that I am_doing, also_that \add >one\add* will_be_doing, and he_will_be_doing greater \add =than\add* these, because I am_going to the father.
\v 13 And whatever anything may_be_requested in the name of_me, this I_will_be_doing, in_order_that the father may_be_glorified in the son.
\v 14 If you_all_may_request me anything in the name of_me, this will_be_doing \add it\add*.
\v 15 If you_all_are_loving me, you_all_will_be_keeping my commandments.
\v 16 And_I will_be_asking the father, and he_will_be_giving another advocate to_you_all, in_order_that he_may_be with you_all to the age
\v 17 the \nd spirit\nd* of_truth, whom the world is_ not _able to_receive, because it_is_ not _observing nor is_knowing him. You_all are_knowing him, because he_is_remaining with you_all, and is in you_all.
\v 18 I will_ not _be_leaving you_all orphans, I_am_coming to you_all.
\v 19 Still \add +a\add*_little \add time\add* and the world is_ no_longer _observing me, but you_all are_observing me, because I am_living, also you_all will_be_living.
\v 20 In that day will_be_knowing you_all that I in the father of_me, and you_all in me, and_I in you_all.
\v 21 The \add >one\add* having the commandments of_me and keeping them, that \add >one\add* is the \add >one\add* loving me, and the \add >one\add* loving me, will_be_being_loved by the father of_me, and_I will_be_loving him, and will_be_manifesting myself to_him.
\v 22 G‹H‹Youdas/(Yəhūdāh)›H›G not to_him the G‹Iskariōtēs›G is_saying: \nd master\nd*, what has_become, that you_are_going to_be_manifesting yourself to_us, and not to_the world. 
\v 23 \nd G‹H‹Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a)›H›G\nd* answered and said to_him: If anyone may_be_loving me, he_will_be_keeping the word of_me, and the father of_me will_be_loving him, and we_will_be_coming to him, and we_will_be_making \add +a\add*_dwelling with him.
\v 24 The \add >one\add* not loving me, is_ not _keeping the words of_me, and word that you_all_are_hearing, is not mine, but of_the father having_sent me.
\v 25 I_have_spoken these \add >things\add* to_you_all remaining with you_all.
\v 26 But the advocate, the holy \nd spirit\nd*, whom the father will_be_sending in the name of_me, that \add >one\add* will_be_teaching you_all all \add >things\add*, and will_be_reminding you_all all \add >things\add* which I_said to_you_all.
\v 27 I_am_leaving peace with_you_all, I_am_giving my peace to_you_all, not as the world is_giving, I am_giving to_you_all. Let_ not _be_being_disturbed the heart of_you_all, nor it _let_be_fearing.
\v 28 You_all_heard that I said to_you_all: I_am_going_away and I_am_coming to you_all. If you_all_were_loving me, you_all_ would _were_elated that I_am_going to the father, of_me because the father is greater \add =than\add* of_me.
\v 29 And now I_have_told to_you_all before \add it\add* to_become, in_order_that whenever it_may_become, you_all_may_believe.
\v 30 I_will_be_speaking no_ much _longer with you_all, for the ruler of_the world is_coming, and he_is_ not _having nothing in me,
\v 31 but in_order_that the world may_know that I_am_loving the father, and as the father he_gave commandment to_me, thus I_am_doing. Be_raising, we_may_be_going from_here.
\c 15
\v 1 I am the true vine, and the father of_me is the farmer.
\v 2 Every branch in me not bearing fruit, he_is_taking_ it _away, and every_ fruit bearing _\add branch\add*, he_is_pruning it, in_order_that it_may_be_bearing more. fruit.
\v 3 You_all are already clean, because_of the word which I_have_spoken to_you_all.
\v 4 Remain in me, and_I in you_all. As the branch is_ not _able to_be_bearing fruit of itself, if it_may_ not _remain in the vine, thus neither you_all, if you_all _may_ not _be_remaining in me.
\v 5 I am the vine, you_all \add =are\add* the branches. The \add >one\add* remaining in me and_I in him, this \add >one\add* is_bearing much fruit, because apart_from me, you_all_are_ not _being_able to_be_doing not one \add >thing\add*.
\v 6 If anyone may_ not _be_remaining in me, he_was_throw out as the branch and was_withered, and they_are_gathering_ them _together and they_are_throwing into the fire, and it_is_being_burned.
\v 7 If you_all_may_remain in me, and the words of_me may_remain in you_all, whatever you_all_may_be_wanting, request and it_will_be_becoming to_you_all.
\v 8 In this the father of_me was_glorified, that you_all_may_be_bearing much fruit and you_all_may_become to_my apprentices/followers.
\v 9 As the father loved me, also_I loved you_all, remain in my love.
\v 10 If you_all_may_keep the commandments of_me, you_all_will_be_remaining in the love of_me, as I have_kept the commandments of_the father, and I_am_remaining in the love of_him.
\v 11 I_have_spoken these \add >things\add* to_you_all, in_order_that my joy may_be in you_all, and the joy of_you_all may_be_fulfilled.
\v 12 This is my commandment, that may_be_loving one_another as I_loved you_all.
\v 13 No_one is_having love greater \add =than\add* this: that may_lay the life of_himself for the friends of_him.
\v 14 You_all are friends of_me, if you_all_may_be_doing what I am_commanding to_you_all.
\v 15 I_am_ no_longer _calling you_all slaves, because the slave has_ not _known what the master of_him is_doing. But you_all I_have_called friends, because I_made_known to_you_all all \add >things\add* what I_heard from the father of_me.
\v 16 You_all not chose me, but I chose you_all, and I_appointed you_all in_order_that you_all may_be_going and may_be_bearing fruit, and the fruit of_you_all may_be_remaining, in_order_that whatever anything you_all_may_request the father in the name of_me, he_may_give to_you_all.
\v 17 I_am_commanding these \add >things\add* to_you_all, that you_all_may_be_loving one_another.
\v 18 If the world is_hating you_all, you_all_are_knowing that it_has_hated me before of_you_all.
\v 19 If you_all_were of the world, the world would was_loving its own, but because you_all_are not of the world, but I chose you_all out_of the world, because_of this the world is_hating you_all.
\v 20 Be_remembering about_the word which I said to_you_all: \add +a\add*_slave is not greater \add =than\add* the master of_him. If they_persecuted me, they will_ also _be_persecuting you_all, if they_kept the word of_me, they will_ also _be_keeping your \add word\add*.
\v 21 But they_will_be_doing all these \add >things\add* against you_all because_of the name of_me, because they_have_ not _known the \add >one\add* having_sent me.
\v 22 They_were_ not _having sin except I_came and spoke to_them, but now they_are_ not _having excuse for the sin of_them.
\v 23 The \add >one\add* hating me, is_ also _hating the father of_me.
\v 24 If not I_did the works among them that not_one other did, they_were_ not _having, sin, but now both they_have_seen and they_have_hated, both me and the father of_me.
\v 25 But in_order_that the word having_been_written in the law of_them may_be_fulfilled, they_hated me undeservedly.
\v 26 Whenever the advocate may_come, whom I will_be_sending to_you_all from the father, the \nd spirit\nd* of_truth, who is_going_out from the father, that \add >one\add* will_be_testifying concerning me.
\v 27 Also and you_all are_testifying, because you_all_are with me from \add +the\add*_beginning.
\c 16
\v 1 I_have_spoken these \add >things\add* to_you_all, in_order_that you_all _may_ not _be_stumbled.
\v 2 they_will_be_making you_all excommunicated, but \add +an\add*_hour is_coming, that everyone having_killed_ you_all _off, may_suppose \add it_is\add* \add +a\add*_sacred_service to_be_offering to_\nd god\nd*.
\v 3 And they_will_be_doing these \add >things\add*, because they_ not _knew the father nor me.
\v 4 But I_have_spoken these \add >things\add* to_you_all, in_order_that whenever the hour of_them may_come, you_all_may_be_remembering that I told to_you_all about_them. But these \add >things\add* I_ not _said to_you_all from \add +the\add*_beginning, because I_was with you_all.
\v 5 But now I_am_going to the \add >one\add* having_sent me, and no_one of you_all is_asking me: Where are_you_going. 
\v 6 But because I_have_spoken these \add >things\add* to_you_all, sorrow has_filled the heart of_you_all.
\v 7 But I am_saying the truth to_you_all, it_is_benefitting for_you_all that I may_go_away. For if I_may_ not _go_away, the advocate he will_ not _be_coming to you_all, but if I_may_be_gone, I_will_be_sending him to you_all.
\v 8 And having_come, that \add >one\add* will_be_rebuking the world concerning sin, and concerning righteousness, and concerning judgment, 
\v 9 concerning sin on_one_hand, because they_are_ not _believing in me, 
\v 10 concerning righteousness on_the_other_hand, because I_am_going to the father, and you_all_are_ no_longer _observing me, 
\v 11 and concerning judgment, because the ruler of_ this _world has_been_judged.
\v 12 I_am_ still _having many \add >things\add* to_be_saying to_you_all, but you_all_are_ not _being_able to_be_bearing \add them\add* now.
\v 13 But whenever that \add >one\add* may_come, the \nd spirit\nd* of_truth, he_will_be_guiding you_all in all truth, for he will_ not _be_speaking from himself, but as_much_as he_will_be_hearing, he_will_be_speaking, and he_will_be_declaring to_you_all the \add >things\add* coming.
\v 14 That \add >one\add* will_be_glorifying me, because he_will_be_taking of what \add =is\add* mine, and will_be_declaring to_you_all.
\v 15 All \add >things\add* as_much_as the father is_having, is mine, because_of this I_said that of the \add >thing\add* of_mine he_is_taking, and will_be_declaring to_you_all.
\v 16 \add +A\add*_little \add time\add* and you_all_are_ no_longer _observing me, and again \add +a\add*_little \add time\add* and you_all_will_be_seeing me.
\v 17 Therefore the apprentices/followers of of_him said to one_another: What is this that he_is_saying to_us: \add +A\add*_little \add time\add* and you_all_are_ not _observing me, and again \add +a\add*_little \add time\add* and you_all_will_be_seeing me, and Because I_am_going to the father. 
\v 18 Therefore they_were_saying: What is this: \add +A\add*_little \add time\add*. We_have_ not _known what he_is_speaking.
\v 19 \nd G‹H‹Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a)›H›G\nd* knew that they_were_wanting to_be_asking him, and he_said to_them: You_all_are_seeking concerning this with one_another, because I_said: \add +A\add*_little \add time\add* and you_all_are_ not _observing me, and again \add +a\add*_little \add time\add* and you_all_will_be_seeing me. 
\v 20 Truly, truly, I_am_saying to_you_all that you_all will_be_weeping and will_be_lamenting, but the world will_be_being_elated, you_all will_be_being_sorrowed, but the sorrow of_you_all will_be_becoming to joy.
\v 21 The woman whenever she_may_be_bearing, is_having sorrow, because the hour of_her came, but whenever she_may_bear the little_child, she_is_ no_longer _remembering about_the tribulation because_of the joy that \add +a\add*_person was_born into the world.
\v 22 Therefore you_all also now on_one_hand you_all_are_having sorrow, on_the_other_hand I_will_be_seeing you_all again, and the heart of_you_all will_be_being_elated, and no_one is_taking_away the joy of_you_all, from you_all.
\v 23 And in that day you_all will_ not _be_asking me nothing. Truly, truly, I_am_saying to_you_all, anything you_all_may_request from_the father, in the name of_me. Will_be_giving to_you_all.
\v 24 Until now you_all_ not _requested nothing in the name of_me. Be_requesting and you_all_will_be_receiving, in_order_that the joy of_you_all may_be having_been_fulfilled.
\v 25 These \add >things\add* I_have_spoken to_you_all in allegories, \add +an\add*_hour is_coming when I will_ no_longer _be_speaking in allegories to_you_all, but I_will_be_reporting concerning the father with_plainness to_you_all.
\v 26 In that day you_all_will_be_requesting in the name of_me, and I_am_ not _saying to_you_all that I will_be_asking the father for you_all, 
\v 27 for the father himself is_loving you_all, because you_all have_loved me, and you_all_have_believed that I came_out from \nd god\nd*.
\v 28 I_came_out from the father, and I_have_come into the world, again I_am_leaving the world, and I_am_going to the father.
\v 29 The Disciples of_him are_saying: See now you_are_speaking with plainness, and you_are_speaking not_one allegory.
\v 30 Now we_have_known that you_have_known all \add >things\add*, and you_are_ not _having need that anyone you may_be_asking. By this we_are_believing that you_came_out from \nd god\nd*.
\v 31 \nd G‹H‹Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a)›H›G\nd* answered to_them, are_you_all_believing Now. 
\v 32 See \add +an\add*_hour is_coming and has_come, that you_all_may_be_scattered each to his own, and_ you_all_may_leave _me only, and_yet I_ not _am alone, because the father is with me.
\v 33 I_have_spoken these \add >things\add* to_you_all, in_order_that you_all_may_be_having peace in me. You_all_are_having tribulation in the world, but be_having_courage, I have_overcome the world.
\c 17
\v 1 \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* spoke these \add >things\add*, and having_lifted_up the eyes of_him to the sky said: father, the hour has_come, glorify the son of_you, in_order_that the son may_glorify you.
\v 2 As you_gave authority of_all flesh to_him, in_order_that everyone whom you_have_given to_him, you_may_give eternal life to_him.
\v 3 And this is eternal life, that they_may_be_knowing you, the only true \nd god\nd*, and \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd* whom you_sent_out.
\v 4 I you glorified on the earth, having_completed the work, that you_have_given to_me that I_may_do.
\v 5 And now you father glorify me, with yourself, with_the glory which I_was_having with you before the \add time\add* the world to_be.
\v 6 I_revealed the name of_you to_the men whom you_gave to_me out_of the world. they_were Yours, for_and_me you_gave them, and they_have_kept the word of_you.
\v 7 Now they_have_known that all \add >things\add* as_much_as you_have_given to_me, are from you, 
\v 8 because the words that you_gave to_me, I_have_given to_them, and they received \add them\add*, that truly I_came_out from you, and they_believed that you me sent_out.
\v 9 I am_asking concerning them, not concerning the world I_am_asking, but concerning whom you_have_given to_me, because they_are for_you.
\v 10 And all \add >things\add* what \add =is\add* mine, is yours, and what \add =is\add* yours, \add =is\add* mine, and I_have_been_glorified in them.
\v 11 And I_am no_longer, in the world, and_yet they in the world are, and_I am_coming to you. holy father, keep them in the name of_you, to_which you_gave to_me, in_order_that they_may_be one, as we \add =are\add*.
\v 12 When I_was with them, I was_keeping them to_me in the name of_you, to_which you_have_given, and I_guarded \add them\add*, and no_one of them perished, except the son of_destruction, in_order_that the scripture may_be_fulfilled.
\v 13 But now I_am_coming to you, and I_am_speaking these \add >things\add* in the world, in_order_that they_may_be_having my joy, having_been_fulfilled in themselves.
\v 14 I have_given the word of_you to_them, and the world hated them, because they_are not of the world, as I am not. of the world.
\v 15 I_am_ not _asking that you_may_take_ them _away out_of the world, but that you_may_keep them from evil.
\v 16 They_are not of the world, as I am not. of the world.
\v 17 Sanctify them by the truth, your word is truth.
\v 18 As you_sent_ me _out into the world, also_I sent_ them _out into the world.
\v 19 And for them am_sanctifying myself, in_order_that they also may_be having_been_sanctified in truth.
\v 20 But I_am_ not _asking for these only, but also for the \add >ones\add* believing in me through the word of_them,
\v 21 in_order_that they_may_be all one, as you, father, in me \add =are\add*, and_I \add =am\add* in you, in_order_that they also may_be in us, in_order_that the world may_be_believing that you sent_ me _out.
\v 22 And_I I_have_given to_them the glory which you_have_given to_me, in_order_that they_may_be one, as we one,
\v 23 I in them, and you in me, in_order_that they_may_be having_been_perfected in one, and the world may_be_knowing that you sent_ me _out, and you_loved them as you_loved me.
\v 24 father, I_am_wanting \add those\add* whom you_have_given to_me, in_order_that where am I, also_those may_be with me, in_order_that they_may_be_observing my glory, that you_gave to_me, because you_loved me before \add +the\add*_foundation of_\add +the\add*_world.
\v 25 righteous father, also the world not knew you, but I knew you, and these knew that you sent_ me _out.
\v 26 And I_made_known to_them the name of_you, and I_will_be_making_known \add it\add*, in_order_that the love which you_loved me, may_be in them, and_I in them.
\c 18
\v 1 Having_said these \add >things\add*, \nd G‹H‹Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a)›H›G\nd* came_out with the apprentices/followers of_him beyond the winter_stream of_the G‹H‹Kedrōn/(Qidərōn)›H›G, where was \add +a\add*_garden, into which he and the apprentices/followers of_him came_in.
\v 2 And G‹H‹Youdas/(Yəhūdāh)›H›G who giving_ him _over had_ also _known, the place, because often \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* was_gathered_together There with the apprentices/followers of_him.
\v 3 therefore G‹H‹Youdas having_received the cohort, and attendants from the chief_priests and G‹Farisaios_\add sect\add*›G, is_coming there with lanterns, and torches, and weapons.
\v 4 \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* and having_known all the \add >things\add* coming on him, having_come_out he_said to_them: Whom are_you_all_seeking. 
\v 5 They_answered to_him: \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* the G‹from_Nazaret›G. \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* he_is_saying to_them: I am \add he\add*. and also G‹H‹Youdas, who giving_ him _over had_stood, with them.
\v 6 Therefore when he_said to_them: I am \add he\add*, they_went_away back to the \add >things\add* and they_fell on_the_ground.
\v 7 Therefore again he_asked them: Whom are_you_all_seeking. And they said: \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* the G‹from_Nazaret›G.
\v 8 Answered \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd*: I_told to_you_all that I am \add he\add*. Therefore if you_all_are_seeking me, allow these to_be_going_away, 
\v 9 in_order_that the word may_be_fulfilled that he_said, whom you_have_given to_me, I_ not _lost no_one of them.
\v 10 Therefore Rx-G‹Simōn›G-Rx G‹Petros›G having \add +a\add*_sword, drew it and struck the slave of_the chief_priest, and cut_off the right ear of_him. And was G‹Malⱪos›G \add +the\add*_name to_the slave.
\v 11 Therefore \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* said to_G‹Petros›G: Put the sword into the sheath, the cup which the father has_given to_me, by_no_means I_may_ not _drink it. 
\v 12 Therefore the cohort, and the commander, and the attendants of_the G‹Youdaiōns›G, captured \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* and bound him.
\v 13 And they_led \add ~him\add* to G‹Annas›G first, for he_was father_in_law of_G‹Kaiafas›G, who was chief_priest of_ that _year.
\v 14 And G‹Kaiafas›G was the \add >one\add* having_counselled to_the G‹Youdaiōns›G that it_is_benefitting for_one man to_die_off for the people.
\v 15 And Rx-G‹Simōn›G-Rx G‹Petros›G and \add +the\add*_other apprentice/follower was_following. with_\nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd*. And that apprentice/follower was known to_the chief_priest, and he_entered_with with_\nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* into the courtyard of_the chief_priest.
\v 16 But G‹Petros›G had_stood at the door outside. Therefore the other apprentice/follower came_out which was known of_the chief_priest, and he_spoke to_the doorkeeper and brought_in G‹Petros›G.
\v 17 The servant_girl the doorkeeper is_saying therefore, to_G‹Petros›G: Are you not also of the apprentices/followers of_ this _man. That \add >one\add* he_is_saying: I_am not.
\v 18 And the slaves and the attendants had_stood, having_made \add +a\add*_charcoal_fire, because it_was cold, and they_were_warming \add themselves\add*, and G‹Petros›G was also with them having_stood and warming \add himself\add*.
\v 19 Therefore the chief_priest asked \nd G‹H‹Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a)›H›G\nd* concerning the apprentices/followers of_him, and concerning the teaching of_him.
\v 20 \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* answered to_him: I have_spoken with_plainness to_the world, I always taught in \add +the\add*_synagogue and in the temple, where all the G‹Youdaiōns›G are_coming_together, and I_spoke nothing in secret.
\v 21 Why are_you_asking me. Ask the \add >ones\add* having_heard what I_spoke to_them, see, these have_known what I said.
\v 22 And these \add >things\add* of_him having_said, one of_the \add >ones\add* attendants having_stood_by gave \add +a\add*_slap to_\nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* having_said: Are_you_answering thus to_the chief_priest. 
\v 23 \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* answered to_him: If I_spoke wrongly, testify concerning the evil, but if rightly, why are_you_beating me. 
\v 24 Therefore G‹Annas›G sent_ him _out, having_been_bound to G‹Kaiafas›G the chief_priest.
\v 25 And Rx-G‹Simōn›G-Rx G‹Petros›G was having_stood and warming \add himself\add*. Therefore they_said to_him: Are not you also of the apprentices/followers of_him. That \add >one\add* he_disowned and said: I_am not.
\v 26 one of the slaves of_the chief_priest, being \add +a\add*_relative of_whom G‹Petros›G cut_off his ear Is_saying: Not I saw you in the garden with him. 
\v 27 Therefore again G‹Petros›G disowned, and immediately \add +a\add*_rooster crowed.
\v 28 Therefore they_are_leading \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* from G‹Kaiafas›G into the residence_of_the_governor, and it_was early. And they not came_in into the residence_of_the_governor, in_order_that they _may_ not _be_defiled, but they_may_eat the passover_\add feast\add*.
\v 29 Therefore Rx-G‹Pilatos›G-Rx came_out outside to them and is_saying: What accusation are_you_all_bringing against this man. 
\v 30 They_answered and said to_him: Except this \add >one\add* was doing evil, we_ would not _gave_over him to_you
\v 31 Therefore Rx-G‹Pilatos›G-Rx said to_them: You_all take him, and judge according_to the law of_you_all, him. The G‹Youdaiōns›G said to_him, is_ not _permitting To_us to_kill_off no_one, 
\v 32 in_order_that the word of_\nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* may_be_fulfilled, that he_spoke, signifying by_what death he_was_going to_be_dying_off.
\v 33 Therefore Rx-G‹Pilatos›G-Rx came_in again into the residence_of_the_governor, and he_called \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* and said to_him: Are you the king of_the G‹Youdaiōns›G. 
\v 34 \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* answered Are_ you _saying this of yourself, or others said \add it\add* to_you concerning me. 
\v 35 Rx-G‹Pilatos›G-Rx answered: Surely_not am I \add +a\add*_Rx-G‹Youdaios›G-Rx. Your nation and the chief_priests gave_ you _over to_me. What did_you. 
\v 36 \nd G‹H‹Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a)›H›G\nd* answered: my kingdom is not of world this, if my kingdom was of this world, my attendants would were_fighting, in_order_that I _may_ not _be_given_over to_the G‹Youdaiōns›G. But now my kingdom is not from_here.
\v 37 Therefore Rx-G‹Pilatos›G-Rx said to_him: Are you not_then \add +a\add*_king. \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* answered: You are_saying that I am \add +a\add*_king. for this I_have_been_born, and for this I_have_come into the world, in_order_that I_may_testify to_the truth. Everyone being of the truth, is_hearing of_the voice of_me.
\v 38 Rx-G‹Pilatos›G-Rx is_saying to_him: What is truth. And having_said this, he_came_out again to the G‹Youdaiōns›G, and is_saying to_them: I am_finding not_one Guilt in him.
\v 39 But it_is \add +a\add*_custom with_you_all, that I_may_send_away one to_you_all at the passover_, therefore are_you_all_wishing I_may_send_away to_you_all the king of_the G‹Youdaiōns›G. 
\v 40 Therefore they_cried_out again saying: Not this \add >one\add*, but G‹Barabbas›G. And G‹Barabbas›G was \add +a\add*_robber.
\c 19
\v 1 Therefore Rx-G‹Pilatos›G-Rx then took \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* and flogged \add ~him\add*.
\v 2 And the soldiers having_twisted_together \add +a\add*_crown of thorns, they_put_on \add it\add* on_the head of_him, and they_clothed him in_\add +a\add*_ purple _robe,
\v 3 and they_were_coming to him and they_were_saying: Greetings, the king of_the G‹Youdaiōns›G. And they_were_giving slaps to_him.
\v 4 And Rx-G‹Pilatos›G-Rx came_out again outside, and is_saying to_them: See I_am_bringing him out to_you_all, in_order_that you_all_may_know that I_am_ not _finding guilt in him.
\v 5 Therefore \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* came_out outside, wearing the thorny crown and the purple robe. And he_is_saying to_them: See the man. 
\v 6 Therefore when the chief_priests and the attendants saw him, they_cried_out saying: Impale_on_a_stake. Impale_on_a_stake. Rx-G‹Pilatos›G-Rx is_saying to_them: You_all take him and impale_on_a_stake \add ~him\add*, for I am_ not _finding guilt in him.
\v 7 The G‹Youdaiōns›G answered: We are_having \add +a\add*_law, and according_to the law he_ought to_die_off, because he_made himself \add +the\add*_son of_\nd god\nd*.
\v 8 Therefore when Rx-G‹Pilatos›G-Rx heard this word, he_was_ more _afraid.
\v 9 And he_came_in into the residence_of_the_governor again, and is_saying to_\nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd*: From_where are you. But \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* not gave \add +an\add*_answer to_him.
\v 10 Therefore Rx-G‹Pilatos›G-Rx is_saying to_him, you_are_ not _speaking To_me. You_have_ not _known that I_am_having authority to_send_ you _away, and I_am_having authority to_impale_on_a_stake you. 
\v 11 \nd G‹H‹Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a)›H›G\nd* answered to_him: You_were_ not _having authority against me not_one, except was having_been_given to_you from_above. Because_of this the \add >one\add* having_given_ me _over to_you, is_having greater sin.
\v 12 Out_of this Rx-G‹Pilatos›G-Rx was_seeking to_send_away him. But the G‹Youdaiōns›G cried_out saying: If you_may_send_away this \add man\add*, you_are not \add +a\add*_friend of_Rx-G‹Kaisar›G-Rx. Everyone making himself \add +a\add*_king, is_speaking_against against_Rx-G‹Kaisar›G-Rx.
\v 13 Therefore Rx-G‹Pilatos›G-Rx, having_heard of_words these, brought outside \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd*, and he_sat_down on \add +the\add*_tribunal, at \add +a\add*_place being_called \add +the\add*_stone_pavement, But in_G‹Hebraios›G, G‹Gabbatha›G.
\v 14 And it_was \add +the\add*_preparation \add day\add* of_the passover_\add feast\add*, \add +the\add*_hour was about \add +the\add*_sixth. And he_is_saying to_the G‹Youdaiōns›G: See the king of_you_all. 
\v 15 And they cried_out: Take_away. Take_away. Impale_ him _on_a_stake. Rx-G‹Pilatos›G-Rx is_saying to_them: May_I_impale_on_a_stake the king of_you_all. The Chief_priests answered: We_are_ not _having \add +a\add*_king, except Rx-G‹Kaisar›G-Rx.
\v 16 Therefore then he_gave_ him _over, to_them, in_order_that he_may_be_impaled_on_a_stake. They_took And \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd*, led_ him _away
\v 17 And bearing the cross to_himself, he_came_out to the \add place\add* being_called: place of_\add +the\add*_skull, which is_being_called In_G‹Hebraios›G, G‹H‹Golgotha/(Guləggolet)›H›G,
\v 18 where they_impaled_ him _on_a_stake, and with him two others, on_this_side and on_that_side, and \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* in_\add +the\add*_middle.
\v 19 And Rx-G‹Pilatos›G-Rx wrote also \add +a\add*_title, and put on the cross. And it_was having_been_written: \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* the G‹from_Nazaret›G, the king of_the G‹Youdaiōns›G.
\v 20 Therefore this title many of_the G‹Youdaiōns›G read, because the place was near of_the city, where \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* was_impaled_on_a_stake, and it_was having_been_written In_G‹Hebraios›G, In_Latin, In_Rx-G‹Hellēn›G-Rx.
\v 21 Therefore the chief_priests of_the G‹Youdaiōns›G were_saying to_Rx-G‹Pilatos›G-Rx: Be_ not _writing: The king of_the G‹Youdaiōns›G, but that that \add >one\add* said: I_am king. of_the G‹Youdaiōns›G.
\v 22 Rx-G‹Pilatos›G-Rx answered: What I_have_written, I_have_written.
\v 23 Therefore the soldiers when they_impaled_on_a_stake \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd*, took the clothes of_him, and they_made four parts, \add +a\add*_part to_each soldier, and the tunic. And the tunic was seamless, from the_ top _\add parts\add* woven through all.
\v 24 Therefore they_said to one_another: We_may_ not _tear it, but we_may_choose_by_lot for it, whose it_will_be, in_order_that the scripture may_be_fulfilled saying: they_divided the clothes of_me to_themselves, and they_throw \add +a\add*_lot for the clothing of_me. The therefore on_one_hand soldiers did these \add >things\add*.
\v 25 On_the_other_hand the mother of_him had_stood by the cross of_\nd G‹H‹Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a)›H›G\nd*, and the sister of_the mother of_him, G‹H‹Maria/(Mirəyām)›H›G the \add wife\add* of_Clopas, and G‹H‹Maria the G‹from_Magdala›G.
\v 26 \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* therefore having_seen his mother, and the apprentice/follower having_stood_by whom he_was_loving, is_saying to_the mother: Woman, see, the son of_you.
\v 27 Thereafter he_is_saying to_the apprentice/follower: See the mother of_you. And from that hour took the apprentice/follower her to his own.
\v 28 After this having_known \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* that all \add >things\add* now has_been_accomplished, in_order_that the scripture may_be_completed, he_is_saying: I_am_thirsting.
\v 29 \add +A\add*_vessel was_lying full of_wine_vinegar, therefore \add +a\add*_sponge full of_the wine_vinegar having_put_around around_\add +a\add*_hyssop \add stalk\add*, they_brought over_it to_his mouth.
\v 30 Therefore when \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* took the wine_vinegar, he_said: It_has_been_finished. And having_bowed the head, he_gave_over his spirit.
\v 31 Therefore the G‹Youdaiōns›G, because it_was \add +the\add*_preparation \add day\add*, in_order_that the bodies may_ not _remain on the cross on the sabbath (for it_was great day of_that sabbath), they_asked Rx-G‹Pilatos›G-Rx that the legs of_them may_be_broken, and they_may_be_taken_away.
\v 32 Therefore the soldiers came, and they_broke the legs of_the first on_one_hand, and of_the other having_been_impaled_on_a_stake_with with_him, 
\v 33 on_the_other_hand having_come to \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd*, when they_saw him having_died already, they_ not _broke the legs of_him.
\v 34 But one of_the soldiers pierced the side of_him with_\add +a\add*_spear, and immediately blood and water came_out.
\v 35 And the \add >one\add* having_seen has_testified, and the testimony of_him is true, and that \add >one\add* has_known that he_is_speaking true, in_order_that also you_all you_all_may_be_believing.
\v 36 For these \add >things\add* became, in_order_that the scripture may_be_fulfilled: bone of_him will_ not _be_being_broken.
\v 37 And again another scripture is_saying: they_will_be_looking on whom they_pierced.
\v 38 And after these \add >things\add*, G‹H‹Yōsēf/(Yōşēf)›H›G from G‹Arimathaia›G being \add +a\add*_apprentice/follower of_\nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd*, but having_been_hidden because_of the fear of_the G‹Youdaiōns›G asked Rx-G‹Pilatos›G-Rx, that he_may_take_away the body of_\nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd*, and Rx-G‹Pilatos›G-Rx permitted \add it\add*. Therefore came and they_took_ him. _away.
\v 39 And G‹Nikodēmos›G also came, the \add >one\add* having_come to him at_the first by_night, bringing \add +a\add*_wrapping of_myrrh and aloe, about \add +a\add*_hundred pounds.
\v 40 Therefore they_took the body of_\nd G‹H‹Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a)›H›G\nd*, and they_bound it in_linen_cloths with the spices, as \add +the\add*_custom of_the G‹Youdaiōns›G is to_be_burying.
\v 41 And there_was \add +a\add*_garden in the place where he_was_impaled_on_a_stake, and in the garden \add +a\add*_ new _tomb, in which not_yet no_one was having_been_laid.
\v 42 Therefore because_of the preparation \add day\add* of_the G‹Youdaiōns›G, because near was the tomb, they_laid \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* there.
\c 20
\v 1 And on_the first \add day\add* of_the week, G‹H‹Maria/(Mirəyām)›H›G the G‹from_Magdala›G is_coming early, to the tomb still being darkness, and is_seeing the stone having_been_taken_away from the tomb.
\v 2 Therefore she_is_running and is_coming to Rx-G‹Simōn›G-Rx G‹Petros›G, and to the other apprentice/follower whom was_loving \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd*, and she_is_saying to_them: They_took_away the \nd master\nd* out_of the tomb, and we_have_ not _known where they_laid him.
\v 3 Therefore G‹Petros›G and the other apprentice/follower came_out, and they_were_coming to the tomb.
\v 4 And the two were_running together, and the other apprentice/follower ran_ahead more_quickly \add =than\add* G‹Petros›G, and came to the tomb first.
\v 5 And having_stooped_down, he_is_seeing lying \add there\add* the linen_cloths, however he_ not _came_in.
\v 6 Therefore Rx-G‹Simōn›G-Rx G‹Petros›G is_ also _coming following after_him, and came_in into the tomb, and is_observing the linen_cloths lying \add there\add*,
\v 7 and the handkerchief, which was on the head of_him, lying \add there\add* not with the linen_cloths, but separately having_been_wrapped in one place.
\v 8 Therefore then the other apprentice/follower also came_in, having_come first to the tomb, and he_saw and believed, 
\v 9 for they_had_ not_yet _known the scripture that it_is_fitting him to_rise_up from \add +the\add*_dead.
\v 10 Therefore the apprentices/followers they_went_away again to themselves.
\v 11 But G‹H‹Maria had_stood at the tomb outside weeping. Therefore as she_was_weeping, she_stooped_down into the tomb,
\v 12 and is_observing two angels in white sitting, one at the head, and one at the feet, where the body of_\nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* was_lying.
\v 13 And those are_saying to_her: Woman, why are_you_weeping. She_is_saying to_them: Because they_took_away the \nd master\nd* of_me, and I_have_ not _known where they_laid him.
\v 14 Having_said these \add >things\add*, she_was_turned back to the \add >things\add*, and is_observing \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* having_stood, and had_ not _known that it_is \nd G‹H‹Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a)›H›G\nd*.
\v 15 \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* is_saying to_her: Woman, why are_you_weeping. Whom are_you_seeking. That \add woman\add* supposing that he_is the gardener, is_saying to_him: Sir, if you bore him, tell to_me where you_laid him, and_I will_be_taking_ him _away.
\v 16 \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* is_saying to_her: G‹H‹Maria. that \add woman\add* Having_been_turned is_saying to_him In_G‹Hebraios›G: Rabboni (that is_being_called: Teacher).
\v 17 \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* is_saying to_her: Be_ not _touching against_me, for I_have_ not_yet _gone_up to the father, but be_going to the brothers of_me, and say to_them: I_am_going_up to the father of_me, and \add +the\add*_father of_you_all, and \nd god\nd* of_me, and \nd god\nd* of_you_all.
\v 18 G‹H‹Maria/(Mirəyām)›H›G the G‹from_Magdala›G Is_coming announcing to_the apprentices/followers, I_have_seen the \nd master\nd*, and he_said these \add >things\add* to_her.
\v 19 Therefore being evening on_ that _day first of_\add +the\add*_week, and the doors having_been_shut where the apprentices/followers were because_of the fear of_the G‹Youdaiōns›G, \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* came and stood in the midst, and is_saying to_them: Peace to_you_all.
\v 20 And having_said this, he_showed his hands and his side to_them. Therefore the apprentices/followers were_elated, having_seen the \nd master\nd*.
\v 21 Therefore \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* he_said to_them again: Peace to_you_all, as the father has_sent_ me _out, also_I am_sending you_all.
\v 22 And having_said this, he_breathed_on \add them\add* and is_saying to_them: Receive holy \add +the\add*_\nd spirit\nd*.
\v 23 If of_any you_all_may_forgive the sins, they_have_been_forgiven to_them, if of_any you_all_may_be_restraining, they_have_been_restrained.
\v 24 But G‹Thōmas›G, one of the twelve, the \add >one\add* being_called G‹Didumos/[twin]›G, was not with them when \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* came.
\v 25 Therefore the other apprentices/followers were_saying to_him: We_have_seen the \nd master\nd*. But he said to_them: If I _may_ not _see the mark of_the nails in the hands of_him, and I_may_put the finger of_me into the mark of_the nails, and I_may_put the hand of_me into the side of_him, by_no_means I will_ not _be_believing.
\v 26 And after eight days the apprentices/followers of_him were again inside, and G‹Thōmas›G with them. \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* Is_coming, the doors having_been_shut, and stood in the midst, and said: Peace to_you_all.
\v 27 Thereafter he_is_saying to_G‹Thōmas›G: Be_bringing the finger of_you here, and see the hands of_me, and be_bringing the hand of_you, and put \add it\add* into the side of_me, and be_ not _becoming unbelieving, but believing.
\v 28 G‹Thōmas›G answered and said to_him: The \nd master\nd* of_me and the \nd god\nd* of_me. 
\v 29 \nd G‹H‹Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a)›H›G\nd* is_saying to_him: Because you_have_seen me, have_believed, blessed \add =are\add* the \add >ones\add* not having_seen, and_yet having_believed.
\v 30 Many therefore on_one_hand other signs \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* also did before of_the apprentices/followers of_him, which is not having_been_written in the this scroll.
\v 31 On_the_other_hand these \add >things\add* has_been_written, in_order_that you_all_may_be_believing that \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* is the \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd*, the son of_\nd god\nd*, and in_order_that believing, you_all_may_be_having life in the name of_him.
\c 21
\v 1 After these \add >things\add*, \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* revealed himself again to_the apprentices/followers at the sea of_G‹Tiberios›G, and he_revealed \add himself\add* thus:
\v 2 Rx-G‹Simōn›G-Rx G‹Petros›G, and G‹Thōmas›G being_called G‹Didumos/[twin]›G, and G‹Nathanaēl›G the \add >one\add* from Rx-G‹Kana›G-Rx of_G‹H‹Galilaia/(Gālīl)›H›G, and the \add sons\add* of_G‹Zebedaios›G, and two others of the apprentices/followers of_him. were together.
\v 3 Rx-G‹Simōn›G-Rx G‹Petros›G is_saying to_them: I_am_going to_be_fishing. They_are_saying to_him: We are_ also _coming with you. They_came_out and they_boarded into the boat, and at that night they_caught nothing.
\v 4 But in_the_morning already becoming, \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* stood on the shore, however the apprentices/followers had_ not _known that it_is \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd*.
\v 5 therefore \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* is_saying to_them: Little_children, you_all_are_ not _having any fish. They_answered to_him: No.
\v 6 And he said to_them: Cast the net to the right side of_the boat, and you_all_will_be_finding \add them\add*. Therefore they_throw, and was_ no_longer _able to_drag it because_of the multitude of_the fishes.
\v 7 Therefore apprentice/follower that whom \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* was_loving is_saying to_G‹Petros›G: It_is the \nd master\nd*. Therefore Rx-G‹Simōn›G-Rx G‹Petros›G having_heard that it_is the \nd master\nd*, girded his outer_garment, for he_was naked, and threw himself into the sea.
\v 8 And the other apprentices/followers in_the little_boat came, for they_were not far from the land, but from about two_hundred cubits dragging the net with_the fishes.
\v 9 Therefore when they_got_out on the land, they_are_seeing \add +a\add*_charcoal_fire lying, and fish laying_on \add it\add*, and bread.
\v 10 \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* is_saying to_them: Bring from the fish which you_all_caught now.
\v 11 Therefore Rx-G‹Simōn›G-Rx G‹Petros›G went_up, and dragged the net to land full of_ large _fishes \add +a\add*_hundred fifty three, but being so_many, the net was_ not _torn.
\v 12 \nd G‹H‹Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a)›H›G\nd* is_saying to_them: Come, eat_breakfast. But no_one of_the apprentices/followers was_daring to_question him, who are You. Having_known that it_is the \nd master\nd*.
\v 13 \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* is_coming, and is_taking the bread and is_giving to_them, and the fish likewise.
\v 14 This now \add +the\add*_third \add time\add* \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* was_revealed to_the apprentices/followers, having_been_raised from \add +the\add*_dead.
\v 15 Therefore when they_ate_lunch, \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* is_saying to_Rx-G‹Simōn›G-Rx G‹Petros›G: Rx-G‹Simōn›G-Rx \add son\add* of_G‹Yōannēs›G, are_you_loving me more \add =than\add* these. He_is_saying to_him: Yes, \nd master\nd*, you have_known that I_am_loving you. He_is_saying to_him: Be_feeding the lambs of_me.
\v 16 He_is_saying to_him again secondly: Rx-G‹Simōn›G-Rx \add son\add* of_G‹Yōannēs›G, are_you_loving me. He_is_saying to_him: Yes, \nd master\nd*, you have_known that I_am_loving you. He_is_saying to_him: Be_shepherding the sheep of_me.
\v 17 He_is_saying to_him the third \add time\add*: Rx-G‹Simōn›G-Rx \add son\add* of_G‹Yōannēs›G, are_you_loving me. G‹Petros›G was_sorrowed because he_said to_him the third \add time\add*: Are_you_loving me. And he_is_saying to_him: \nd master\nd*, you have_known all \add >things\add*, you are_knowing that I_am_loving you. \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* is_saying to_him: Be_feeding the sheep of_me.
\v 18 Truly, truly, I_am_saying to_you, when you_were younger, you_were_girding yourself, and you_were_walking where you_were_wanting, but whenever you_may_age, you_will_be_stretching_out the hands of_you, and others will_be_girding you, and will_be_bringing where you_are_ not _wanting.
\v 19 And he_said this, signifying by_what death he_will_be_glorifying \nd god\nd*. And having_said this, he_is_saying to_him: Be_following after_me.
\v 20 Having_been_turned_back, G‹Petros›G is_seeing the apprentice/follower whom \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* was_loving who also sat_down at the supper on the chest of_him following, and said, to_him: \nd master\nd*, who is, the \add >one\add* giving_ you _over. 
\v 21 Therefore having_seen this \add >one\add*, G‹Petros›G is_saying to_\nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd*: \nd master\nd*, and what \add about\add* this \add >one\add*. 
\v 22 \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* is_saying to_him: If I_may_be_wanting him to_be_remaining until I_am_coming, what \add is_it\add* to you. You be_following after_me. 
\v 23 Therefore this statement came_out among the brothers, that that apprentice/follower is_dying_off. Not but \nd G‹H‹Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a)›H›G\nd* not said to_him that He_is_ not _dying_off, but \add only\add*: If I_may_be_wanting him to_be_remaining until I_am_coming, what \add is_it\add* to you. 
\v 24 This \add >one\add* is the apprentice/follower testifying concerning these \add >things\add*, and the \add >one\add* having_written these \add >things\add*, and we_have_known that the testimony of_him is true.
\v 25 And is also many other \add >things\add* that \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* did, which if in_every one may_be_being_written, I_am_supposing not_even the world itself going_to_be_having_room for_the scrolls being_written.
