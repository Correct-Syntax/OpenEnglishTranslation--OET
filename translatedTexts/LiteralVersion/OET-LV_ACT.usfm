\v 1 Indeed the first account I_made concerning all \add >things\add*, oh Theophilus, of_which Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a) began both to_be_doing and to_be_teaching,
\v 2 until which day having_commanded by \add +the_\add* holy _spirit to_the ambassadors, whom he_chose, he_was_taken_up;
\v 3 to_whom also after the \add time\add* him to_suffer he_presented himself living, with many proofs through forty days, appearing to_them, and speaking the \add >things\add* concerning the kingdom of_god.
\v 4 And assembling_together, he_commanded to_them: From Hierousalēm/(Yərūshālam) not to_be_being_departed, but to_be_awaiting the promise of_the father, which you_all_heard from_me.
\v 5 Because Yōannēs on_one_hand immersed with_water, on_the_other_hand you_all will_be_being_immersed with \add +the_\add* holy _spirit, after many not these days.
\v 6 Therefore indeed the \add >ones\add* having_come_together, were_asking him saying: master, at this time, are_you_restoring the kingdom to_Israēl/(Yisərā'ēl). 
\v 7 And he_said to them: It_is not of_you_all to_know times or seasons, which the father set by his own authority.
\v 8 But you_all_will_be_receiving power, having_ The holy spirit _come_over on you_all, and you_all_will_be witnesses for_me, in both Hierousalēm, and in all Youdaia, and Samaria, and to \add +the_\add*last \add part\add* of_the earth.
\v 9 And having_said these \add >things\add*, seeing them, he_was_lifted_up and \add +a_\add*cloud took_ him _up from the eyes of_them.
\v 10 And as they_were looking_intently into the sky, him going, also behold two men in white clothing, had_stood_by to_them,
\v 11 who also said: Men, Galilaios, why you_all_have_stood looking at the sky. This Yēsous having_been_taken_up from you_all into heaven, thus will_be_coming which manner you_all_saw him going into heaven.
\v 12 Then they_returned to Hierousalēm from \add +the_\add*mountain being_called of_Olivet, which is near Hierousalēm, having journey of_\add +a_\add*sabbath.
\v 13 And when they_came_in, into the upper_room, they_went_up where they_were staying, jointly Petros and Yōannēs and Yakōbos/(Ya'aqov) and Andreas, Filippos and Thōmas, Bartholomaios and Matthaios, Yakōbos of_Alfaios, and Simōn the Zealot, and Youdas/(Yəhūdāh) of_Yakōbos.
\v 14 These all were persevering in_prayer with_one_accord, with \add +the_\add*women and Maria/(Mirəyām) the mother of_Yēsous, and the brothers of_him.
\v 15 And in these days, Petros having_stood_up in \add +the_\add*midst of_the brothers said (and \add +the_\add*crowd of_names with the same was about \add +a_\add*hundred twenty),
\v 16 Men, brothers, it_was_fitting the scripture to_be_fulfilled, which the holy spirit previously_said by \add +the_\add*mouth of_Dauid/(Ddāvid) concerning Youdas, the \add >one\add* having_become guide to_the \add >ones\add* having_captured Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a).
\v 17 Because he_was having_been_numbered with us, and obtained \add +a_\add*lot of_ this _service.
\v 18 (Therefore indeed this \add man\add* acquired \add +a_\add*field out_of \add +the_\add*reward of_unrighteousness, and having_become headlong, he_burst_open in_\add +the_\add*middle, and all the intestines of_him was_poured_out.
\v 19 And it_became known to_all the \add >ones\add* dwelling_in Hierousalēm/(Yərūshālam), so_that that field to_be_called in_their language of_them, Akeldamach, this is: field of_blood.)
\v 20 For it_has_been_written in scroll of_Psalms, the \add +the_\add*homestead of_him let_be_become desolate, and let_ not _be the \add >one\add* dwelling in it, and: let_ another _take the overseeing of_him.
\v 21 Therefore it_is_fitting of_the men having_come_together with_us, at all \add +the_\add*time that the master Yēsous came_in and came_out with us,
\v 22 having_begun from the immersion of_Yōannēs until the day in_which he_was_taken_up from us, \add +a_\add*witness of_the resurrection of_him with us, to_become one of_these.
\v 23 And they_set two, Yōsēf/(Yōşēf) being_called Barsabbas, who was_called Youstos, and Matthias.
\v 24 And having_prayed, they_said: You master, heart_knower of_all, reveal which one you_chose of these two,
\v 25 to_take the this place of_service and commission, from which Youdas broke_from, to_be_gone to his own place.
\v 26 And they_gave lots to_them, and the lot fell on Matthias, and he_was_chosen_together_with with the eleven ambassadors.
\c 2
\v 1 And at the \add time\add* the day of_pentecost to_be_being_fulfilled, they_were all together in the same \add place\add*.
\v 2 And suddenly \add +a_\add*sound became out_of heaven, as being_carried of_\add +a_\add* forceful _wind, and it_filled all the house where they_were sitting.
\v 3 And dividing tongues as_if of_fire were_seen to_them, and sat_down on each one of_them.
\v 4 And they_were_ all _filled with_\add +the_\add* holy _spirit, and they_began to_be_speaking with_other tongues, as the spirit was_giving to_them to_be_speaking_out.
\v 5 And Jews were dwelling in Hierousalēm, devout men from every nation of_the \add nations\add* under heaven.
\v 6 And of_ this _sound having_become, the multitude came_together and was_confounded, because each one heard speaking of_them in_his. own language.
\v 7 And they_were_amazed and they_were_marvelling saying: Behold are not, all these who \add =are\add* speaking Galilaios. 
\v 8 And how are_ we _hearing each in_the own language of_us, in which we_were_born. 
\v 9 Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the \add >ones\add* dwelling_in Mesopotamia, Youdaia and jointly Kappadokia, Pontos and Asia,
\v 10 Phrygia and jointly Pamphylia, Aiguptos/(Miʦərayim), and the parts of_Libya along Cyrene, and the \add >ones\add* Romans visiting,
\v 11 both Jews and converts, Krēs and Arabs– we_are_hearing them speaking, the great \add >things\add* of_god in_our tongues.
\v 12 And all were_marvelling and were_thoroughly_perplexed, another saying to another: What is_wanting this to_be. 
\v 13 But others mocking were_saying, They_are having_been_filled of_sweet_wine.
\v 14 But Petros having_been_stood with the eleven, lifted_up the voice of_him and spoke_out to_them: Men, Youdaians, and all you_all dwelling_in Hierousalēm/(Yərūshālam), let_ this _be known to_you_all and give_ear to_the words of_me.
\v 15 For these are_ not _being_drunk as you_all are_supposing, for it_is \add +the_\add* third _hour, of_the day,
\v 16 but this is the \add word\add* having_been_spoken by the prophet Joel:
\v 17 and it_will_be with these \add >things\add* in the last days, god is_saying: I_will_be_pouring_out of the spirit of_me on all flesh, and the sons of_you_all will_be_prophesying, and the daughters of_you_all, and the young_men of_you_all will_be_seeing visions, and the elders of_you_all in_dreams will_be_being_dreamt;
\v 18 and surely I_will_be_pouring_out of the spirit of_me on the slaves of_me, and on the handmaidens of_me, in those days, and they_will_be_prophesying.
\v 19 And I_will_be_giving wonders in the sky above, and signs on the earth below, blood, and fire, and vapor of_smoke.
\v 20 The sun will_be_being_altered into darkness and the moon into blood, before \add +the_\add* great and glorious _day of_\add +the_\add*master to_come.
\v 21 And it_will_be, everyone who may_call on_the name of_\add +the_\add*master will_be_being_saved.
\v 22 Men, Israēl/(Yisərā'ēl)ites, hear words these: Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a) the Nazarene, \add +a_\add*man having_been_demonstrated by god to you_all by_miracles, and wonders, and signs, which god did by him in \add +the_\add*midst of_you_all, as you_all_ yourselves _have_known.
\v 23 This \add man\add* by_the, having_been_designated counsel and foreknowledge of_god, delivered_up by \add +the_\add*hand of_\add +the_\add*lawless \add >ones\add*, you_all_killed having_crucified.
\v 24 Whom god raised_up, having_loosed the agonies of_the death, as_much_as was not possible him to_be_being_restrained by it.
\v 25 For Dauid/(Ddāvid) is_saying to him: I_was_foreseeing the master before me through all \add time\add*, because he_is on \add +the_\add*right \add hand\add* of_me, in_order_that I _may_ not _be_shaken.
\v 26 Because_of this the heart of_me was_gladdened, and the tongue of_me exulted, and still also the flesh of_me will_be_nesting in hope;
\v 27 because you will_ not _be_abandoning the soul of_me into Hadēs, nor will_you_be_giving the Devout \add One\add* of_you to_see decay.
\v 28 You_made_known to_me \add +the_\add*ways of_life, you_will_be_filling me with_gladness with the presence of_you.
\v 29 Men, brothers, it_is_permitting to_speak with confidence to you_all concerning the patriarch Dauid that he_ both _died and was_buried, and the tomb of_him is among us until this day.
\v 30 Therefore being \add +a_\add*prophet, and having_known that god swore to_him with_\add +an_\add*oath: of \add +the_\add*fruit of_the loin of_him, to_sit_down on the throne of_him.
\v 31 Having_foreseen, he_spoke concerning the resurrection of_the messiah that neither was_abandoned into Hadēs, nor the flesh of_him saw decay.
\v 32 This Yēsous god raised_up, of_which all we are witnesses.
\v 33 Therefore having_been_exalted by_the right \add hand\add* of_god, and having_received the promise of_the holy spirit, from the father, he_poured_ this _out which you_all are_seeing and are_hearing.
\v 34 For Dauid not went_up into the heavens, but himself is_saying, \add +the_\add*master said to_the master of_me: Be_sitting on \add +the_\add*right \add hand\add* of_me,
\v 35 until I_may_put the enemies of_you \add +a_\add*footstool of_the feet of_you.
\v 36 Assuredly therefore let_ All \add +the_\add*house of_Israēl _be_knowing that god made him both \add +the_\add*master and \add +the_\add*messiah, this Yēsous whom you_all crucified.
\v 37 And having_heard, they_were_pierced to_the heart, and they_said to Petros and the other ambassadors: What may_we_do, men, brothers. 
\v 38 And Petros is_saying to them: Repent: and let_ each of_you_all _be_immersed in the name of_Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a) messiah, for forgiveness of_the sins of_you_all, and you_all_will_be_receiving the gift of_the holy spirit.
\v 39 For the promise is to_you_all, and to_the children of_you_all, and to_all the \add >ones\add* at far, as_many_as may_call_to \add +the_\add*master, the god of_us.
\v 40 Both with_ more _other words he_testified, and was_exhorting them saying: Be_saved from this crooked generation.
\v 41 Therefore indeed the \add >ones\add* having_welcomed the word of_him were_immersed, and were_added on that day, about three_thousand souls.
\v 42 And they_were persevering in_the teaching of_the ambassadors, and in_fellowship, the breaking of_the bread, and in_prayers.
\v 43 And reverence was_becoming on_every soul, and many wonders and signs was_becoming through the ambassadors. in Hierousalēm/(Yərūshālam). and great fear was with all.
\v 44 and And all the \add >ones\add* having_believed were with the same \add purpose\add*, and they_were_having all common \add >things\add*,
\v 45 and they_were_selling their properties and their possessions, and they_were_dividing them to_all, anyone was_having as_much_as would need.
\v 46 And in_every day persevering with_one_accord in the temple, and breaking bread in_every house, they_were_partaking of_food with exultation and simplicity of_heart,
\v 47 praising god and having favor with all the people. And the master was_adding the \add >ones\add* being_saved with the same. in_every day.

\v 1 And Petros also Yōannēs were_going_up into the temple at the hour of_prayer the ninth \add hour\add*.
\v 2 And \add +a_\add*certain man, being lame from \add +the_\add*womb of_\add +the_\add*mother of_him, was_being_born, whom they_were_putting in_every day at the door of_the temple, being_called Beautiful, to_be_requesting alms from the \add >ones\add* entering_in into the temple.
\v 3 Who having_seen Petros and Yōannēs going to_be_entering into the temple, was_asking to_receive alms.
\v 4 But Petros having_looked_intently at him with Yōannēs said: Look to us.
\v 5 And he was_holding_on to_them, expecting to_receive something from them.
\v 6 But Petros said: Silver and gold is_ not _being to_me, but this what I_am_having, I_am_giving to_you– in the name of_Yēsous messiah of_the Nazarene, be_walking. 
\v 7 And having_grabbed him by_the right hand, he_raised him; and immediately the feet of_him and the ankles were_strengthened.
\v 8 And leaping_up, he_stood and was_walking, and came_in with them into the temple, walking, and springing_up, and praising god.
\v 9 And all the people saw him walking and praising the god.
\v 10 And they_were_recognizing him that he was the \add >one\add* sitting at the Beautiful Gate of_the temple for the alms, and they_were_filled with_amazement and amazement at the \add >thing\add* having_been_happened to_him.
\v 11 And of_him taking_hold_of Petros and Yōannēs, all the people ran_together to them in the portico being_called of_Solomōn/(Shəlmoh), greatly_amazed.
\v 12 But Petros having_seen \add it\add*, answered to the people: Men, Israēl/(Yisərā'ēl)ites, why you_all_are_wondering at this, or why you_all_are_looking_intently at_us, as_though by_/our/_own power or devoutness having_made him to_be_walking. 
\v 13 The god of_Abra'am/('Avərāhām), and the \add +the_\add*god of_Isa'ak/(Yiʦəḩāq), and the \add +the_\add*god of_Yakōb/(Ya'aqov), the god of_the fathers of_us, glorified the servant of_him, Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a), whom you_all indeed gave_over, and disowned in \add +the_\add*presence of_Pilatos, that \add >one\add* having_judged to_be_sending_away \add ~him\add*.
\v 14 But you_all disowned the holy \add >one\add* and Righteous \add One\add*, and you_all_requested \add +a_\add*man \add +a_\add*murderer to_be_granted to_you_all,
\v 15 but you_all_killed_off the Originator of_life, whom god raised from \add +the_\add*dead, of_which we are witnesses.
\v 16 And faith in_the name of_him, this \add man\add* whom you_all_are_observing and you_all_have_known, strengthened the name of_him, and the faith which \add =is\add* by him, gave complete_healing to_him this in_front_of all of_you_all.
\v 17 And now, brothers, I_have_known that you_all_did in ignorance, as also the rulers of_you_all.
\v 18 But what \add >things\add* god foretold by \add +the_\add*mouth of_all the prophets, the messiah of_him to_suffer, he_fulfilled thus.
\v 19 Therefore repent and turn_back, for the \add time\add* of_you_all sins to_be_wiped_out,
\v 20 so_that times of_refreshment may_come from \add +the_\add*presence of_the master, and he_may_send_out the \add >one\add* having_been_appointed to_you_all \add +the_\add*messiah Yēsous,
\v 21 whom indeed it_is_fitting heaven to_receive, until \add +the_\add*times of_restoration of_all \add >things\add*, which god spoke from \add +the_\add*age by \add +the_\add*mouth of_the holy prophets of_him.
\v 22 Indeed Mōsēs/(Mosheh) said, \add +the_\add*master, the god of_us will_be_raising_up \add +a_\add*prophet to_you_all like of_you_all me from the brothers, you_all_will_be_hearing from_him in all \add >things\add*, as_many_as he_may_speak to you_all.
\v 23 And it_will_be \add that\add* every soul, whoever may_ not _hear from_ that _prophet, will_be_being_wholly_destroyed from the people.
\v 24 And also all the prophets from Samuel and the \add >ones\add* consecutively, as_many_as spoke, also proclaimed these days.
\v 25 You_all are the sons of_the prophets, and of_the covenant which god covenanted with the fathers of_you_all, saying to Abra'am: and in the seed of_you all the families of_the earth will_be_being_blessed.
\v 26 god having_raised_up the servant of_him, sent_ him _out To_you_all first, blessing you_all in that to_be_turning_away each from the wickedness of_you_all.

\v 1 And of_them speaking to the people, the chief_priests, and the officer of_the temple, and the Saddoukaios_sect approached to_them,
\v 2 being_thoroughly_disturbing because_of the \add >thing\add* them to_be_teaching to_the people, and to_be_proclaiming the resurrection in Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a), which \add =is\add* from \add +the_\add*dead.
\v 3 And they_laid_ their _on on_them hands, and they_put \add them\add* in jail to the_ next _\add day\add*, for it_was already evening.
\v 4 But many the \add >ones\add* having_heard the word, believed and number of_the men was_become about five thousands.
\v 5 And it_became on the_ next _\add day\add* the rulers of_them, and the elders, and the scribes to_be_gathered_together in Hierousalēm/(Yərūshālam),
\v 6 and Annas the chief_priest, and Kaiafas, and Yōannēs, and Alexandros, and as_many_as were of chief_priestly descent.
\v 7 And having_stood them in the midst, they_were_inquiring: In what power or in what name you_all did this. 
\v 8 Then Petros having_been_filled with_\add +the_\add* holy _spirit, said to them: Rulers of_the people and elders,
\v 9 if we today are_being_examined on \add +a_\add*good_work to_\add +the_\add* sick _man, by what this \add >one\add* has_been_healed,
\v 10 it_let_be known to_all you_all and to_all the people of_Israēl/(Yisərā'ēl), that in the name of_Yēsous messiah the Nazarene, whom you_all crucified, whom god raised from \add +the_\add*dead, by this \add name\add* this \add man\add* has_stood_by before you_all healthy.
\v 11 This \add >one\add* is the stone having_been_scorned by you_all, the builders, which having_become to \add +the_\add*head of_\add +the_\add*corner.
\v 12 And not_one the is not in other salvation, for there_is not another name under heaven having_been_given among people, by which it_is_fitting us to_be_saved.
\v 13 And observing the boldness of_Petros and of_Yōannēs, and having_grasped that they_are illiterate and ordinary men, they_were_marvelling, and they_were_recognizing them that they_were with Yēsous.
\v 14 And seeing the man having_stood with them, the \add >one\add* having_been_healed, they_were_having nothing to_speak_against \add them\add*.
\v 15 But having_commanded them to_go_away outside the Sanhedrin, they_were_conferring with one_another
\v 16 saying: What we_may_do to_ these _men. For indeed that has_become \add +a_\add*known sign through them, to_all the \add >ones\add* dwelling_in Hierousalēm \add =is\add* manifest, and we_are_ not _being_able to_be_disowning \add it\add*.
\v 17 But in_order_that may_ not _be_spread on more among the people, we_may_threaten to_them to_ no_longer _be_speaking in this name to_no_one of_\add +the_\add*people.
\v 18 And having_called them, they_commanded \add them\add* not to_be_speaking nor to_be_teaching in the name of_Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a) at_all.
\v 19 But Petros and Yōannēs answering said to them: Judge whether it_is right before god, to_be_hearing from_you_all rather than from_god.
\v 20 For we are_ not _being_able to_be_ not _speaking what we_saw and we_heard.
\v 21 And they having_further_threatened \add them\add* sent_ them _away, finding nothing how they_may_punish them, because_of the people, because all were_glorifying god for the \add >thing\add* having_become.
\v 22 For the man on whom this sign of_the healing had_become was more years \add =than\add* forty.
\v 23 And having_been_sent_away, they_came to their own, and they_reported as_much_as the chief_priests and the elders said to them.
\v 24 And which having_heard, with_one_accord lifted_up \add ^their_\add*voice to god and said: Master, you having_made the heaven, and the earth, and the sea, and all the \add >things\add* in them,
\v 25 the \add >one\add* of_the father of_us, by \add +the_\add* holy _spirit of_\add +the_\add*mouth Dauid/(Ddāvid) servant of_you having_said: for_ why _reason \add +the_\add*pagans raged, and peoples pondered new \add >things\add*. 
\v 26 Standing_before the kings of_the earth and the rulers were_gathered_together with themselves against the master, and against the messiah of_him.
\v 27 For both Hērōdēs and Pontios Pilatos were_gathered_together in truth in this city with \add +the_\add*pagans and peoples of_Israēl/(Yisərā'ēl) against the holy servant of_you Yēsous, whom you_anointed,
\v 28 to_do as_much_as the hand of_you, and the counsel of_you predetermined to_become.
\v 29 And the \add >things\add* now, master, look_upon on the threats of_them, and give to_the slaves of_you, all to_be_speaking the of_you word with boldness,
\v 30 in that the hand to_be_stretching_out to_you for healing, and signs, and wonders, to_be_becoming through the name of_the holy servant of_you, Yēsous.
\v 31 And having_been_besought of_them, the place in which they_were having_been_gathered_together was_shaken, and all were_filled the holy spirit, and they_were_speaking the word of_god with boldness.
\v 32 And the multitude of_the \add >ones\add* having_believed, was one in_heart and soul, and not_even one anything of_the \add >things\add* possessing to_him was_saying to_be \add ^his_\add*own, but was all \add >things\add* in_common to_them.
\v 33 And with_ great _power, the ambassadors of_the master Yēsous were_giving_back , testimony, of_the resurrection, and great grace was on them all.
\v 34 For not_even any impoverished was among them; for as_many_as were_being owners of_properties or houses, selling \add them\add* they_were_bringing the values of_the \add >things\add* being_sold,
\v 35 and they_were_laying \add them\add* before the feet of_the ambassadors; and it_was_being_distributed to_each, as_much_as anyone was_having need.
\v 36 And Yōsēf/(Yōşēf) the \add >one\add* having_been_called Barnabas, by the ambassadors, which is being_translated: son of_exhortation, \add +a_\add*Levite, \add +a_\add*Cyprian by_descent,
\v 37 possessing by_him of_\add +a_\add*field, having_sold \add it\add* brought the money and laid \add it\add* before the feet of_the ambassadors.
\c 5
\v 1 But \add +a_\add*certain man by_\add +the_\add*name Ananias, with Sapphira the wife of_him, sold \add +a_\add*property
\v 2 and embezzled from the value, the wife also having_become_aware, and having_brought \add +a_\add*certain portion, he_laid \add it\add* before the feet of_the ambassadors.
\v 3 But Petros said: Ananias, for_ Why _reason Satan/(Sāţān) filled the heart of_you, for_you to_lie to_the holy spirit, and to_embezzle from the value of_the property. 
\v 4 Not remaining \add unsold\add* it_was_remaining to_you, and having_been_sold it_was_being in your authority. Why that you_purposed in the heart of_you this matter. You_lied not to_people, but to_god.
\v 5 And Ananias hearing these words, having_fallen he_stopped_breathing. And great fear became on all the \add >ones\add* hearing.
\v 6 And having_risen_up, the younger \add men\add* covered him, and having_brought_out \add ~him\add*, they_buried \add ~him\add*.
\v 7 And it_became \add +a_\add*period about three hours, and the wife of_him, not having_known the \add >thing\add* having_become, came_in.
\v 8 And Petros answered to her: Tell to_me if for_so_much the property and. you_all_gave_back she said: Yes, for_so_much.
\v 9 But Petros \add said\add* to her: Why \add is_it\add* that it_was_agreed_together by_you_all to_test the spirit of_\add +the_\add*master. Behold, the feet of_the \add >ones\add* having_buried the husband of_you \add =are\add* at the door, and they_will_be_bringing_ you _out.
\v 10 And immediately she_fell before the feet of_him, and stopped_breathing. And having_come_in, the young_men found her dead, and having_brought_out \add her\add*, they_buried \add her\add* with the husband of_her.
\v 11 And great reverence became on all the assembly, and on all the \add >ones\add* hearing these \add >things\add*.
\v 12 And by the hands of_the ambassadors, many signs and wonders was_becoming; among the people; and all were with_one_accord in the Portico of_Solomōn/(Shəlmoh).
\v 13 But of_the rest no_one was_daring to_be_being_joined_together to_them, but the people was_magnifying them,
\v 14 and more believing \add >ones\add* were_being_added in_the master, multitudes of_ both _men and women;
\v 15 so_as even to_be_bringing_out the sick on the roads, and to_be_putting \add them\add* on cots and pallets, in_order_that coming of_Petros, even_if the shadow may_overshadow on_someone of_them.
\v 16 And the multitude was_coming_together also from_the surrounding \add +the_\add*cities of_Hierousalēm/(Yərūshālam), bringing \add +the_\add*sick and being_being_tormented \add >ones\add* by unclean spirits, who /were_ all _being_healed.
\v 17 But the chief_priest and all the \add >ones\add* with him, being the sect of_the Saddoukaios_sect having_risen_up, were_filled with_jealousy,
\v 18 and they_laid_on their hands on the ambassadors, and they_put them in public jail.
\v 19 But \add +an_\add*angel of_\add +the_\add*master opened_up the doors of_the prison through, \add +the_\add*night, and having_led_ them _out said,
\v 20 Be_going, and having_been_stood, in the temple be_speaking to_the people all the words of_ this _life.
\v 21 And having_heard, they_came_in by dawn into the temple, and they_were_teaching. And having_arrived the chief_priest and the \add >ones\add* with him, they_called_together the Sanhedrin and all the Sanhedrin of_the sons of_Israēl/(Yisərā'ēl), and they_sent_out to the prison for_them to_be_brought.
\v 22 But they having_arrived attendants, not found them in the prison, and having_returned, they_reported
\v 23 saying, We_found the \add +the_\add*prison having_been_shut with all security, and the guards having_stood before the doors, but having_opened_up, we_found no_one inside.
\v 24 And when they_heard these words, both the officer of_the temple and the chief_priests were_thoroughly_perplexing concerning them, what this might_become.
\v 25 But having_arrived, someone reported to_them, Behold, the men whom you_all_put in the prison are in the temple, having_stood and teaching the people. 
\v 26 Then having_gone_away, the officer with the attendants was_bringing them, not with force, for they_were_fearing the people, lest they_may_be_stoned.
\v 27 And having_brought them, they_set \add them\add* in the Sanhedrin. And the chief_priest asked them
\v 28 saying, we_commanded to_you_all ˱By˲_\add +a_\add*charge not to_be_teaching in this name, and behold, you_all_have_filled Hierousalēm with_the teaching of_you_all, and you_all_are_wishing to_bring_upon on us the blood of_ this _man.
\v 29 But Petros and the ambassadors answering said: /To_be_yielding it_is_fitting to_god, rather than people.
\v 30 The god of_the fathers of_us raised Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a), whom you_all handed_over, having_hanged \add ~him\add* on \add +a_\add*cross.
\v 31 god exalted This \add >one\add* Originator and saviour, by_the right \add hand\add* of_him, to_give repentance to_Israēl and forgiveness of_sins.
\v 32 And we are witnesses of_ these _words, and the holy spirit, whom god gave to_the \add >ones\add* yielding to_him.
\v 33 And they having_heard were_being_cut_through, and they_were_wishing to_kill them.
\v 34 But \add +a_\add*certain Farisaios_sect_member by_\add +the_\add*name Gamaliel having_risen_up in the Sanhedrin, \add +a_\add*law_teacher honored by_all the people, he_commanded \add them\add* to_make the men. outside \add +a_\add*little \add time\add*.
\v 35 And he_said to them: Men, Israēlites, be_taking_heed to_yourselves what you_all_are_going to_be_doing with these men.
\v 36 For before these days Theudas rose_up, saying himself to_be someone, to_whom was_joined_up of_men \add +a_\add*number of_ about _four_hundred; who was_killed and all as_many_as were_being_persuaded by_him were_dispersed and became to nothing.
\v 37 After this, Youdas/(Yəhūdāh) the Galilaios rose_up in the days of_the registration, and drew_away people after him; and_that \add >one\add* perished, and all as_many_as were_being_persuaded by_him were_scattered.
\v 38 And now I_am_saying the \add >things\add* to_you_all, withdraw from these men and allow them, because if this counsel or this work it_may_be from humans, will_be_being_torn_down,
\v 39 but if it_is from god, you_all will_ not _be_able to_tear_down them, lest also you_all_may_be_found god-opposers. And they_were_persuaded by_him,
\v 40 and having_called_to the ambassadors, having_beat they_commanded \add them\add* not to_be_speaking in the name of_Yēsous, and they_sent_away \add them\add*.
\v 41 Therefore they indeed were_going, rejoicing from \add +the_\add*presence of_the Sanhedrin that they_were_considered_worthy to_be_dishonored for his name.
\v 42 And every day in the temple and in /each/_house, they_were_ not _ceasing teaching and gospel_preaching the messiah, Yēsous.
\c 6
\v 1 And in these days multiplying the disciples, became \add +a_\add*grumbling of_the Hellenists against the Hebrews, because the widows of_them were_being_overlooked in the daily service.
\v 2 And the twelve having_called_to the multitude of_the disciples said: It_is not pleasing us, having_left the word of_god, to_be_serving unto_tables.
\v 3 but brothers examine, men from of_you_all being_attested, seven full of_\add +the_\add*spirit and wisdom, whom we_will_be_appointing over this need.
\v 4 But we will_be_persevering in_prayer and service of_the word.
\v 5 And the statement brought_pleasure before all the multitude, and they_chose Stephen, \add +a_\add*man full of_faith and of_\add +the_\add* holy _spirit, and Filippos, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas \add +a_\add* Antioⱪeiaene _convert,
\v 6 whom they_stood before the ambassadors, and having_prayed, they_laid_on their hands on_them.
\v 7 And the word of_the of_god was_growing, and the number of_the disciples in Hierousalēm/(Yərūshālam) was_being_multiplied exceedingly, and \add +a_\add*great crowd of_the priests were_submitting in_the faith.
\v 8 And Stephen full of_grace and power, was_doing wonders and great signs among the people.
\v 9 But some of_the of the synagogue, being_called Freedmen, and of_Cyrenians, and of_Alexandrians, and of_the \add >ones\add* from Cilicia, and Asia rose_up, debating with_the Stephen.
\v 10 And they_were_were_ not _able to_resist against_the wisdom and the spirit, by_whom he_was_speaking.
\v 11 Then they_instigated men saying, We_have_heard him speaking slanderous words against Mōsēs/(Mosheh) and god.
\v 12 And they_stirred_up the people, and the elders, and the scribes, and having_approached, they_seized him and brought \add ~him\add* to the Sanhedrin,
\v 13 and they_set false witnesses saying: this man is_ not _ceasing speaking words against this the holy place and the law,
\v 14 for we_have_heard him saying that this Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a) the Nazarene will_be_tearing_down this place, and will_be_changing the customs that Mōsēs gave_over to_us.
\v 15 And having_looked_intently at him, all the \add >ones\add* sitting in the Sanhedrin saw the face of_him, as_if \add +the_\add*face of_\add +an_\add*angel.
\c 7
\v 1 And the chief_priest said: these \add >things\add* is_having thus. 
\v 2 And he was_saying: Men, brothers and fathers, hear \add me\add*. The god of_glory was_seen by_ Abra'am/('Avərāhām) _the father of_us, him being in Mesopotamia before to_dwell in Haran,
\v 3 and he_said to him: come_out from the land of_you and from the relatives of_you, and come into the land whichever I_will_be_showing to_you.
\v 4 Then having_come_out from \add +the_\add*land of_Chaldeans, he_dwelt in Haran. And_from_there after the \add time\add* the father of_him to_die_off, he_removed him into this land, in which you_all are_ now _dwelling.
\v 5 And not gave to_him \add +an_\add*inheritance in it, nor \add +the_\add*tribunal of_\add +a_\add*foot, but he_promised to_give to_him for \add +a_\add*possession it, and to_the descendants of_him after him, not being to_him \add +a_\add*child.
\v 6 But god spoke thus that will_be the descendants of_him: \add +a_\add*sojourner in another's land, and they_will_be_enslaving it and they_will_be_mistreating \add it\add* four_hundred years.
\v 7 But I god will_be_judging the nation for_whichever they_may_serve, said: and after these \add >things\add*, they_will_be_coming_out and will_be_serving unto_me in this place.
\v 8 And he_gave to_him \add +the_\add*covenant of_circumcision; and thus he_bore Isa'ak/(Yiʦəḩāq), and circumcised him on_the eighth day, and Isa'ak \add bore\add* Yakōb/(Ya'aqov), and Twelve the Yakōb patriarchs.
\v 9 And the patriarchs having_been_jealous of_Yōsēf/(Yōşēf), gave_back \add ~him\add* into Aiguptos/(Miʦərayim); but god was with him,
\v 10 and he_rescued him out_of all the tribulations of_him, and gave to_him favor and wisdom before Pharaoh, king of_Aiguptos, and he_appointed him leading \add >one\add* over Aiguptos, and over all the house of_him.
\v 11 And \add +a_\add*famine came on all the Aiguptos and Canaan, and great tribulation, and the fathers of_us were_ not _finding food.
\v 12 But Yakōb having_heard, being grain in Aiguptos, sent_away the fathers of_us first.
\v 13 And on the second \add time\add*, Yōsēf was_made_known by_the brothers of_him, and the descent of_Yōsēf it_became manifest to_Pharaoh.
\v 14 And Yōsēf having_sent_out, summoned Yakōb, the father of_him, and all the relatives, in seventy five souls.
\v 15 And Yakōb came_down into Aiguptos, and he and the fathers of_us died,
\v 16 and they_were_replaced to Shechem, and they_were_put in the tomb, which Abra'am purchased for_\add +a_\add*value of_silver from the sons of_Emmor in Shechem.
\v 17 But as the time of_the promise, which god promised to_Abra'am was_nearing, the people grew and was_multiplied in Aiguptos,
\v 18 until of_which another king rose_up over Aiguptos, who had_ not _known Yōsēf.
\v 19 He, having_taken_advantage of_the race of_us, mistreated the fathers to_be_making the babies of_them abandoned, in_order that to_ not _be_being_kept_alive.
\v 20 In that time Mōsēs/(Mosheh) was_born, and he_was beautiful to_god; who was_brought_up three months in the house of_the father.
\v 21 And, having_been_set_out of_him the daughter of_Pharaoh took_ him _away, and brought_ him _up for_herself for \add +a_\add*son.
\v 22 And Mōsēs was_instructed in in_all \add +the_\add*wisdom of_\add +the_\add*Aiguptosians, and was powerful in \add +the_\add*words and \add +the_\add*works of_him.
\v 23 But when \add +a_\add* forty_year _time was_being_fulfilled to_him, went_up in the heart of_him to_visit the brothers of_him, the sons of_Israēl/(Yisərā'ēl).
\v 24 And having_seen one being_wronged, he_retaliated and did vengeance for_the \add >one\add* being_distressed, having_struck the Aiguptosian.
\v 25 And he_was_thinking the brothers to_be_understanding that god by \add +the_\add*hand of_him is_giving salvation to_them, but they not understood.
\v 26 And on_the following day, he_was_seen to_them quarrelling, and he_was_reconciling them to peace, having_said: Men, you_all_are brothers. for_ Why _reason are_you_all_injuring one_another. 
\v 27 But the \add >one\add* injuring your neighbor pushed_ him _away having_said: who appointed you ruler and judge over us. 
\v 28 You are_ not _wanting to_kill me, which manner you_killed the Aiguptos/(Miʦərayim)ian yesterday. 
\v 29 And Mōsēs fled at this statement: and became \add +a_\add*sojourner in \add +the_\add*land of_Midian, where he_bore two sons.
\v 30 And forty years having_been_fulfilled: \add +an_\add*angel was_seen to_him in the desert of_Mount Sinai, in \add +a_\add*flame of_fire of_\add +a_\add*thorn_bush.
\v 31 And Mōsēs having_seen \add it\add*, marvelled at_the vision. And him approaching to_observe \add it\add*, there_became \add +the_\add*voice of_\add +the_\add*master:
\v 32 I \add =am\add* the god of_the fathers of_you, the god of_Abra'am/('Avərāhām), and of_Isa'ak/(Yiʦəḩāq), and of_Yakōb/(Ya'aqov). And Mōsēs having_become trembling, was_ not _daring to_observe.
\v 33 And the master said to_him: untie the sandal of_the feet of_you, for the place on which you_have_stood ground is holy.
\v 34 Having_seen, I_saw the mistreatment of_the people of_me in Aiguptos, and I_heard of_the groaning of_them, and I_came_down to_rescue them; and now come, I_may_send_ you _out to Aiguptos.
\v 35 This Mōsēs, whom they_disowned having_said: who you appointed ruler and judge. This \add man\add* god has_sent_out ruler and redeemer, with \add +the_\add*hand of_\add +the_\add*angel having_been_seen by_him in the thorn_bush.
\v 36 This \add man\add* led_ them _out, having_done wonders and signs in the Aiguptos, and in \add +the_\add*Red Sea, and in the desert, forty years.
\v 37 This is Mōsēs/(Mosheh) the \add man\add* having_said to_the sons of_Israēl: god will_be_raising_up \add +a_\add*prophet to_you_all, from the brothers of_you_all, like me.
\v 38 This is the \add man\add* having_become in the assembly in the desert, with the angel speaking to_him on Mount Sinai, and of_the fathers of_us, who received \add +the_\add* living _oracles to_give to_you_all;
\v 39 to_whom the fathers of_us willed not to_become obedient, but they_pushed_away \add ~him\add* and they_were_turned in the hearts of_them to Aiguptos,
\v 40 having_said to_Aarōn/('Aharon): make for_us gods who will_be_going_before before_us. For this Mōsēs, who led_out us from \add +the_\add*land of_Aiguptos, we_have_ not _known what became to_him.
\v 41 And they_made_a_calf in those days, and they_brought_up \add +a_\add*sacrifice to_the idol, and they_were_being_gladdened in the works of_the hands of_them.
\v 42 But god turned, and gave_ them _over to_be_serving unto_the army of_heaven, as it_has_been_written in scroll of_the prophets: you_all_ not _offered victims and sacrifices to_me, forty years. in the desert, house of_Israēl/(Yisərā'ēl). 
\v 43 And you_all_took_up the tabernacle of_Moloch, and the star of_ Romfa _the god of_you_all, the images which you_all_made to_be_worshipping before_them. And I_will_be_removing you_all beyond Babulōn/(Bbāvel?).
\v 44 The tabernacle of_the testimony was with_the fathers of_us in the desert, as directed the \add >one\add* speaking to_Mōsēs, to_make it according_to the pattern that he_had_seen,
\v 45 which also the fathers of_us they_brought_in, having_inherited with Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a) in the possession of_the nations, whom god drove_out from \add +the_\add*face of_the fathers of_us, until the days of_Dauid/(Ddāvid);
\v 46 who found favor before god, and requested to_find \add +a_\add*tent for_the house of_Yakōb/(Ya'aqov).
\v 47 But Solomōn/(Shəlmoh) built \add +the_\add*house for_him.
\v 48 But the Highest is_ not _dwelling in handmade \add houses\add*, as the prophet is_saying,
\v 49 heaven \add =is\add* \add +a_\add*throne to_me, and the \add +the_\add*earth \add =is\add* \add +a_\add*footstool of_the feet of_me. What house you_all_will_be_building for_me. \add +The_\add*master is_saying, or what place \add =is\add* of_the rest of_me. 
\v 50 Not the hand of_me made all these \add >things\add*. 
\v 51 Stiff-necked and uncircumcised in_hearts and the ears, you_all are_ always _opposing against_the holy spirit, as \add =are\add* the fathers of_you_all, you_all also.
\v 52 Which of_the prophets the fathers of_you_all not persecuted. And they_killed_off the \add >ones\add* having_foretold concerning the advent of_the Righteous \add One\add*, of_whom now you_all became betrayers and murderers. 
\v 53 Who received the law in \add +the_\add*ordinance of_angels, and not kept \add it\add*.
\v 54 And hearing these \add >things\add*, they_were_being_cut_through in_the hearts of_them, and they_were_gnashing their teeth at him.
\v 55 But being full of_\add +the_\add* holy _spirit, having_looked_intently into heaven, he_saw \add +the_\add*glory of_god, and Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a) having_stood by \add +the_\add*right \add hand\add* of_god,
\v 56 and said: Behold, I_am_observing the heavens having_been_opened_up, and the son of_man having_stood by \add +the_\add*right \add hand\add* of_god.
\v 57 But having_cried_out with_\add +a_\add* loud _voice, they_held the ears of_them, and they_rushed with_one_accord on him.
\v 58 And having_cast_out \add ~him\add* out the city, they_were_stoning. And the witnesses put_away the robes of_them, before the feet of_\add +a_\add*young_man being_named Saul.
\v 59 And they_were_stoning Stephen, ˱who˲_calling and saying: master Yēsous, receive the spirit of_me.
\v 60 And having_knelt on_his knees, he_cried_out with_\add +a_\add* loud _voice: master, you_may_ not _set this sin to_them. And having_said this, he_was_fallen_asleep.
\c 8
\v 1 And Saul was consenting to_the killing of_him. And \add +a_\add* great _persecution became on that day, against the assembly, which \add was\add* in Hierousalēm/(Yərūshālam). And all were_dispersed throughout the regions of_Youdaia and Samaria, except the ambassadors.
\v 2 And devout men buried Stephen, and they_made great lamentation over him.
\v 3 But Saul was_ravaging the assembly, by entering_in the houses, dragging both men and women, he_was_giving_over \add them\add* to prison.
\v 4 The \add >ones\add* therefore on_one_hand having_been_dispersed, passed_through gospel_preaching the word.
\v 5 On_the_other_hand Filippos having_come_down to \add +a_\add*city of_Samaria, was_proclaiming the messiah to_them.
\v 6 and the crowds /Were/_taking_heed to_the \add >things\add* being_spoken by Filippos with_one_accord, in the \add time\add* to_be_hearing them and to_be_seeing the signs that he_was_doing.
\v 7 For many of_the \add >ones\add* having unclean spirits, shouting with_\add +a_\add* loud _voice, they_were_coming_out, and many having_been_paralyzed and lame were_healed.
\v 8 and great joy became in that city.
\v 9 And \add +a_\add*man certain by_\add +the_\add*name Simōn, was_previously_starting in the city practicing_magic, and amazing the people of_Samaria, saying himself to_be someone great.
\v 10 To_whom all from small to great were_giving_heed saying: This is the power of_god, being_called great.
\v 11 And they_were_giving_heed to_him, because_of that to_have_amazed them with_the magic for_much time.
\v 12 But when they_believed in_Filippos, gospel_preaching concerning the kingdom the of_god and the name of_Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a) messiah, they_were_being_immersed both men and women.
\v 13 And Simōn himself also believed, and having_been_immersed, was continuing with_Filippos, observing both signs and great miracles becoming, he_was_marvelling.
\v 14 And the ambassadors in Hierousalēm having_heard that Samaria has_received the word of_god, they_sent_out Petros and Yōannēs to them,
\v 15 who having_come_down, they_prayed for them, so_that they_may_receive \add +the_\add* holy _spirit.
\v 16 For it_was not_yet having_fallen_on on no_one of_them, but they_were_ only _being having_been_immersed into the name of_the master Yēsous.
\v 17 Then they_were_laying_on their hands on them, and they_were_receiving \add +the_\add* holy _spirit.
\v 18 And Simōn having_seen that the spirit is_being_given by the laying_on of_the hands of_the ambassadors, he_offered money to_them
\v 19 saying: Give to_also_me this authority, in_order_that on_whom I_may_lay_on my hands, he_may_be_receiving \add +the_\add* holy _spirit.
\v 20 But Petros said to him: The silver of_you, it_might_be to destruction with you, because you_thought to_be_acquiring the gift of_god by money.
\v 21 ˱There˲_is no portion nor lot to_you in this matter. For the heart of_you not is right before god.
\v 22 Therefore repent of this evil of_you, and be_besought of_the master if perhaps the intention of_the heart of_you will_be_being_forgiven to_you.
\v 23 For I_am_seeing you being in \add +the_\add*gall of_bitterness and \add +the_\add*bond of_unrighteousness.
\v 24 But Simōn answering said: You_all Be_besought for me to the master, so_that nothing of_which you_all_have_spoken may_come_over on me.
\v 25 Therefore they indeed, having_testified and having_spoken the word of_the master, were_returning to Hierousalēm/(Yərūshālam), and they_were_evangelizing many villages of_the Samareitēs/(Shomərōn).
\v 26 But \add +an_\add*angel of_\add +the_\add*master spoke to Filippos saying: Rise_up and be_going to \add +the_\add*south, to the road coming_down from Hierousalēm to Gaza; this is \add +the_\add*desert \add road\add*.
\v 27 And having_risen_up, he_was_gone, and behold, \add +a_\add*man, \add +an_\add*Aithiops/(Kūshiy) eunuch, official of_Kandakē queen of_\add +the_\add*Aithiopss, who was over all the treasure of_her, had_come going_to_worship in Hierousalēm,
\v 28 and he_was returning and sitting in the chariot of_him, and was_reading the prophet Ēsaias/(Yəsha'əyāh).
\v 29 And the spirit said to_Filippos: Approach and be_joined_together to_ this _chariot.
\v 30 And Filippos having_run_up, heard of_him reading Ēsaias the prophet, and said: Then surely you_are_knowing what you_are_reading. 
\v 31 And he said: For how I_might_be_able if not someone will_be_guiding me. And he_appealed to_Filippos having_gone_up to_sit_down with him.
\v 32 And the passage of_scripture which he_was_reading was this: he_was_led as \add +a_\add*sheep to \add +the_\add*slaughter, and silent as \add +a_\add*lamb before the \add >one\add* having_shaved him, thus he_is_ not _opening_up the mouth of_him.
\v 33 In humiliation, the justice of_him was_taken_away, who will_be_describing the generation of_him. Because the life of_him is_being_taken_away from the earth.
\v 34 And the eunuch answering to_Filippos said: I_am_beseeching of_you concerning whom the prophet is_saying this. Concerning himself or concerning someone other. 
\v 35 And Filippos having_opened_up the mouth of_him, and having_begun from this scripture, he_gospel_preached Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a) to_him.
\v 36 And as they_were_going along the road, they_came to some water, and the eunuch is_saying: Behold, water, what is_forbidding me to_be_immersed. 
\v 37
\v 38 And he_commanded the chariot to_stop, and they_ both _came_down, to the water, both Filippos and the eunuch, and he_immersed him.
\v 39 But when they_went_up out_of the water, \add +the_\add*spirit of_\add +the_\add*master snatched Filippos, and the eunuch not saw him no_longer, for he_was_going the way of_him rejoicing.
\v 40 But Filippos was_found at Azotus, and passing_through he_was_gospel_preaching to_ all _the cities, until the \add time\add* him to_come to Kaisarea.
\c 9
\v 1 But Saul, still breathing of_threat and murder toward the disciples of_the master, having_approached to_the chief_priest,
\v 2 he_requested letters from him to the synagogues into Damaskos/(Ddammeseq), so_that if he_may_find any of_the way, being both men and women, having_been_bound he_may_bring \add them\add* to Hierousalēm/(Yərūshālam).
\v 3 And in the \add time\add* to_be_going, it_became him to_be_nearing to_Damaskos, and suddenly \add +a_\add*light from the sky. flashed_around. him.
\v 4 And having_fallen on the ground, he_heard \add +a_\add*voice saying to_him: Saul, Saul, why are_you_persecuting me. 
\v 5 And he_said: Who are_you, lord. and_ He _\add said\add*: I am Yēsous, whom you are_persecuting;
\v 6 but rise_up and come_in into the city, and it_will_be_being_spoken to_you what something it_is_fitting you to_be_doing.
\v 7 And the men who travelling_with with_him had_stood speechless, hearing on_one_hand of_the voice, on_the_other_hand observing no_one.
\v 8 And Saul was_raised from the ground, and the eyes of_him having_been_opened_up, he_was_seeing nothing. And leading_ him _by_hand, they_brought_in \add ~him\add* to Damaskos.
\v 9 And he_was three days not seeing, and neither he_ate nor he_drank.
\v 10 And was \add +a_\add*certain disciple in Damaskos by_\add +the_\add*name Ananias, and the master said to him in \add +a_\add*vision: Ananias. And he said: Behold, \add it_is\add* I, master.
\v 11 And the master to him: Having_risen_up, be_gone in the street being_called Straight, and seek Saul by_\add +the_\add*name Tarsian in \add +the_\add*house of_Youdas/(Yəhūdāh), for behold, he_is_praying
\v 12 and he_saw \add +a_\add*man in \add +a_\add*vision, by_\add +the_\add*name Ananias, having_come_in and having_put_on \add ^his_\add*hands on_him, so_that he_may_receive_sight.
\v 13 And Ananias answered: master, I_heard from many concerning this man, as_much_as he_did evil to_the holy \add >ones\add* of_you; in Hierousalēm;
\v 14 and here he_is_having authority from the chief_priests, to_bind all calling the name of_you.
\v 15 But the master said to him: Be_going, because this \add man\add* is \add +a_\add*vessel of_choice to_me, to_bear the name of_me both before the pagans also kings, and \add +the_\add*sons of_Israēl/(Yisərā'ēl),
\v 16 for I will_be_showing to_him as_much_as it_is_fitting him to_suffer for the name of_me.
\v 17 And Ananias went_away and came_in into the house, and having_laid_on on him his hands he_said: Saul, brother, the master has_sent_out me Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a), the \add >one\add* having_been_seen by_you on the road in_which you_were_coming, so_that you_may_receive_sight and may_be_filled with_\add +the_\add* holy _spirit.
\v 18 And immediately fell_away \add something\add* of_him from the eyes like scales, and, he_received_sight, and having_risen_up he_was_immersed,
\v 19 and having_taken food, was_strengthened. And he_became some days with the disciples in Damaskos/(Ddammeseq).
\v 20 And immediately in the synagogues, he_was_proclaiming Yēsous that this \add >one\add* is the son of_god.
\v 21 And all were_marvelling hearing, and they_were_saying: Is not this the \add >one\add* having_persecuted the \add >ones\add* calling this name in, Hierousalēm/(Yərūshālam), and here for this he_had_come, in_order_that having_been_bound, he_may_bring them to the chief_priests. 
\v 22 But Saul was_being_ more _strengthened, and was_confounding Jews dwelling in Damaskos, teaching that this \add >one\add* is the messiah.
\v 23 And when many days were_being_fulfilled, the Jews plotted_together to_kill him;
\v 24 but the plot of_them was_known to_Saul. and They_were_watching_closely also the gates both day and night, so_that they_may_kill him;
\v 25 and the disciples of_him having_taken \add ~him\add* by_night through the wall, they_let_ him _down, having_lowered \add ~him\add* in \add +a_\add*basket.
\v 26 And having_arrived in Hierousalēm, he_was_attempting to_be_being_joined_together to_the disciples. But all were_fearing him, not believing that he_is \add +a_\add*disciple.
\v 27 But Barnabas having_taken_hold_of him, brought \add ~him\add* to the ambassadors, and described to_them how he_saw the master on the road, and that he_spoke to_him, and how he_spoke_boldly in Damaskos in the name of_Yēsous.
\v 28 And he_was with them, entering_in and going_out into Hierousalēm, speaking_boldly in the name of_the master.
\v 29 He_was_ both _speaking and was_debating with the Hellenists; but they were_attempting to_kill him.
\v 30 But having_known \add it\add*, the brothers brought_ him _down to Kaisarea, and they_sent_ him _away to Tarsus.
\v 31 The indeed Therefore assembly throughout all of_Youdaia, and Galilaia/(Ggālīl), and Samaria, was_having peace, being_built and going in_the fear of_the master, and it_was_being_multiplied in_the exhortation of_the holy spirit.
\v 32 And it_became Petros passing_through through all \add regions\add*, to_come_down also to the holy \add >ones\add* dwelling_in Lydda.
\v 33 And he_found there \add +a_\add* certain _man by_\add +the_\add*name Eneas, lying_down for eight years on \add +a_\add*pallet, who was having_been_paralyzed.
\v 34 And Petros said to_him: Eneas, Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a) messiah is_healing you; rise_up, and make_the_bed for_yourself. And immediately he_rose_up.
\v 35 And all the \add >ones\add* dwelling_in Lydda and Saron, saw him, who turned_back to the master.
\v 36 And in Yoppē was \add +a_\add*certain disciple by_\add +the_\add*name Tabitha, which being_interpreted is_being_called: \add +the_\add*Gazelle|Dorcas. She was full of_ good _works, and of_alms that she_was_doing.
\v 37 And it_became in those days, she having_ailed to_die_off. And having_washed her they_put in \add +an_\add*upper_room.
\v 38 And Lydda being near to_Yoppē, the disciples having_heard that Petros is in it, they_sent_out two men to him imploring: You_may_ not _delay to_pass_through to us.
\v 39 And Petros having_risen_up, came_together with_them, who having_arrived, they_brought_up into the upper_room, and all the widows stood_by by_him, weeping and showing \add +the_\add*tunics and clothes, as_much_as Dorcas was_making being with them.
\v 40 But Petros having_cast_out all outside, and having_knelt his knees he_prayed, and having_turned_back to the body said: Tabitha, rise_up. And she opened_up the eyes of_her, and having_seen Petros, she_sat_up.
\v 41 And having_given \add ^his_\add*hand to_her, he_raised_ her _up, and having_called the holy \add >ones\add* and the widows, he_presented her living.
\v 42 And it_became known throughout all of_Yoppē, and many believed on the master.
\v 43 And it_became many days to_remain in Yoppē, with \add +a_\add*certain Simōn, \add +a_\add*tanner.
\c 10
\v 1 And \add +a_\add* certain _man in Kaisarea by_\add +the_\add*name Cornelius, \add +a_\add*centurion of of_\add +the_\add*Cohort being_called Italian,
\v 2 devout and revering god with all the household of_him, doing many alms to_the people, and beseeching of_god through everything.
\v 3 About \add +the_\add*ninth hour of_the day he_saw in \add +a_\add*vision clearly, as_if, \add +an_\add*angel of_god having_come_in to him, and having_said to_him: Cornelius. 
\v 4 And he, having_looked_intently at_him and having_become frightened, said: What is_it, lord. And he_said to_him: The prayers of_you, and the alms of_you, went_up for \add +a_\add*memorial before god.
\v 5 And now send men to Yoppē, and send_for \add +a_\add*certain Simōn, who is_being_called Petros.
\v 6 This \add >one\add* is_being_lodged with \add +a_\add*certain Simōn \add +a_\add*tanner, whose house is by \add +the_\add*sea.
\v 7 And when the angel speaking to_him, went_away, having_called two of_the house_servants and \add +a_\add* devout _soldier of_the \add >ones\add* continuing with_him,
\v 8 and having_explained all \add >things\add* to_them, he_sent_ them _out to Yoppē.
\v 9 And on_the \add day\add* of_next, those journeying and nearing to_the city, Petros went_up on the housetop to_pray, about \add +the_\add*hour sixth.
\v 10 But he_became hungry and was_wanting to_taste, but them preparing, \add +a_\add*trance became on him,
\v 11 and he_is_observing heaven having_been_opened_up, and \add +an_\add* certain _object coming_down, as \add +a_\add* by_four _linen_sheet, great corners being_let_down on the earth,
\v 12 in which was_being all the quadrupeds, and reptiles of_the earth, and birds of_the sky.
\v 13 And \add +a_\add*voice became to him: Having_risen_up, Petros, sacrifice and eat. 
\v 14 But Petros said: By_no_means, master, because I_ never _ate any common and unclean \add >thing\add*.
\v 15 And \add +a_\add*voice \add said\add* again for \add +the_\add*second \add time\add* to him: What god cleansed, you be_ not _defiling.
\v 16 And this became for thrice, and immediately the object was_taken_up into heaven.
\v 17 And while Petros by himself was_thoroughly_perplexing, what might_be the vision that he_saw, behold, the men having_been_sent_out from Cornelius, having_inquired for_the house of_Simōn, stood_by at the gate.
\v 18 And having_called, they_were_inquiring if Simōn, who \add =is\add* being_called Petros, is_being_lodged here.
\v 19 And Petros pondering about the vision, the spirit said, to_him: Behold, three men are_seeking you.
\v 20 But having_risen_up, come_down and be_going with them, doubting nothing, because I have_sent_ them _out.
\v 21 And Petros having_come_down, to the men said: Behold, I am whom you_all_are_seeking; what \add =is\add* the cause for which you_all_are_coming. 
\v 22 And they said: Cornelius \add +a_\add*centurion, righteous man and revering god, and being_attested by all the nation of_the Jews, was_called by \add +an_\add* holy _angel, to_send_for you to the house of_him, and to_hear words from you.
\v 23 Therefore having_called_ them _in. he_lodged. And on_the \add day\add* of_next having_risen_up, he_came_out with them, and some of_the brothers from Yoppē came_together with_him.
\v 24 And on_the \add day\add* of_next, he_came_in into Kaisarea. And Cornelius was expecting them, having_called_together the relatives of_him and close friends.
\v 25 And as it_became Petros, to_come_in Cornelius having_met with_him , having_fallen at his feet, he_worshipped \add ~him\add*.
\v 26 But Petros raised him saying: Rise_up; I also myself am \add +a_\add*human.
\v 27 And conversing with_him, he_came_in and he_is_finding many having_come_together.
\v 28 And he_was_saying to them: You_all are_knowing how unlawful it_is for_\add +a_\add* Jewish _man to_be_being_joined_together or to_be_approaching to_\add +an_\add*other_tribe. god to_and_ showed _me, to_be_calling not_one \add +a_\add*person common or unclean.
\v 29 Therefore also having_been_sent_for I_came unquestionably. Therefore I_am_inquiring for_what statement you_all_sent_for me. 
\v 30 And Cornelius was_saying: From fourth day until this hour, I_was praying in the house of_me the ninth \add hour\add*, and behold, \add +a_\add*man stood before me in shining clothing,
\v 31 and he_is_saying: Cornelius, the prayer of_you was_listened_to and the alms of_you were_reminded before god.
\v 32 Therefore send to Yoppē and summon Simōn, who is_being_called Petros; this \add >one\add* is_being_lodged in \add +the_\add*house of_Simōn, \add +a_\add*tanner by \add +the_\add*sea.
\v 33 Therefore I_ immediately _sent to you, and you did well therefore. having_arrived now we all are_being_present before god, to_hear all the \add >things\add* having_been_commanded to_you by the master.
\v 34 And Petros having_opened_up mouth said: In truth I_am_grasping that god is not \add +a_\add*favorer,
\v 35 but in every nation, the \add >one\add* revering him and working righteousness, is acceptable to_him.
\v 36 The word he_sent_out to_the sons of_Israēl/(Yisərā'ēl), gospel_preaching peace through Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a) messiah; this \add >one\add* is master of_all.
\v 37 You_all have_known the word having_become throughout all Youdaia, having_begun from Galilaia/(Ggālīl), after the immersion that Yōannēs proclaimed,
\v 38 Yēsous from Nazaret, how god anointed him with_\add +the_\add* holy _spirit and power, who passed_through doing_good and healing all the \add >ones\add* being_oppressed by the devil, because god was with him.
\v 39 And we \add =are\add* witnesses of_all \add >things\add* that he_did both in the region of_the Jews and in in_Hierousalēm/(Yərūshālam); whom also they_killed, having_hanged \add ~him\add* on \add +a_\add*cross.
\v 40 This \add >one\add* god raised on_the third day, and gave him to_become manifest,
\v 41 not to_all the people, but to_\add +the_\add*witnesses having_been_previously_appointed by god, to_us, who ate_with and drank_with with_him after the \add time\add* him to_rise_up from \add +the_\add*dead.
\v 42 And he_commanded to_us to_proclaim to_the people, and to_testify that this \add >one\add* is the \add >one\add* having_been_designated by god, as_judge of_\add +the_\add*living and \add +the_\add*dead.
\v 43 To_this \add >one\add* all the prophets are_testifying, everyone believing in him to_receive forgiveness of_sins through the name of_him.
\v 44 Petros still speaking these words, the holy spirit fell_on on all the \add >ones\add* hearing the word.
\v 45 And the believers from \add +the_\add*circumcision, as_many_as came_together with_Petros marvelled, that the gift of_the holy spirit has_been_poured_out even on the pagans.
\v 46 For they_were_hearing of_them speaking with_tongues, and magnifying god. Then Petros answered,
\v 47 Surely_not anyone is_able to_forbid the water these to_ not _be_immersed, who received the holy spirit, as we_ also _\add did\add*. 
\v 48 and He_commanded them in the name of_Yēsous messiah to_be_immersed. Then they_asked him to_remain_on some days.
\c 11
\v 1 And the ambassadors and the brothers being in Youdaia heard that the pagans also received the word of_god.
\v 2 and when Petros went_up to Hierousalēm, the \add >ones\add* of \add +the_\add*circumcision were_doubting with him,
\v 3 saying, that He_came_in to men, having uncircumcision, and ate_with with_them.
\v 4 But Petros having_begun, was_explaining to_them consecutively, saying,
\v 5 I was in \add +the_\add*city of_Yoppē praying, and in \add +a_\add*trance I_saw \add +a_\add*vision, \add +an_\add* certain _object coming_down like \add +a_\add* by_/its/_four _linen_sheet, great corners being_let_down out_of heaven, and it_came until me;
\v 6 on which having_looked_intently I_was_observing, and I_saw the quadrupeds of_the earth, and the wild_beasts, and the reptiles, and the birds of_the sky.
\v 7 And I_ also _heard from_\add +a_\add*voice saying to_me: Petros having_risen_up, sacrifice and eat.
\v 8 But I_said By_no_means, master, because common or unclean never came_in into the mouth of_me.
\v 9 But \add +the_\add*voice answered for \add +a_\add*second \add time\add* out_of heaven: What god cleansed, you be_ not _defiling.
\v 10 And this became for thrice, and all was_pulled_up again into heaven.
\v 11 And behold, immediately three men stood_by at the house in which we_were, having_been_sent_out from Kaisarea to me.
\v 12 And the spirit told to_me, to_come_together with_them, having_doubted nothing. And these six brothers also came with me, and we_came_in into the house of_the man.
\v 13 He_reported and to_us how he_saw the angel in the house of_him, having_been_stood and having_said: Send_out to Yoppē, and send_for Simōn, the \add >one\add* being_called Petros,
\v 14 who will_be_speaking words to you, in which you will_be_being_saved and all the household of_you.
\v 15 And at the \add time\add* me to_begin to_be_speaking, the holy spirit fell_on on them, as also on us in \add +the_\add*beginning.
\v 16 And I_was_reminded of_the word of_the master, how he_was_saying: Yōannēs on_one_hand immersed with_water, on_the_other_hand you_all will_be_being_immersed with \add +the_\add* holy _spirit.
\v 17 Therefore if god gave the same gift to_them, as also to_us having_believed on the master Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a) messiah, who was I powerful to_forbid god. 
\v 18 And having_heard these \add >things\add*, they_kept_quiet and glorified god saying: Consequently god also gave repentance to life to_the pagans.
\v 19 The \add >ones\add* therefore indeed having_been_dispersed by the tribulation having_become concerning Stephen, passed_through to Phoenicia, and Cyprus, and Antioⱪeia, speaking the word to_no_one except only to_Jews.
\v 20 But were some of them men, Cyprians and Cyrenians, who having_come into Antioⱪeia, were_speaking also to the Greeks, gospel_preaching the master Yēsous.
\v 21 And \add +the_\add*hand of_\add +the_\add*master was with them, and \add +a_\add*great number having_believed, turned_back to the master.
\v 22 And the word concerning them was_heard in the ears of_the assembly being in Hierousalēm/(Yərūshālam), and they_sent_away Barnabas as_far_as Antioⱪeia;
\v 23 who having_arrived, and having_seen the grace of_god, was_elated and was_exhorting all to_be_remaining with_the master with_purpose of_heart,
\v 24 because he_was \add +a_\add* good _man, and full of_\add +the_\add* holy _spirit and of_faith. And \add +a_\add* large _crowd was_added to_the master.
\v 25 And he_came_out to Tarsus to_seek_out Saul,
\v 26 and having_found \add ~him\add*, he_brought \add ~him\add* to Antioⱪeia. And it_became to_them also to_be_gathered_together in the assembly \add +a_\add* whole _year, and to_teach \add +a_\add* large _crowd, and to_call first the disciples, followers_of_the_messiah. in. Antioⱪeia.
\v 27 And in these days, prophets came_down from Hierousalēm to Antioⱪeia.
\v 28 And one from them by_\add +the_\add*name Agabus having_stood_up, signified by the spirit, \add +a_\add* great _famine to_be_going going_to_be over all the inhabited_world; which became during Claudius.
\v 29 And as anyone of_the disciples was_prospering, each of_them designated to_send for service to_the brothers dwelling in Youdaia;
\v 30 which they_ also _did, having_sent_out \add it\add* to the elders by \add +the_\add*hand of_Barnabas and Saul.
\c 12
\v 1 And concerning that time, Hērōdēs the king laid_on \add ^his_\add*hands to_mistreat some of_the \add >ones\add* from the assembly.
\v 2 And he_killed Yakōbos/(Ya'aqov), the brother of_Yōannēs, with_\add +a_\add*sword.
\v 3 And having_seen that is pleasing it_the Jews, he_proceeded to_ also _capture Petros (and ˱those˲_were \add +the_\add*days of_non-fermented \add bread\add*),
\v 4 whom also having_arrested, he_put in prison, having_given_over \add ~him\add* to_four squads_of_four of_soldiers to_be_guarding him, wishing after the passover to_bring_ him _up to_the people.
\v 5 therefore on_one_hand Petros was_being_kept in the prison; on_the_other_hand prayer was earnestly becoming by the assembly to god concerning him.
\v 6 And when Hērōdēs was_going to_bring_ him _forth on_ that _night, Petros was being_fallen_asleep between two soldiers, having_been_bound with_ two _chains, and guards before the door were_guarding the prison.
\v 7 And behold, \add +an_\add*angel of_\add +the_\add*master stood_by, and \add +a_\add*light shined in the prison_cell. And having_struck the side of_Petros, he_raised him saying: Rise_up in quickness. And the chains from his hands fell_from. of_him.
\v 8 And the angel said to him: Gird \add yourself\add* and tie_on the sandals of_you. And he_did thus. And he_is_saying to_him: Clothe the coat of_you, and be_following after_me.
\v 9 And having_come_out he_was_following, and he_had_ not _known that what becoming by the angel is true, but he_was_supposing to_be_seeing \add +a_\add*vision.
\v 10 And having_passed_through \add +the_\add*first guard and \add +the_\add*second, they_came to the iron gate, leading into the city, which automatic was_opened_up to_them, and having_come_out they_went_ahead on_ one _street, and immediately the angel withdrew from him.
\v 11 And Petros having_become to himself said: Now I_have_ truly _known that master sent_away the angel of_him, and rescued me out_of \add +the_\add*hand of_Hērōdēs and all the expectation of_the people of_the Jews.
\v 12 And having_become_aware_of \add it\add*, he_came to the house of_Maria/(Mirəyām), the mother of_Yōannēs, who \add =is\add* being_called Markos, where many were having_been_convened_together and praying.
\v 13 And of_him having_knocked the door of_the gate, \add +a_\add*servant_girl by_\add +the_\add*name Rhoda went_ahead to_answer.
\v 14 And having_recognized the voice of_Petros, from joy she_ not _opened_up the gate, but having_run_in she_reported Petros to_have_stood before the gate.
\v 15 And they to her said: You_are_raving_mad. But she was_insisting to_be_having thus. And they were_saying: It_is the angel of_him.
\v 16 But Petros was_continuing_on knocking, and having_opened_up \add it\add* they_saw him, and they_marvelled.
\v 17 But having_gestured to_them with_his hand to_be_keeping_silent, he_described how the master led_ him _out from the prison. And he_said: Report these \add >things\add* to_Yakōbos/(Ya'aqov) and to_the brothers. And having_come_out, he_was_gone to another place.
\v 18 And having_become day, there_was no little disturbance among the soldiers, what consequently became Petros.
\v 19 And Hērōdēs having_sought_after him and not having_found \add ~him\add*, having_examined the guards, commanded \add them\add* to_be_led_away \add to_death\add*. And having_come_down from Youdaia to Kaisarea, he_was_staying.
\v 20 And he_was raging with_\add +the_\add*Tyrians and Sidōn/(Tsīdōn); and with_one_accord they_were_coming to him, and having_persuaded Blastus, who \add was\add* over the bedchamber of_the king, they_were_requesting peace, because_of that the region of_them to_be_being_nourished by the royal.
\v 21 And on_\add +the_\add*appointed day, Hērōdēs, having_dressed_in \add +the_\add*royal clothing, having_sat_down on the tribunal, was_publicly_addressing to them.
\v 22 And the public was_crying_out: \add +The_\add*voice of_\add +a_\add*god, and not of_\add +a_\add*human. 
\v 23 And immediately \add +an_\add*angel of_\add +the_\add*master struck him, for that he_ not _gave the glory to_god, and having_become worm-infested, he_stopped_breathing.
\v 24 But the word of_the of_god was_growing and was_being_multiplied.
\v 25 And Barnabas and Saul returned to Hierousalēm/(Yərūshālam), having_fulfilled the service, having_taken_along_with \add them\add* Yōannēs, having_been_called Markos.
\c 13
\v 1 And there_were prophets and teachers in Antioⱪeia, in the assembly being: jointly Barnabas, and Sumeōn/(Shimə'ōn) who being_called Niger, and Lucius the Cyrenian, And Manaen raised_with of_Hērōdēs of_the tetrarch, and Saul.
\v 2 And of_them ministering to_the master and fasting, the holy spirit said: Indeed set_apart to_me Barnabas and Saul, for the work which I_have_called_ them _to.
\v 3 Then having_fasted, and having_prayed, and having_laid_on their hands on_them, they_sent_away \add them\add*.
\v 4 Therefore indeed They having_been_sent_out by holy spirit, came_down to Seleucia, and from_there they_sailed_away to Cyprus.
\v 5 And having_become in Salamis, they_were_proclaiming the word of_the of_god in the synagogues of_the Jews. And they_were_ also _having Yōannēs, \add +an_\add*attendant.
\v 6 And having_passed_through all the island until Paphos, they_found \add +a_\add*man, \add +a_\add*certain Jewish false_prophet magician, to_whose name \add was\add* Barjesus,
\v 7 who was with the proconsul Sergius Paulos, \add +a_\add* intelligent _man. He, having_called_to Barnabas and Saul, sought_after to_hear the word of_god.
\v 8 But Elymas the magician (for thus is_being_translated the name of_him was_resisting against_them) seeking to_pervert the proconsul from the faith.
\v 9 But Saul, the \add >one\add* also \add called\add* Paulos, having_been_filled with_\add +the_\add* holy _spirit, having_looked_intently at him
\v 10 said: Oh son of_\add +the_\add*devil full of_all deceit and all fraud, enemy of_all righteousness, not will_you_be_ceasing perverting the straight ways of_the master. 
\v 11 And now behold, \add +the_\add*hand of_\add +the_\add*master on you, and you_will_be blind, not seeing the sun until \add +a_\add*season. and immediately \add +a_\add*mist and darkness fell on him, and going_around he_was_seeking one_leading_by_hand.
\v 12 Then the proconsul having_seen what having_become, he_believed being_astonished at the teaching of_the master.
\v 13 And the \add >ones\add* around \add ~him\add* Paulos having_been_launched from Paphos, came to Perga of_Pamphylia. But Yōannēs having_went_away from them, he_returned to Hierousalēm.
\v 14 But they, having_passed_through from Perga, arrived to Antioⱪeia Pisidia, and having_come into the synagogue on_the day of_the sabbaths, they_sat_down.
\v 15 And after the public_reading of_the law and of_the prophets, the synagogue_leaders sent_out to them saying: Men, brothers, if among you_all there_is any word of_exhortation toward the people, be_speaking \add it\add*.
\v 16 And Paulos having_stood_up, and having_gestured with_his hand said: Men, Israēl/(Yisərā'ēl)ites, and you_all revering god, hear \add me\add*.
\v 17 The god of_the people of_this Israēl chose the fathers of_us, and exalted the people in the sojourn in \add +the_\add*land of_Aiguptos/(Miʦərayim), and with \add ^his_\add*arm high, he_led_out them out_of it,
\v 18 and \add +the_\add*time he_sustained them in the desert about, forty_year,
\v 19 and having_taken_down seven nations in \add +the_\add*land of_Canaan, he_passed_down the land of_them–
\v 20 about four_hundred years and fifty. And after these \add >things\add*, he_gave \add them\add* judges until Samuel \add +the_\add*prophet.
\v 21 And_from_there they_requested \add +a_\add*king, and god gave to_them Saul, son of_Kis, \add +a_\add*man of \add +the_\add*tribe of_Benjamin, for_ forty _years.
\v 22 And having_removed him, he_raised Dauid/(Ddāvid) to_them for \add +a_\add*king, to_whom also he_spoke having_testified: I_found Dauid the \add son\add* of_Iessai/(Yishay): \add +a_\add*man according_to the heart of_me, who will_be_doing all the wills of_me.
\v 23 Of the seed of_this \add >one\add* god according_to promise, brought to_Israēl \add +a_\add*saviour, Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a),
\v 24 of_Yōannēs having_publicly_proclaimed before \add +the_\add*face of_the entrance of_him, \add +a_\add*immersion of_repentance to_all the people of_Israēl.
\v 25 And while Yōannēs was_fulfilling the course, he_was_saying: What you_all_are_suspecting me to_be. I am_ not _\add he\add*, but behold, he_is_coming after me, of_whom I_am not worthy to_untie the sandal of_his feet.
\v 26 Men, brothers, sons of_\add +the_\add*descent of_Abra'am/('Avərāhām), and you_all among you_all revering god, to_us the word of_ this _salvation was_sent_away.
\v 27 For the \add >ones\add* dwelling in Hierousalēm/(Yərūshālam) and the rulers of_them, having_not_known this \add >one\add* and the voices of_the prophets, who being_read on every sabbath, having_judged \add ~him\add* they_fulfilled \add them\add*.
\v 28 And having_found not_one cause for_death, they_requested Pilatos him to_be_killed.
\v 29 And when they_finished all the \add >things\add* having_been_written concerning him, having_taken_down \add ~him\add* from the cross, they_put \add ~him\add* in \add +a_\add*tomb.
\v 30 But god raised him from \add +the_\add*dead;
\v 31 who was_seen for more days, to_the \add >ones\add* having_come_up_with him from Galilaia/(Ggālīl) to Hierousalēm, who are now witnesses of_him to the people.
\v 32 And we are_gospel_preaching to_you_all the the promise having_become to fathers,
\v 33 that god has_fulfilled this to_the children of_us, having_raised_up Yēsous, as also in the second psalm it_has_been_written: you are son of_me, today I have_bore you.
\v 34 And that raised_ him _up from \add +the_\add*dead, no_longer going to_be_returning to decay, thus he_has_said, I_will_be_giving to_you_all the devout faithful of_Dauid.
\v 35 Therefore also in another \add psalm\add* he_is_saying: you will_ not _be_giving the Devout \add One\add* of_you to_see decay.
\v 36 For on_one_hand Dauid having_attended to_the counsel of_god to_\add ^his_\add*own generation, was_fallen_asleep and was_added to the fathers of_him, and saw decay.
\v 37 On_the_other_hand which \add >one\add* god raised not saw decay.
\v 38 Therefore it_let_be known, to_you_all, men, brothers, that through this \add >one\add*, forgiveness of_sins is_being_proclaimed to_you_all, from all \add >things\add* of_which you_all_were_ not _able to_be_justified in \add +the_\add*law of_Mōsēs/(Mosheh),
\v 39 everyone believing in this \add >one\add* is_being_justified.
\v 40 Therefore be_watching_out, lest the \add word\add* having_been_said in the prophets may_come_over:
\v 41 watch, you scoffers, and wonder and be_perishing, because I am_doing \add +a_\add*work in the days of_you_all, \add +a_\add*work which by_no_means you_all_may_ not _believe, if someone may_be_describing_in_detail \add it\add* to_you_all.
\v 42 And of_them departing, they_were_imploring these words to_be_spoken to_them on the afterward sabbath.
\v 43 And having_been_released of_the synagogue, many of_the Jews and of_the worshipping converts followed after_Paulos and Barnabas, who addressing to_them, were_persuading them to_be_remaining in_the grace of_god.
\v 44 And on_the coming sabbath, almost all the city was_gathered_together to_hear the word of_god.
\v 45 But the Jews having_seen the crowds, they_were_filled with_jealousy and they_were_speaking_against against_the_ slandering _\add >things\add* being_spoken by Paulos.
\v 46 and, Paulos and Barnabas Having_spoken_boldly said, it_was necessary the word of_god first to_be_spoken To_you_all. Since and you_all_are_pushing_ it _away, and not worthy you_all_are_judging yourselves of_eternal life, behold, we_are_being_turned to the pagans.
\v 47 For thus the master has_commanded to_us: I_have_set you for \add +a_\add*light of_\add +the_\add*pagans, you to_be for salvation to \add +the_\add*last of_the earth.
\v 48 And hearing \add it\add* the pagans, they_were_rejoicing and were_glorifying the word of_the master, and as_many_as were having_been_appointed to eternal life believed.
\v 49 And the word of_the master was_being_carried_through through all the region.
\v 50 But the Jews incited the prominent worshipping women, and the leaders of_the city, and they_stirred_up \add +a_\add*persecution against Paulos and Barnabas, and they_cast_ them _out from the regions of_them.
\v 51 But they, having_shaken_off the dust of_the feet against them, came to Ikonion.
\v 52 And the disciples were_being_filled with_joy and \add +the_\add* holy _spirit.
\c 14
\v 1 And it_became, in Ikonion with the same them to_come_in into the synagogue of_the Jews, and to_speak thus so_that \add +a_\add*great multitude of_ both _Jews and Greeks to_believe.
\v 2 But the Jews having_disbelieved stirred_up and mistreated the hearts of_the pagans against the brothers.
\v 3 Therefore on_one_hand they_stayed much time, speaking_boldly for the master, the \add >one\add* testifying the word of_the grace of_him, to_giving signs and wonders to_be_becoming through the hands of_them.
\v 4 On_the_other_hand the multitude of_the city was_divided, and on_one_hand they were with the Jews, on_the_other_hand they with the ambassadors.
\v 5 And when \add +an_\add*impulse both of_the pagans and Jews with the rulers of_them became, to_mistreat and to_throw_stones at_them,
\v 6 having_become_aware_of, they_fled_down to the cities of_Lycaonia, Lustra, and Derbe, and the surrounding_region,
\v 7 and_there they_were gospel_preaching.
\v 8 And \add +a_\add*certain man, in Lustra powerless by_the feet, who never walked was_sitting lame from \add +the_\add*womb of_\add +the_\add*mother of_him.
\v 9 This \add man\add* was_hearing of_Paulos speaking, who having_looked_intently at_him and having_seen that he_is_having faith to_be_healed,
\v 10 said with_\add +a_\add*loud voice: Stand_up straight on the feet of_you. And he_sprang_up and was_walking.
\v 11 And the crowds having_seen what Paulos did, lifted_up the voice of_them In_Lycaonian saying: The gods having_been_likened to_men, came_down to us.
\v 12 They_were_calling both Barnabas: Zeus, and Paulos: Hermas, since he was the \add >one\add* leading of_the matter.
\v 13 And the \add +the_\add*priest of_Zeus, being before the city, having_brought bulls and garlands to the gates, he_was_wanting to_be_sacrificing with the crowds.
\v 14 But the ambassadors Barnabas and Paulos having_heard, having_torn the robes of_themselves, they_rushed_out into the crowd, crying_out
\v 15 and saying: Men, why are_you_all_doing these \add >things\add*. We also are humans like_natured with_you_all, evangelizing you_all to_be_turning_back from these useless \add >things\add* to living god: who made the heaven, and the earth, and the sea, and all the \add >things\add* in them.
\v 16 Who in the generations having_gone_by, allowed all the nations to_be_going to_the ways of_them.
\v 17 And_yet left himself not without_witness, working_good from_heaven to_you_all giving rains and fruitful seasons, filling with_food and the hearts of_you_all gladness.
\v 18 And saying these \add >things\add*, with_difficulty they_restrained the crowds not to_be_sacrificing to_them.
\v 19 But Jews Came_over from Antioⱪeia and Ikonion, and having_persuaded the crowds, and having_stoned Paulos, they_were_dragging \add ~him\add* outside the city, thinking him to_have_died.
\v 20 But of_the disciples having_surrounded him, having_stood_up he_came_in into the city. And on_the \add day\add* of_next he_came_out with Barnabas to Derbe.
\v 21 And having_gospel_preached that city, and having_discipled many, they_returned to Lustra, and to Ikonion, and to Antioⱪeia,
\v 22 strengthening the souls of_the disciples, exhorting \add them\add* to_be_remaining_in in_the faith, and that it_is_fitting us to_come_in into the kingdom of_god through many tribulations.
\v 23 And having_chosen elders for_them in assembly, having_prayed with fastings, they_entrusted them to_the master on whom they_had_believed.
\v 24 And having_passed_through Pisidia, they_came to Pamphylia,
\v 25 and having_spoken the word of_the master in Perga, they_came_down to Attalia,
\v 26 and_from_there they_sailed_away to Antioⱪeia, whence they_were having_been_given_over to_the grace of_god, for the work that they_fulfilled.
\v 27 And having_arrived and having_gathered_together the assembly, they_were_declaring as_much_as god did with them, and that he_opened_up \add +a_\add*door of_faith to_the pagans.
\v 28 And they_were_staying no little time with the disciples.
\c 15
\v 1 And some having_come_down from Youdaia, were_teaching the brothers, If you_all _may_ not _be_circumcised to_the custom of_Mōsēs/(Mosheh), you_all_are_ not _being_able to_be_saved.
\v 2 And dissension and no little debate having_become by_Paulos and Barnabas with them, they_determined Paulos and Barnabas and some others from them to_be_going_up, to the ambassadors and elders in Hierousalēm/(Yərūshālam) about this question.
\v 3 therefore indeed The having_been_sent_forward by the assembly, they_were_passing_through both Phoenicia and Samaria, describing_in_detail the conversion of_the pagans, and they_were_producing great joy to_all the brothers.
\v 4 And having_arrived in Hierousalēm, they_were_accepted by the assembly, and the ambassadors, and the elders, and they_declared as_much_as god did with them.
\v 5 But some of_the \add >ones\add* of the sect of_the Farisaios_sect having_believed rose_up, saying, It_is_fitting to_be_circumcising them, and to_be_commanding \add them\add* to_be_keeping the law of_Mōsēs.
\v 6 And the ambassadors and the elders were_gathered_together, to_see about this matter.
\v 7 And having_become much debate, Petros having_stood_up said to them: Men, brothers, you_all are_knowing that from ancient days among you_all, god chose for_the pagans to_hear by the mouth of_me, the word of_the gospel and to_believe.
\v 8 And god the heart_knower testified to_them, having_given \add them\add* the holy spirit as also to_us,
\v 9 and he_distinguished nothing between both us and them, having_purified the hearts of_them by_the faith.
\v 10 Therefore now why are_you_all_testing god, to_put_on \add +a_\add*yoke on the neck of_the disciples, that neither the fathers of_us nor we were_able to_bear. 
\v 11 But by the grace of_the \add +the_\add*master Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a), we_are_believing to_be_saved also_those in which manner.
\v 12 And all the multitude kept_silent, and they_were_hearing from_Barnabas and Paulos, explaining as_much_as god did, signs and wonders among the pagans by them.
\v 13 And after them to_keep_silent, Yakōbos/(Ya'aqov) answered saying: Men, brothers, hear from_me.
\v 14 Sumeōn/(Shimə'ōn) explained as first god visited, to_take out_of \add +the_\add*pagans \add +a_\add*people for_the name of_him.
\v 15 And with_this are_agreeing_together the words of_the prophets as it_has_been_written,
\v 16 After these \add >things\add* I_will_be_returning and I_will_be_rebuilding_up the tabernacle of_Dauid/(Ddāvid) which having_fallen, and of_it having_been_overturned, I_will_be_rebuilding_up and I_will_be_restoring it,
\v 17 so_that the remnant of_the people may_seek_out the master, also all the pagans, on whom has_been_called the name of_me on them, is_saying \add +the_\add*master doing these \add >things\add*,
\v 18 known from eternity.
\v 19 Therefore I am_judging to_ not _be_troubling to_the \add >ones\add* from the pagans, turning_back to god,
\v 20 but to_write to_them to_be_keeping_away from_the pollutions of_idols, and sexual_immorality, and the strangled \add animal\add*, and blood.
\v 21 For Mōsēs/(Mosheh) from ancient generations in_every city the \add >ones\add* proclaiming him, is_having being_read in the synagogues on every sabbath.
\v 22 Then it_supposed to_the ambassadors and the elders with all the assembly, having_chosen men from them, to_send \add them\add* to Antioⱪeia with Paulos and Barnabas– Youdas/(Yəhūdāh) being_called Barsabbas and Silas, leading men among the brothers,
\v 23 having_written by \add +the_\add*hand of_them: the ambassadors and the elders, brothers, to_be_greeting to_the \add >ones\add* in Antioⱪeia, and Suria/('Arām), and Cilicia, brothers from \add +the_\add*pagans.
\v 24 Since we_heard that some from us to_whom we_ not _instructed having_come_out, disturbed you_all by_ upsetting _words the hearts of_you_all,
\v 25 it_supposed to_us having_become with_one_accord, having_chosen men to_send to you_all, with Barnabas and Paulos the beloved of_us,
\v 26 men having_given_over the lives of_them for the name of_the master of_us, Yēsous messiah.
\v 27 Therefore we_have_sent_out Youdas and Silas, and them reporting the same \add >things\add* by word.
\v 28 For it_supposed to_the holy spirit and to_us, nothing more burden to_be_being_laid_on on_you_all, except necessarily these \add >things\add*:
\v 29 to_be_keeping_away from_idol_sacrificed \add >things\add*, and from_blood, and from_strangled \add animals\add*, and from_sexual_immorality; from which keeping yourselves, you_all_will_be_doing well. Farewell. 
\v 30 Therefore indeed they having_been_sent_away, came_down to Antioⱪeia, and having_gathered_together the multitude, they_handed_out the letter.
\v 31 And having_read \add it\add*, they_were_elated at the exhortation.
\v 32 Both Youdas and Silas, also themselves being prophets, by much speech, exhorted the brothers and they_strengthened \add them\add*.
\v 33 And having_made \add some\add* time \add there\add*, they_were_sent_away with peace from the brothers, to the \add >ones\add* having_sent_ them _out.
\v 34
\v 35 But Paulos and Barnabas were_staying in Antioⱪeia, teaching and gospel_preaching the word of_the master with many others also.
\v 36 And after some days, Paulos said to Barnabas, indeed having_turned_back we_may_visit the brothers in every city, in which we_proclaimed the word of_the master, how they_are_having.
\v 37 And Barnabas was_wishing to_take_along_with \add them\add* also Yōannēs, being_called Markos.
\v 38 But Paulos was_considering_worthy \add it\add* the \add >one\add* having_withdrawn from them from Pamphylia and not having_come_together with_them to the work, not to_be_taking_along_with \add ~him\add* this \add >one\add*.
\v 39 And \add +a_\add*provocation became, so_as them to_be_separated from one_another, and Barnabas having_taken Markos, to_sail_away to Cyprus.
\v 40 But Paulos having_chosen Silas, came_out having_been_given_over to_the grace of_the master by the brothers.
\v 41 And he_was_passing_through Suria/('Arām) and Cilicia, strengthening the assemblies.
\c 16
\v 1 And he_arrived also to Derbe and to Lustra. And behold, \add +a_\add* certain _disciple was there by_\add +the_\add*name Timotheos, \add +the_\add*son of_\add +a_\add* believing _woman Jewish, but \add ^his_\add*father \add was\add* of_\add +a_\add*Hellēn,
\v 2 who was_being_attested by the brothers in Lustra and Ikonion.
\v 3 Paulos wanted this \add >one\add* to_come_out with him, and having_taken he_circumcised him, because_of the Jews being in those places, for all had_known that the father of_him he_was_being \add +a_\add*Hellēn.
\v 4 And while they_were_passing_through the cities, they_were_giving_over to_them the decrees to_be_keeping having_been_judged by of_the ambassadors and elders in Hierousalēm/(Yərūshālam).
\v 5 Therefore indeed the assemblies were_being_strengthened in_the faith, and they_were_abounding in_number in_every day.
\v 6 And they_passed_through Phrygia and \add +the_\add*Galatian region, having_been_forbidden by the holy spirit to_speak the word in Asia,
\v 7 and having_come down to_Mysia, they_were_attempting to_be_gone into Bithunia, and the spirit of_Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a) not allowed them;
\v 8 and having_passed_by Mysia, they_came_down to Trōias.
\v 9 And through \add +the_\add*night \add +a_\add*vision was_seen to_Paulos, \add +a_\add* Certain Makedonian _man was having_stood and imploring him and saying: Having_passed_through into Makedonia, give_help to_us.
\v 10 And when he_saw the vision, immediately we_sought to_come_out to Makedonia, concluding that god has_called_to us to_evangelize them.
\v 11 therefore having_been_launched from Trōias, we_ran_straight to Samothrace, and on_the_ following _\add day\add* to New City,
\v 12 and_from_there to Filippou, which is \add +the_\add*leading city of_the district of_Makedonia, \add +a_\add*colony. And we_were staying in this city some days.
\v 13 And on_the day of_the sabbaths, we_came_out outside the gate by \add +a_\add*river, where we_were_thinking prayer to_be, and having_sat_down we_were_speaking to_the women having_come_together.
\v 14 And \add +a_\add*certain woman by_\add +the_\add*name Lydia, \add +a_\add*seller_of_purple of_\add +the_\add*city of_Thuateira, worshipping god was_hearing, of_whom the master opened_up her heart, to_be_taking_heed to_the \add >things\add* being_spoken by Paulos.
\v 15 And when she_was_immersed and the house of_her, she_implored saying: If you_all_have_judged me to_be faithful to_the master, having_come_in into the house of_me, be_remaining. And she_urged us.
\v 16 And it_became, of_us going to the prayer \add place\add*, \add +a_\add* certain _servant_girl having \add +a_\add* Python _spirit, to_meet with_us, who fortune-telling was_bringing_about much business for_the masters of_her.
\v 17 This \add woman\add* following after_Paulos and was_crying_out to_us saying: These men are slaves of_ the highest _god, who are_proclaiming to_you_all \add +the_\add*way of_salvation.
\v 18 And she_was_doing this for many days. But Paulos having_been_thoroughly_disturbed, and having_turned_back by_the spirit said: I_am_commanding to_you in \add +the_\add*name of_Yēsous messiah to_come_out from her. And it_came_out to_ the _same hour.
\v 19 But the masters of_her having_seen that the hope of_the business of_them, going_out, having_taken_hold_of Paulos and Silas, they_dragged \add them\add* into the marketplace before the rulers,
\v 20 and having_brought_ them _forward to_the officers, they_said: These men being Jews are_disturbing the city of_us,
\v 21 and they_are_proclaiming customs that it_is_ not _permitting for_us to_be_accepting nor to_be_practicing, being Romans.
\v 22 And the \add +a_\add*crowd rose_up_together against them, and the officers having_torn_off of_them the robes, were_commanding to_be_beating_with_rods \add them\add*.
\v 23 And having_inflicted many blows on_them, they_cast \add them\add* into prison, having_commanded to_the prison_guard to_be_keeping them securely;
\v 24 who having_received such charge, cast them into the inner prison, and secured their feet of_them in the stocks.
\v 25 But to midnight, Paulos and Silas praying, were_singing_hymns to_god, and the prisoners were_listening to_them.
\v 26 And suddenly \add +an_\add* great _earthquake became, so_that the foundations of_the prison to_be_shaken, and immediately all the doors were_opened_up, and the bonds of_all was_unfastened.
\v 27 And the prison_guard having_become awoken, and having_seen the doors of_the prison having_been_opened_up, having_drawn his sword he_was_going to_be_killing himself, thinking the prisoners to_have_escaped.
\v 28 But Paulos called with_\add +a_\add* loud _voice saying: You_may_do nothing harm to_yourself, for we_are all here.
\v 29 And having_requested lights, he_rushed_in, and having_become trembling, he_fell_before to_Paulos and Silas.
\v 30 And having_brought_ them _forth out was_saying: Sirs, what is_fitting me to_be_doing, in_order_that I_may_be_saved. 
\v 31 And they said: Believe in the master Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a) and you_will_be_being_saved, you and the household of_you.
\v 32 And they_spoke the word of_the master to_him, with all the \add >ones\add* in the house of_him.
\v 33 And having_taken them in that hour of_the night, he_washed \add them\add* from their wounds, and he_was_immersed, he and the \add >ones\add* of_him all immediately.
\v 34 And having_brought_ them _up into the house, he_set_before \add +a_\add*table \add for_them\add* and exulted with_all_the_household, having_believed in_god.
\v 35 And having_become day, the officers sent_out the policemen saying: Send_away those men.
\v 36 And the prison_guard reported the words to Paulos: The officers /Have/_sent_out, in_order_that you_all_may_be_sent_away. Therefore now having_come_out, be_going in peace.
\v 37 But Paulos was_saying to them: Having_beat us with_publicly, uncondemned men being Romans, they_cast \add us\add* into prison and now secretly they_are_casting_ us _out. For no, but having_come themselves, them_let_lead_ us _out.
\v 38 And the policemen reported these words to_the officers. And they_were_afraid having_heard that they_are Romans.
\v 39 And having_come, they_appealed to_them, and having_led_out \add them\add*, they_were_asking \add them\add* to_go_away From the city.
\v 40 And having_come_out from the prison, they_came_in to Lydia, and having_seen \add them\add*, they_exhorted the brothers and they_came_out.
\c 17
\v 1 And having_traveled_through the Amphipolis and Apollonia, they_came to Thessalonikē, where was \add +a_\add*synagogue of_the Jews.
\v 2 And according_to the \add way\add* having_been_accustomed with_Paulos, he_came_in to them, and for Three sabbaths, he_discussed with_them from the scriptures,
\v 3 opening_up and setting_before that it_was_fitting the messiah to_suffer, and to_rise_up from \add +the_\add*dead, and \add saying\add* This Yēsous, whom I am_proclaiming to_you_all is. messiah.
\v 4 And some of them were_persuaded and they_were_joined with_Paulos and Silas, both \add +a_\add* great _multitude of_the \add >ones\add* Greeks worshipping, and leading \add +a_\add*few women the not.
\v 5 But the Jews, having_been_jealous and having_taken_aside some evil men of_the marketplaces, and having_formed_a_mob, they_were_distressing the city, and having_approached to_the house of_Jason, they_were_seeking them to_bring_forth to the public.
\v 6 And not having_found them, they_were_dragging Jason and some brothers before the city_council shouting, The \add >ones\add* having_upset the inhabited_world, these are_coming here also,
\v 7 whom Jason has_welcomed; and these all are_doing in_front_of the decrees of_Kaisar, saying Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a) another king to_be.
\v 8 And they_disturbed the crowd and the city_council hearing these \add >things\add*.
\v 9 And having_taken much from Jason and the rest, they_sent_ them _away.
\v 10 And the brothers immediately sent_out both Paulos and Silas by night to Berea, who having_arrived, were_going into the synagogue of_the Jews.
\v 11 And these were more_noble \add =than\add* the \add >ones\add* in Thessalonikē, who received the word with all readiness, in_every day examining the scriptures, if these \add >things\add* might_be_having thus.
\v 12 therefore indeed Many from them believed, and not \add +a_\add*few of_the prominent Hellēn women, and men.
\v 13 But when the Jews from Thessalonikē knew that also the word of_god was_proclaimed by Paulos in, Berea, they_came also_there, agitating and disturbing the crowds.
\v 14 And then the brothers immediately Paulos sent_away, to_be_going as_far_as to the sea; and both Silas and Timotheos remained there.
\v 15 And the \add >ones\add* appointing Paulos, brought \add ~him\add* to Athēnai, and having_received \add +a_\add*commandment for Silas and Timotheos, that as they_may_come most_quickly to him, they_were_departing.
\v 16 And Paulos in Athēnai, of_awaiting them, the spirit of_him was_being_provoked in him, of_observing the city being idolatrous.
\v 17 Therefore he_was_discussing on_one_hand in the synagogue with_the Jews, and the \add >ones\add* worshipping, and in the marketplace on every day with the \add >ones\add* happening_to_be.
\v 18 On_the_other_hand some also of_the Epicureans and Stoic philosophers were_conferring with_him, and some were_saying: What might_ this _be_wanting babbler to_be_saying. But the \add others\add*: He_is_supposing to_be \add +a_\add*proclaimer of_strange demons; because he_was_gospel_preaching Yēsous and the resurrection.
\v 19 and having_taken_hold of_him, they_brought \add ~him\add* to the Aries Hill saying: Are_we_being_able to_know what \add =is\add* this new, teaching \add =is\add* being_spoken by you. 
\v 20 For you_are_carrying_in some_ surprising _\add words\add* to the ears of_us. Therefore we_are_wishing to_know what_all is_wanting these \add >things\add* to_be.
\v 21 (And all \add +the_\add*Athenians and the visiting strangers were_having_opportunity in not_one other \add >thing\add*, than to_be_telling something or to_be_hearing some newer \add >thing\add*.)
\v 22 And Paulos having_been_stood in \add +the_\add*midst of_the Aries Hill was_saying: Men, Athenians, I_am_perceiving in all \add >things\add* how more_superstitious you_all.
\v 23 For passing_through and observing the objects_of_worship of_you_all, I_ even _found \add +an_\add*altar on which had_been_inscribed: to_\add +an_\add*unknown god. Therefore you_all_are_being_devout not_knowing which, this \add >thing\add* I am_proclaiming to_you_all.
\v 24 The god having_made the earth and all the \add >things\add* in it, this \add >one\add* being master of_heaven and earth, is_dwelling neither in handmade temples,
\v 25 nor is_being_healed by human hands, additionally_needing of_anything, he giving life, and breath, and the_ all _\add >things\add* to_all;
\v 26 and he_made of one, every nation of_mankind to_be_dwelling on all \add +the_\add*face of_the earth, having_designated \add the\add* having_been_commanded times and the boundaries of_the dwelling_place of_them,
\v 27 to_be_seeking god, if perhaps surely they_might_grope for_him and might_find \add ~him\add*, also surely being not far from one each of_us.
\v 28 For we_are_living in him and are_being_moved and are, as also some of_the among you_all of_\add +the_\add*poets have_said: for we_are also of_the \add >one\add* descent.
\v 29 Therefore being descent of_god, we_ought not to_be_thinking about_gold or silver or \add +a_\add*stone mark of_\add +the_\add*craft and thoughts of_human_origin, to_be similar the divine.
\v 30 Therefore indeed god the times of_ignorance having_overlooked, now he_is_reporting the \add >things\add* to_ all _the people everywhere to_be_repenting,
\v 31 as_much_as he_set \add +a_\add*day in which he_is_going to_be_judging the inhabited_world in righteousness, by \add +a_\add*man to_whom he_designated, having_brought_about faith to_all, having_raised_ him _up from \add +the_\add*dead.
\v 32 And having_heard \add about\add* \add +a_\add*resurrection of_\add +the_\add*dead, on_one_hand they were_mocking, on_the_other_hand they said: We_will_be_hearing from_you concerning this also again.
\v 33 Thus Paulos came_out from \add +the_\add*midst of_them.
\v 34 But some men having_been_joined_together to_him, believed among whom both Dionysius the Areopagite, and \add +a_\add*woman by_\add +the_\add*name Damaris, and others with them.
\c 18
\v 1 After these \add >things\add*, having_been_departed from Athēnai, he_came to Korinthos.
\v 2 And having_found \add +a_\add*certain Jew by_\add +the_\add*name Akulas, of_Pontos by_descent, recently having_come from Italy, and Priscilla wife of_him, because_of the \add >thing\add* Claudius to_have_directed all the Jews to_be_being_departed from Ɽōmē, he_approached to_them,
\v 3 and because_of to_be the same_trade, he_was_remaining with them and they_were_working, for they_were tent_makers by_craft.
\v 4 And he_was_discussing in the synagogue on every sabbath, he_was_persuading both Jews and Greeks.
\v 5 But when both Silas and Timotheos, came_down from Makedonia, Paulos was_being_occupied with_the word, testifying to_the Jews, Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a) to_be the messiah.
\v 6 And opposing, them and slandering, having_shaken_off his clothes, he_said to them: The blood of_you_all \add be\add* on the head of_you_all; I \add =am\add* clean. From the \add time\add* now, I_will_be_going to the pagans.
\v 7 And having_departed from_there, he_came_in to \add +the_\add*house of_someone by_\add +the_\add*name of_Titos Youstos, worshipping god, of_whom the house was being_next to_the synagogue.
\v 8 And Crispus the synagogue_leader, believed in_the master with all the household of_him, and many of_the Korinthios hearing, were_believing and were_being_immersed.
\v 9 And the master said in \add +the_\add*night by \add +a_\add*vision to_Paulos: Be_ not _fearing, but be_speaking and not you_may_keep_silent,
\v 10 because I am with you, and no_one will_be_inflicting on_you to_mistreat you, because there_is many people to_me in this city.
\v 11 and he_sat_down \add +a_\add*year and six months, teaching the word of_god among them.
\v 12 But Gallio being proconsul of_Aⱪaia, the Jews stood_against with_one_accord against_Paulos, and they_led him to the tribunal
\v 13 saying, Contrary_to the law, this \add man\add* is_persuading, people to_be_worshipping god.
\v 14 But Paulos going to_be_opening_up his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews: If on_one_hand it_was \add +a_\add*certain wrong or evil crime, oh Jews, according_to \add +the_\add*matter I_had_tolerated of_you_all;
\v 15 on_the_other_hand if it_is questions about \add +a_\add*word, and names, and law, which \add =is\add* among you_all, you_all_will_be_seeing \add to_it\add* yourselves; I am_ not _wishing to_be \add +a_\add*judge of_these \add >things\add*.
\v 16 And he_drove_ them _away from the tribunal.
\v 17 And all having_taken_hold_of Sōsthenēs the synagogue_leader, they_were_striking \add ~him\add* before the tribunal. But nothing of_these \add >things\add* was_caring to_Gallio.
\v 18 And Paulos having_remained many days still, having_bid_goodbye to_the brothers, was_sailing_away to Suria/('Arām), and with him Priscilla and Akulas, having_shaved his head in Kegⱪreai, for he_was_having \add +a_\add*vow.
\v 19 And they_arrived to Efesos, and_ he_left _those there, and himself having_come_in into the synagogue, he_discussed with_the Jews.
\v 20 And them asking \add ~him\add* for more time to_remain, he_ not _consented,
\v 21 but having_bid_goodbye and having_said, I_will_be_returning to you_all Again, god willing, he_was_launched from Efesos.
\v 22 And having_come_down to Kaisarea, having_gone_up and having_greeted the assembly, he_came_down to Antioⱪeia.
\v 23 And having_worked \add +a_\add*certain time, he_came_out passing_through consecutively the Galatian region and Phrygia, strengthening all the disciples.
\v 24 And \add +a_\add* certain _Jew by_\add +the_\add*name Apollōs Alexandrian by_descent, \add +a_\add*scholarly man, arrived to Efesos, being powerful in the scriptures.
\v 25 This \add >one\add* was having_been_instructed the way of_the master, and being_zealous in_spirit, he_was_speaking and was_teaching exactly the \add >things\add* concerning Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a), knowing only the immersion of_Yōannēs.
\v 26 And this \add >one\add* began to_be_speaking_boldly in the synagogue. But having_heard from_him, Priscilla and Akulas took_ him _aside, and they_explained the way of_god more_exactly to_him.
\v 27 And about_him wishing to_pass_through into Aⱪaia, the brothers having_encouraged \add ~him\add*, wrote to_the disciples to_welcome him, who having_arrived, contributed much to_the \add >ones\add* having_believed through grace.
\v 28 For vigorously he_was_thoroughly_refuting publicly against_the Jews, showing Yēsous to_be the messiah by the scriptures.
\c 19
\v 1 And it_became at the \add time\add*, Apollōs to_be in Korinthos, Paulos having_passed_through the upper parts, to_come_down to Efesos and to_find some disciples,
\v 2 and said to them: having_believed you_all_received \add +the_\add* holy _spirit. And they \add said\add* to him: But we_ not_even _heard whether there_is holy spirit.
\v 3 and, he_said: Therefore into what were_you_all_immersed. And they said: Into the immersion of_Yōannēs.
\v 4 And Paulos said: Yōannēs immersed with_\add +a_\add*immersion of_repentance, saying to_the people that they_may_believe in the \add >one\add* coming after him this is in Yēsous.
\v 5 And having_heard, they_were_immersed in the name of_the master Yēsous.
\v 6 And of_Paulos having_laying_on on_them \add ^his_\add*hands, the holy spirit came on them, and they_were_speaking with_tongues and were_prophesying.
\v 7 And the all were men about twelve.
\v 8 And having_come_in into the synagogue, he_was_speaking_boldly for three months, discussing and persuading concerning the kingdom of_god.
\v 9 But when some were_being_hardened and were_disbelieving, speaking_evil \add of\add* the way before the multitude, having_withdrew from them he_set_apart the disciples, in_every day discussing in the school of_Tyrannus.
\v 10 And this became for two years, so_that all the \add >ones\add* dwelling_in Asia to_hear the word of_the master, both Jews and Greeks.
\v 11 And god was_doing not having_been_ordinary miracles, by the hands of_Paulos,
\v 12 so_that even to the \add >ones\add* ailing handkerchiefs or aprons to_be_being_carried_away from the skin of_him, and the diseases to_be_being_released from them, and the the evil spirits to_be_going_out.
\v 13 But some also the \add >ones\add* Jewish exorcists going_around attempted to_be_naming over the \add >ones\add* having the the evil spirits in_the name of_the master Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a) saying: I_am_imploring you_all, by_Yēsous, whom Paulos is_proclaiming.
\v 14 and seven sons of_one of_Sceva Jewish chief_priest Were doing this.
\v 15 But the evil spirit answering said to_them: Yēsous I_am_knowing, and Paulos I_am_recognizing, but who_all are you_all. 
\v 16 And the man in whom was the evil spirit having_leapt_on, on, them, having_exercised_lordship over_both, it_prevailed against against_them, so_that to_escape out_of that house naked and having_been_wounded.
\v 17 And this became known to_all, both to_Jews and Greeks, the \add >ones\add* dwelling_in Efesos, and fear fell_on on all them, and the name of_the master Yēsous was_being_magnified.
\v 18 And many of_the \add >ones\add* having_believed, were_coming confessing and declaring the practices of_them.
\v 19 And many of_the \add >ones\add* having_practiced the magical, having_brought_together their scrolls, they_were_burning_up \add them\add* before all. And they_counted_up the prices of_them, and they_found five ten_thousand of_silver.
\v 20 Thus the word of_the master was_growing with power and was_prevailing.
\v 21 And when was_fulfilled these \add >things\add*, purposed Paulos in the spirit, having_passed_through Makedonia and Aⱪaia, to_be_going to Hierousalēm/(Yərūshālam) having_said, After the \add time\add* to_become me there, it_is_fitting me also Ɽōmē to_see.
\v 22 And having_sent_out into Makedonia, two of_the \add >ones\add* serving unto_him, Timotheos and Erastos, he held_on \add +a_\add*time in Asia.
\v 23 And concerning that time, \add +a_\add* not little _disturbance became concerning the way.
\v 24 For \add +a_\add*certain silversmith by_\add +the_\add*name Dēmētrios, making temples silver of_Artemas, was_bringing_about no little business to_the craftsmen,
\v 25 whom having_convened_together also the workers about such \add >things\add*, he_said: Men, you_all_are_knowing that the prosperity to_us is from this business.
\v 26 And you_all_are_observing and are_hearing that not only Efesos, but almost of_all Asia, this Paulos having_persuaded, redirected much crowd, saying that the \add >ones\add* by /our/_hands becoming they_are not gods.
\v 27 But this is_ not only _risking_danger to_us, the trade to_come into disrepute, but also the temple of_the great goddess of_Artemas, to_be_reckoned for nothing, but of_the greatness of_her to_be_going also to_be_being_taken_down, whom all Asia and the inhabited_world is_worshipping.
\v 28 And having_heard, and having_become full of_rage, they_were_crying_out saying: Great \add =is\add* Artemas of_\add +the_\add*Ephesians.
\v 29 And the city was_filled of_confusion, and they_rushed with_one_accord to the theatre, having_seized Makedonians Gaios and Aristarⱪos, travelling_companions of_Paulos.
\v 30 But Paulos wishing to_come_in to the public, the disciples were_ not _allowing him.
\v 31 And some also of_the Asian_rulers, being friends to_him, having_sent to him, they_were_imploring \add ~him\add* not to_give himself into the theatre.
\v 32 Therefore indeed others \add +a_\add*certain other \add >thing\add* were_crying_out, for the assembly was having_been_confounded, and the more had_ not _known for_what on_account they_had_come_together.
\v 33 And out_of the crowd they_concluded Alexandros, of_the Jews having_put_ him _forward. And Alexandros having_gestured his hand, was_wanting to_be_defending to_the public.
\v 34 But having_recognized that he_is \add +a_\add*Jew, cry there_became one from all, over about two hours crying_out: Great Artemas of_\add +the_\add*Ephesians. 
\v 35 And the clerk having_calmed the crowd is_saying: Men, Ephesians, for who is of_\add +the_\add*people, who is_ not _knowing the city of_\add +the_\add*Ephesians being temple_keeper of_the great Artemas and of_the fallen_from_Zeus \add image\add*. 
\v 36 Therefore these \add >things\add* being unquestionable, it_is fitting you_all to_be_being having_been_calmed, and to_be_doing nothing reckless.
\v 37 For you_all_brought these men, neither temple-robbers nor slandering the goddess of_us.
\v 38 If therefore on_one_hand Dēmētrios and the craftsmen with him are_having \add +a_\add*matter against anyone, courts are_being_brought and there_are proconsuls, let_them_be_indicting against_one_another.
\v 39 On_the_other_hand if you_all_are_seeking_after anything concerning others, it_will_be_being_settled in the lawful assembly.
\v 40 For we_ also _are_risking_danger to_be_being_indicted of_insurrection concerning the \add day\add* today, nothing being cause, concerning which we will_ not _be_able to_give_back \add +a_\add*account concerning this disorderly_gathering. And having_said these \add >things\add*, he_sent_away the assembly.
\c 20
\v 1 And after the \add time\add* the commotion to_cease, Paulos having_sent_for the disciples and having_greeted having_exhorted, he_came_out to_be_going to Makedonia.
\v 2 And having_passed_through those districts, and having_exhorted them with_ much _speech, he_came to Greece.
\v 3 And having_worked three months, \add +a_\add*plot by the Jews having_become to_him, going to_be_being_launched into Suria/('Arām), he_became of_\add +an_\add*opinion to_be_returning through Makedonia.
\v 4 And Sopater of_Pyrrhus Berean, And of_\add +the_\add*Thessalonians Aristarⱪos and Secundus, and Gaios Derbean, and Timotheos, And \add +the_\add*Asians Tuⱪikos and Trofimos was_accompanying. with_him.
\v 5 And these having_approached were_remaining with_us in Trōias.
\v 6 And we sailed_away from Filippou after the days of_non-fermented \add bread\add*, and until five days came to them at Trōias, where we_stayed seven days.
\v 7 And on the first \add day\add* of_the week, us having_been_gathered_together to_break bread, Paulos was_discussing with_them, going to_be_departing on_the \add day\add* of_next, and was_prolonging the speech until midnight.
\v 8 And there_were many lamps in the upper_room, where we_were having_been_gathered_together.
\v 9 And \add +a_\add*certain young_man by_\add +the_\add*name Eutychus sitting by the window, being_overcome by_ deep _sleep, as_ Paulos _discussing on more, having_been_overcome by sleep, he_fell down from the third_story, and was_taken_up dead.
\v 10 But having_come_down, Paulos fell_on on_him and having_embraced \add ~him\add* said: Be_ not _being_distressed, for the life of_him is in him.
\v 11 And having_gone_up, and having_broke the bread and having_tasted \add it\add*, and for having_ much _conversed until daybreak, thus he_came_out.
\v 12 And they_brought the boy living, and were_comforted not moderately.
\v 13 But we, having_approached to the ship, were_launched to Assos, from_there going to_be_taking_up Paulos, for thus having_been_directed, he_ himself _was going to_be_going_on_foot.
\v 14 And when he_was_encountering with_us in Assos, having_taken_ him _up, we_came to Mitylene.
\v 15 And_from_there having_sailed_away, on_the_ following _\add day\add* we_arrived opposite Chios, and on_the next \add day\add* we_arrived in Samos, and on_the_ following _\add day\add* we_came to Milētos.
\v 16 For Paulos had_judged to_sail_past Efesos, so_that may_ not _become to_him to_spend_time in Asia, for he_was_hurrying if possible it_might_be to_him, the day of_pentecost to_become in Hierousalēm/(Yərūshālam).
\v 17 And from Milētos, having_sent to Efesos, he_summoned the elders of_the assembly.
\v 18 And when they_arrived to him, he_said to_them: You_all are_knowing from \add +the_\add*first day from which I_set_foot_in in Asia, how I_became with you_all the whole time,
\v 19 serving for_the master with all humility, and tears, and trials, in the plots of_the Jews having_happened; to_me;
\v 20 how I_shrunk_back nothing of_the_ benefitting _\add >things\add* to_ not _declare to_you_all, and to_teach you_all with_publicly and in \add all\add* homes,
\v 21 testifying to_ both _Jews and to_Greeks, repentance toward god and faith toward the master of_us, Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a). messiah.
\v 22 And now behold, I having_been_bound by_the spirit, am_going to Hierousalēm, not having_known the \add >things\add* in it going_to_be_meeting with_me.
\v 23 except that the holy spirit in_every city is_testifying to_me, saying that bonds and tribulations are_remaining me.
\v 24 But of_nothing account I_am_making the life precious to_myself, so_as I_may_complete the course of_me, and the service which I_received from the master Yēsous, to_testify the gospel of_the grace of_god.
\v 25 And now behold, I have_known that you_all all among whom I_passed_through proclaiming the kingdom. will_ no_longer _be_seeing. the face of_me.
\v 26 Therefore I_am_testifying to_you_all in the today day that I_am pure from the blood of_all,
\v 27 for I_ not _shrunk_back to_ not _declare all the counsel of_god to_you_all.
\v 28 Be_taking_heed to_yourselves and to_all the flock, among which the holy spirit set you_all overseers, to_be_shepherding the assembly of_the of_god, which he_procured through his his own blood.
\v 29 I have_known that after the departure of_me heavy wolves will_be_coming_in among you_all, not sparing from_the flock,
\v 30 and from of_you_all yourselves men will_be_rising_up speaking having_been_perverted \add >things\add*, of_the \add >thing\add* to_be_drawing_out disciples after themselves.
\v 31 Therefore be_watching, remembering that night and day for_three_year, I_ not _ceased admonishing each one with tears.
\v 32 And now the \add >things\add* I_am_entrusting you_all to_god, and to_the word of_the grace of_him, being_able to_build and to_give the \add +an_\add*inheritance among all the \add >ones\add* having_been_sanctified.
\v 33 I_coveted of_silver, or gold, or clothing, of_no_one.
\v 34 you_all_ yourselves _are_knowing that these hands attended to_the needs of_me and to_the \add >ones\add* being with me.
\v 35 all \add >things\add* I_showed to_you_all that thus laboring it_is_fitting to_be_taking_care of_the \add >ones\add* faltering, and to_be_remembering about_the words of_the master Yēsous that he said: it_is more blessed, to_be_giving than to_be_receiving.
\v 36 And having_said these \add >things\add*, having_knelt the knees of_him, he_prayed with them all.
\v 37 And much weeping became of_all, and having_embraced on the neck of_Paulos, they_were_kissing him,
\v 38 distressing most_of_all for the word which he_had_spoken that they_are_ no_longer _going to_be_observing the face of_him. And they_were_accompanying him to the ship.
\c 21
\v 1 And when it_became us to_be_launched, having_been_withdrawn from them, having_run_straight we_came to Cos, and on_the_ next _\add day\add* to Rhodes, and_from_there to Patara.
\v 2 And having_found \add +a_\add*ship crossing_over into Phoenicia, having_boarded we_were_launched.
\v 3 And Cyprus having_appeared, and having_left it on_\add +the_\add*left, we_were_sailing to Suria/('Arām) and we_came_down at Turos/(Tsor), for there the ship was unloading the cargo.
\v 4 And having_sought_out the disciples, we_remained_on there seven days, who were_saying by the spirit to_Paulos not to_be_setting_foot_in to Hierousalēm/(Yərūshālam).
\v 5 And when it_became to_us to_finish_out the days, having_come_out we_were_journeying, wives and children accompanying with us all, as_far_as outside the city, and having_knelt the knees on the shore having_prayed,
\v 6 we_withdrew from_one_another and we_went_up into the ship, and those returned to their own \add homes\add*.
\v 7 And we, having_completed the voyage from Turos, arrived to Ptolemais, and having_greeted the brothers, we_remained one day with them.
\v 8 And on_the \add day\add* of_next, having_come_out we_came to Kaisarea, and having_come_in into the house of_Filippos, the gospel_preacher, being of the seven, we_remained with him.
\v 9 And with_this \add man\add* were four daughters, virgins prophesying.
\v 10 And remaining_on more days, \add +a_\add*certain prophet by_\add +the_\add*name Agabus came_down from Youdaia,
\v 11 and having_come to us, and having_taken_up the belt of_Paulos, having_bound of_himself the feet and the hands, he_said: The holy spirit is_saying these \add >things\add*: The man of_whom is this belt, thus the Jews in Hierousalēm will_be_binding, and they_will_be_giving_over \add ~him\add* into \add +the_\add*hands of_\add +the_\add*pagans.
\v 12 And when we_heard these \add >things\add*, both we and the of_\add +the_\add*locals were_imploring, him not to_be_going_up to Hierousalēm.
\v 13 Then Paulos answered: What are_you_all_doing, weeping and breaking the heart of_me. For I I_am_having ready not only to_be_bound, but also to_die_off in Hierousalēm, for the name of_the master Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a).
\v 14 And him not being_persuaded, we_kept_quiet having_said: The will of_the master let_be_becoming.
\v 15 And after these days, having_made_preparations, we_were_going_up to Hierousalēm.
\v 16 And also of_the disciples from Kaisarea came_together with us, bringing \add us\add* to_Mnason \add +a_\add*certain ancient Cyprian disciple with whom we_may_be_lodged.
\v 17 And of_us having_become at Hierousalēm, the brothers gladly welcomed us.
\v 18 and on_the \add day\add* following, Paulos was_entering with us to Yakōbos/(Ya'aqov), and all the elders arrived.
\v 19 And having_greeted them, he_was_explaining by each one, of_what god did among the pagans by the service of_him.
\v 20 And they having_heard were_glorifying god, and they_said to_him: You_are_observing, brother, how_many myriads are among the Jews having_believed, and they_are_ all _being zealous for_the law.
\v 21 And they_were_instructed concerning you, that you_are_teaching apostasy from Mōsēs/(Mosheh) all Jews the \add >ones\add* among the pagans, saying them not to_be_circumcising their children, nor to_be_walking in_the customs.
\v 22 Therefore what is_it. Certainly they_will_be_hearing that you_have_come.
\v 23 Therefore do this, what we_are_saying to_you. Four Men are with_us, having \add +a_\add*vow for themselves.
\v 24 Having_taken these \add men\add*, be_purified with them and spend for them, in_order_that they_will_be_shaving his head, and all will_be_knowing that of_which they_have_been_instructed about you nothing is, but you_are_aligning also yourself, keeping the law.
\v 25 But concerning the pagans having_believed, we sent_out having_judged them to_be_keeping, from_the jointly idol_sacrificed \add >thing\add*, and blood, and strangled \add animals\add*, and sexual_immorality.
\v 26 Then Paulos having_taken the men, on_the following day with them having_been_purified, was_entering into the temple, proclaiming the fulfillment of_the days of_the purification, until of_which the offering was_offered for each one of_them.
\v 27 And when the seven days were_going, to_be_being_completed, the Jews from Asia, having_seen him in the temple, were_confounding all the crowd, and they_laid_on their hands on him
\v 28 crying_out: Men, Israēl/(Yisərā'ēl)ites, be_giving_help. This is the man, who teaching all everywhere against the people, and the law, and this place, and still also brought_in Greeks into the temple, and has_defiled this holy place.
\v 29 For they_were having_previously_seen Trofimos the Ephesian in the city with him, whom they_were_thinking that Paulos brought_in into the temple.
\v 30 And the whole city was_stirred, and \add +a_\add*rushing_together of_the people became, and having_taken_hold of_Paulos, they_were_dragging him outside the temple, and immediately the doors were_shut.
\v 31 and seeking to_kill_ him _off, there_went_up \add +an_\add*allegation to_the commander of_the cohort, that all Hierousalēm/(Yərūshālam) is_being_confounded,
\v 32 who immediately having_taken soldiers and centurions, ran_down on them, and having_seen the commander and the soldiers, they_ceased striking Paulos.
\v 33 Then having_neared, the commander took_hold of_him, and commanded \add ~him\add* to_be_bound with_ two _chains, and he_was_inquiring who he_might_be and what he_is having_done.
\v 34 But others, were_crying_out some other \add >thing\add* in the crowd. And him not of_being_able to_know the certain \add >thing\add* because_of the commotion, he_commanded him to_be_being_brought into the barracks.
\v 35 And when he_became to the stairs, it_happened him to_be_being_borne by the soldiers, because_of the force of_the crowd.
\v 36 For the multitude of_the people was_following crying_out: Be_Taking_ him _away.
\v 37 And going to_be_being_brought_in into the barracks, Paulos is_saying to_the commander: is_it_permitting to_me to_say something to you. And he was_saying: You_are_knowing In_Hellēn. 
\v 38 Consequently are you not the Aiguptos/(Miʦərayim)ian, who before these days, having_upset and having_led_out the four_thousand men of_the assassins into the desert. 
\v 39 But Paulos said: On_one_hand I am \add +a_\add*Jewish \add +a_\add*man, Tarsian, of_Cilicia, \add +a_\add*citizen of_\add +an_\add* not _insignificant city. On_the_other_hand I_am_beseeching of_you, permit to_me to_speak to the people.
\v 40 And of_ him _having_permitted, Paulos having_stood on the stairs, gestured with_his hand to_the people, and great silence having_become, he_called_out in_his Hebrew language saying,
\c 22
\v 1 Men, brothers, and fathers, hear to you_all now of_\add +the_\add*defense of_me.
\v 2 (And having_heard that he_was_calling_out to_them in_the Hebrew language, they_brought_about more quietness.) And he_is_saying:
\v 3 I am \add +a_\add* Jewish _man, having_been_born in Tarsus of_Cilicia, but having_been_brought_up in this city, before the feet of_Gamaliel, having_been_instructed according_to \add +the_\add*exactness of_our ancestral law, being zealous for_god, as all you_all are today,
\v 4 who I_persecuted this Way until death, binding and giving_over to prisons, both men and women,
\v 5 as also the chief_priest was_testifying to_me and all the council_of_elders; from whom also having_received letters to the brothers, I_was_going to Damaskos/(Ddammeseq), going_to_ also _bring the \add >ones\add* being there, having_been_bound to Hierousalēm/(Yərūshālam), in_order_that they_may_be_punished.
\v 6 But it_became to_me journeying, and nearing to_Damaskos about midday, suddenly much light from the sky to_flash_around around me.
\v 7 And I_fell to the ground, and I_heard of_\add +a_\add*voice saying to_me: Saul, Saul, why are_you_persecuting me. 
\v 8 And I answered: Who are_you, lord. And he_said to me: I am Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a) the Nazarene, whom you are_persecuting.
\v 9 And the \add >ones\add* being with me, on_one_hand they_saw the light, on_the_other_hand they_ not _heard the voice of_the \add >one\add* speaking to_me.
\v 10 And I_said What may_I_do, master. And the master said to me: Having_risen_up be_going to Damaskos, and_there will_be_being_spoken to_you concerning all \add >things\add* that has_been_determined for_you to_do.
\v 11 But as I_was_ not _focusing_in because_of the glory of_that light, being_led_by_hand by the \add >ones\add* being_with with_me, I_came to Damaskos.
\v 12 And Ananias \add +a_\add*certain devout man according_to the law, being_attested by all the Jews dwelling \add there\add*,
\v 13 having_come to me and having_stood_by, he_said to_me: Saul, brother, receive_sight. And_I looked_up on him to_ the _same hour.
\v 14 And he said: The god of_the fathers of_us appointed you to_know the will of_him, and to_see the Righteous \add One\add*, and to_hear \add +the_\add*voice out_of the mouth of_him.
\v 15 Because you_will_be \add +a_\add*witness for_him to all people, of_what \add >things\add* you_have_seen and heard.
\v 16 And now why are_you_waiting. Having_risen_up, immerse and wash_away the sins of_you, having_appealed to_the name of_him.
\v 17 And it_became to_me, having_returned to Hierousalēm, and praying of_me in the temple, me to_become in \add +a_\add*trance,
\v 18 and to_see him saying to_me: Hurry and come_out with quickness out_of Hierousalēm, because they will_ not _be_accepting of_you \add +the_\add*testimony concerning me.
\v 19 And_I said: master, they are_knowing that I was imprisoning and beating in the synagogues, the \add >ones\add* believing in you.
\v 20 And when the blood of_Stephen the witness of_you, was_being_poured_out, I_ myself _was also having_stood_by, and consenting, and keeping the clothes of_the \add >ones\add* killing him.
\v 21 And he_said to me: Be_going, because I will_be_sending_ you _away to far pagans.
\v 22 And they_were_hearing from_him until this word, and they_lifted_up the voice of_them saying: Be_taking_away such \add man\add* from the earth, for it_was_ not _befitting him to_be_living. 
\v 23 and them Crying_out, and throwing_down their clothes, and casting dust into the air,
\v 24 the commander commanded him to_be_being_brought_in into the barracks, having_said him to_be_being_interrogated by_floggings, in_order_that he_may_know for what cause they_were_crying_out thus to_him.
\v 25 But as they_stretched_ him _out with_the straps, Paulos said to the centurion having_stood, is_it_permitting to_you_all to_be_flogging \add +a_\add*man Roman and uncondemned. 
\v 26 And having_heard \add it\add* the centurion, having_approached to_the commander, he_reported saying: What are_you_going to_be_doing. For this man is \add +a_\add*Roman.
\v 27 And having_approached, the commander said to_him: Be_telling to_me, are you \add +a_\add*Roman. And he was_saying: Yes.
\v 28 and the commander answered: I this acquired citizenship of_\add +a_\add*great sum. But Paulos was_saying: But I even have_been_born \add free\add*.
\v 29 Therefore the \add >ones\add* going to_be_interrogating him immediately withdrew from him, the also and was_ commander _afraid, having_learned that he_is \add +a_\add*Roman, and because he_was having_bound him.
\v 30 But on_the \add day\add* of_next, wishing to_know for_certain, why he_is_being_accused by the Jews, he_released him, and commanded the chief_priests and all the Sanhedrin, to_come_together; and having_brought_down Paulos, he_set \add ~him\add* among them.
\c 23
\v 1 And Paulos having_looked_intently at_the Sanhedrin said: Men, brothers, I in_all conscience have_lived_as_citizen good to_god until this day.
\v 2 And Ananias the chief_priest commanded to_the \add >ones\add* having_stood_by him, to_be_striking the mouth of_him.
\v 3 Then Paulos said to him: god is_going to_be_striking you, wall having_been_whitewashed. And are_ you _sitting judging me according_to the law, and you_are_ violating_law _commanding me to_be_being_struck. 
\v 4 But the \add >ones\add* having_stood_by said: Are_you_insulting the chief_priest of_god. 
\v 5 And Paulos was_saying: I_had_ not _known, brothers, that he_is \add +a_\add*chief_priest; for it_has_been_written, you will_ not _be_speaking wrongly \add +a_\add*ruler of_the people of_you.
\v 6 But Paulos having_known that one part is of_Saddoukaios_sect, but the \add +the_\add*other of_Farisaios_sect, he_was_crying_out in the Sanhedrin: Men, brothers, I am \add +a_\add*Farisaios_sect_member, \add +the_\add*son of_Farisaios_sect; I am_being_judged concerning \add +the_\add*hope and resurrection of_\add +the_\add*dead.
\v 7 And of_him speaking this, \add +a_\add*dissension became ˱between˲_the Farisaios_sect and Saddoukaios_sect, and the multitude was_divided.
\v 8 For indeed \add +the_\add*Saddoukaios_sect are_saying to_be no resurrection, neither \add +an_\add*angel, nor \add +a_\add*spirit, But \add +the_\add*Farisaios_sect are_confessing both.
\v 9 And \add +a_\add* great _clamor became, and some of_the scribes of_the side of_the Farisaios_sect having_stood_up, they_were_contending saying: We_are_finding nothing evil in this man; and \add what\add* if \add +a_\add*spirit spoke to_him, or \add +an_\add*angel. 
\v 10 And becoming great, dissension, the commander having_been_afraid lest Paulos may_be_torn_apart by them, commanded the army having_come_down, to_snatch him from midst of_them, and to_be_bringing \add ~him\add* into the barracks.
\v 11 But on_the following night, the master having_approached to_him, said: Be_having_courage, for as you_testified the \add >things\add* about me at Hierousalēm/(Yərūshālam), thus it_is_fitting you to_testify also at Ɽōmē.
\v 12 And it_having_become day, the Jews having_made \add +a_\add*disorderly_gathering, cursed themselves, saying neither to_eat nor to_drink, until of_which they_may_kill_off Paulos.
\v 13 And were more \add =than\add* forty the \add >ones\add* in_this having_made conspiracy;
\v 14 who having_approached to_the chief_priests and the elders said: ˱With˲_\add +a_\add*curse we_cursed ourselves, to_taste of_nothing until of_which we_may_kill_off Paulos.
\v 15 Therefore now you_all with the Sanhedrin report to_the commander, so_that he_may_bring_ him _down to you_all, as going to_be_investigating more_exactly the \add >things\add* concerning him; and we are ready to_kill him before the \add time\add* him to_near, .
\v 16 But the son of_the sister of_Paulos having_heard, the ambush having_arrived, and having_come_in into the barracks, he_reported \add it\add* to_Paulos.
\v 17 And Paulos having_called_to one of_the centurions, he_was_saying, be_bringing_up this young_man to the commander, for he_is_having something to_report to_him.
\v 18 Therefore indeed the \add >one\add* having_taken him, brought \add ~him\add* to the commander, and he_is_saying: The prisoner, Paulos, having_called_to me, asked to_lead this young_man to you, having something to_tell to_you.
\v 19 And the commander having_taken_hold of_the hand of_him, and having_withdrawn by himself, he_was_inquiring: What is \add it\add* that you_are_having to_report to_me. 
\v 20 And he_said, The Jews decided to_ask you, so_that tomorrow you_may_bring_down Paulos into the Sanhedrin, as going to_be_inquiring something more_exactly concerning him.
\v 21 Therefore you may_ not _be_persuaded by_them, for forty of them men \add =than\add* more are_lying_in_wait him, who cursed themselves neither to_eat nor to_drink, until of_which they_may_kill him, and now they_are ready, waiting_for the promise from you.
\v 22 Therefore indeed the commander sent_away the young_man having_commanded: To_tell to_no_one that you_reported these \add >things\add* to me.
\v 23 And having_called_to some two of_the centurions, he_said: Prepare two_hundred soldiers, so_that may_be_gone as_far_as Kaisarea, and seventy horsemen, and two_hundred spearmen for \add +the_\add*third hour of_the night.
\v 24 And mounts to_present, in_order_that having_mounted Paulos, they_may_bring_safely_through \add ~him\add* to Felix the governor,
\v 25 having_written \add +a_\add*letter, having this pattern:
\v 26 Claudius Lysias, to_be_greeting to_the most_excellent governor Felix.
\v 27 this man having_been_captured by the Jews, and going to_be_being_killed by them, having_approached with their army, I_rescued \add ~him\add* having_learned that he_is \add +a_\add*Roman.
\v 28 And wishing to_know the charge because_of which they_were_indicting against_him, I_brought_down \add ~him\add* to the Sanhedrin of_them.
\v 29 Whom I_found being_indicted concerning questions of_the law of_them, but nothing having indictment worthy of_death or of_bonds.
\v 30 And having_been_divulged to_me of_\add +a_\add*plot going_to_be against the man, I_sent \add ~him\add* from them to you, having_ also _commanded to_the accusers them to_be_speaking before you.
\v 31 Therefore indeed the soldiers according_to the \add >thing\add* having_been_directed to_them, having_taken_up Paulos, brought \add ~him\add* by night to Antipatris.
\v 32 But on_the \add day\add* of_ next, having_allowed the horsemen to_be_going_away with him, they_returned to the barracks;
\v 33 who having_come_in into Kaisarea, and having_delivered_up the letter to_the governor, they_ also _presented Paulos to_him.
\v 34 And having_read \add it\add*, and having_asked of what province he_is, and having_learned that \add he_is\add* from Cilicia,
\v 35 he_was_saying I_will_be_thoroughly_hearing from_you: whenever also the accusers of_you may_arrive, having_commanded for_him to_be_being_guarded in the praetorium of_Hērōdēs.
\c 24
\v 1 And after five days, Ananias the chief_priest came_down with some elders, and Tertullus \add +a_\add*certain \add +an_\add*attorney, who reported to_the governor against Paulos.
\v 2 And of_him having_been_called, Tertullus began to_be_accusing \add ~him\add* saying: Of_great peace obtaining through you, and of_\add +the_\add*reforms becoming to_ this _nation through your provision,
\v 3 both everything and everywhere, most_excellent Felix we_are_welcoming \add it\add*, with all thanksgiving.
\v 4 But in_order_that I _may_ not _be_hindering more for you, in_your gentleness I_am_imploring you to_hear from_us briefly.
\v 5 For having_found this man \add +a_\add*pestilence, and stirring insurrections to_all the Jews in the inhabited_world, and \add +a_\add*ring_leader of_the of_the Nazarenes sect,
\v 6 who even attempted to_profane the temple, also whom we_apprehended.
\v 7
\v 8 from whom you_will_be_able yourself, having_examined \add ~him\add* concerning all these \add >things\add*, to_know of_which \add >things\add* we are_accusing against_him.
\v 9 And the Jews also piled_on, alleging these \add >things\add* to_be_having thus.
\v 10 And Paulos answered, the governor having_nodded to_him to_be_speaking, this for many years you being judge to_nation Knowing, I_am_ cheerfully _defending the \add >things\add* concerning myself.
\v 11 Of_you being_able to_know that there_are not more to_me twelve days, from which I_went_up going_to_worship in Hierousalēm/(Yərūshālam).
\v 12 And they_found me neither in the temple discussing with anyone or making \add +a_\add*opposition of_\add +a_\add*crowd, neither in the synagogues, nor in the city,
\v 13 nor are_they_being_able to_stand_by to_you, concerning which now they_are_accusing against_me.
\v 14 But I_am_confessing this to_you that according_to the Way which they_are_calling \add +a_\add*sect, thus I_am_serving unto_the ancestral god, believing in_all the \add >things\add* throughout the law and in_the \add >things\add* having_been_written in the prophets,
\v 15 having \add +a_\add*hope in god, which also these themselves are_waiting_for, \add +a_\add*resurrection to_be_going going_to_be, of_\add +the_\add*righteous both and of_\add +the_\add*unrighteous.
\v 16 In this also I_ myself _am_exercising, \add +a_\add* inoffensive _conscience to_be_having toward god and people through everything.
\v 17 And through more years I_arrived going_to_make alms to the nation of_me and offerings,
\v 18 at which they_found me in the temple having_been_purified, neither with \add +a_\add*crowd, nor with commotion.
\v 19 But some Jews from Asia, who it_was_fitting to_be_being_present before you and to_be_accusing, if anything might_be_having against me.
\v 20 Or let_ these themselves _say, what they_found wrong, having_stood of_me before the Sanhedrin,
\v 21 than concerning this one voice, which I_cried_out among them having_stood: I am_being_judged by you_all today concerning \add +the_\add*resurrection of_\add +the_\add*dead.
\v 22 But Felix he_put_off them, having_known more_exactly the \add >things\add* concerning the Way, having_said: Whenever Lysias the commander may_come_down, I_will_be_investigating the \add >things\add* concerning you_all;
\v 23 having_directed to_the centurion him to_be_being_kept, and to_be_having relaxation, and to_be_forbidding no_one of_his own \add people\add* of_him to_be_attending to_him.
\v 24 But after some days, Felix having_arrived with Drusilla, his own wife being \add +a_\add*Jew, he_sent_for Paulos, and heard from_him concerning the faith in messiah.
\v 25 But him discussing concerning righteousness, and self-control, and the judgment coming, Felix having_become frightened, answered: the_ Present _\add time\add* being be_going, and having_taken time, I_will_be_summoning you.
\v 26 Together also hoping that money will_be_being_given to_him by Paulos, therefore also more_frequently sending_for him, he_was_conversing with_him.
\v 27 But two_years having_been_fulfilled, Felix received successor Porcius Festus; and wanting to_grant \add +a_\add*favor to_the Jews, Felix left Paulos having_been_bound.
\c 25
\v 1 Therefore Festus having_set_foot_in in_the province after three, days went_up to Hierousalēm/(Yərūshālam) from Kaisarea.
\v 2 And the chief_priests and the leaders of_the Jews reported to_him against Paulos, and they_were_imploring him,
\v 3 requesting \add +a_\add*favor against him, so_that he_may_send_for him to Hierousalēm (making \add +an_\add*ambush to_kill him on the way).
\v 4 Therefore indeed Festus answered, Paulos to_be_being_kept in Kaisarea, and himself to_be_going in quickness to_be_going_out.
\v 5 Therefore the powerful \add >ones\add* among you_all: he_is_saying, having_gone_down_with, if anything perverse is in the man, them _let_be_accusing against_him.
\v 6 And having_stayed among them not more eight or ten days, having_come_down to Kaisarea, on_the \add day\add* of_next having_sat_down on the tribunal, he_commanded Paulos to_be_brought.
\v 7 And of_him having_arrived, the Jews having_come_down from Hierousalēm stood_around him, bringing_against many and heavy charges, which they_were_ not _able to_demonstrate,
\v 8 of_Paulos defending, I_sinned neither against the law of_the Jews, nor against the temple, nor anything against Kaisar.
\v 9 But Festus wanting to_grant favor with_the Jews, answering to_Paulos he_said: Are_you_willing to having_gone_up Hierousalēm concerning these \add >things\add* to_be_judged there before me. 
\v 10 But Paulos said: Before the tribunal of_Kaisar having_stood I_am, where it_is_fitting me to_be_being_judged. I_have_done_ nothing _wrong To_\add +the_\add*Jews, as also you very_well are_knowing.
\v 11 Therefore if on_one_hand I_am_doing_wrong and I_have_done anything worthy of_death, I_am_ not _refusing to_die_off; on_the_other_hand if nothing is \add true\add* of_which these are_accusing against_me, no_one is_able to_grant me to_them. I_am_Appealing to_Kaisar. 
\v 12 Then Festus having_conversed_with with the counsel, answered: You_have_appealed to_Kaisar, you_will_be_going to Kaisar. 
\v 13 And some days having_elapsed, Agrippa the king and Bernice arrived to Kaisarea, having_greeted Festus.
\v 14 And as they_were_staying there more days, Festus placed_before before_the king the \add >things\add* concerning Paulos saying, certain \add +a_\add*man ˱There˲_is, \add +a_\add*prisoner having_been_left by Felix,
\v 15 concerning whom of_me having_become in Hierousalēm, the chief_priests and the elders of_the Jews reported, requesting conviction against him;
\v 16 to whom I_answered that it_is not \add +the_\add*custom with_Romans to_be_granting any person before the \add >one\add* being_accused, might_be_having to face the accusers and \add +the_\add*place of_defense might_take concerning the indictment.
\v 17 Therefore of_them having_come_together, here, having_made not_one delay, on_the_ next _\add day\add* having_sat_down on the tribunal, I_commanded the man to_be_brought;
\v 18 concerning whom the accusers having_been_stood they_were_bringing not_one charge, of_which I was_suspecting evil \add >ones\add*.
\v 19 But they_were_having against him some questions concerning their own superstition, and concerning \add +a_\add*certain Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a) having_died, whom Paulos was_alleging to_be_living.
\v 20 And I perplexing, the debate concerning these \add >things\add*, was_asking if might_be_wishing to_be_going to Hierousalēm/(Yərūshālam), and_there to_be_being_judged concerning these \add >things\add*.
\v 21 But Paulos having_appealed to_be_kept himself for the investigation of_the Emperor, I_commanded him to_be_being_kept, until of_which I_may_send_ him _up to Kaisar.
\v 22 And Agrippa \add said\add* to Festus: I_was_wishing also myself to_hear from_the man. Tomorrow, he_is_saying: you_will_be_hearing from_him.
\v 23 Therefore on_the \add day\add* of_next, Agrippa and Bernice having_come with great pageantry, and having_come_in into the auditorium with both commanders and men in prominence in_the city, and having_commanded Festus, Paulos was_brought.
\v 24 And Festus is_saying: king Agrippa, and all you_all being_present_with with_us, men, you_all_are_observing this \add >one\add*, concerning whom all the multitude of_the Jews pleaded with_me, in both Hierousalēm and here, shouting not to_be_fitting him to_be_living no_longer.
\v 25 But I grasped him to_have_done nothing worthy of_death, and this \add >one\add* himself having_appealed to_the Emperor, I_judged to_be_sending \add ~him\add*.
\v 26 Concerning whom I_am_ not _having any certain to_write to_my lord. Therefore I_brought_ him _forth before you_all, and most_of_all before you, king Agrippa, so_that the examination having_become, I_may_have something I_may_write.
\v 27 For it_is_supposing to_me illogical sending \add +a_\add*prisoner, not also to_signify the charges against him.
\c 26
\v 1 And Agrippa was_saying to Paulos: It_is_being_permitted to_you to_be_speaking concerning yourself. Then Paulos having_stretched_out his hand was_defending,
\v 2 Concerning all of_which I_am_being_indicted by \add +the_\add*Jews, king Agrippa, I_have_considered myself blessed going to_be_defending before you, today.
\v 3 Most_of_all you being knowledgeable_one of_all the among \add +the_\add*Jews, of_ both _customs and questions; therefore I_am_beseeching \add you\add* patiently to_hear from_me.
\v 4 Therefore indeed the livelihood of_me, from youth from \add +the_\add*beginning having_become among the nation of_me and in Hierousalēm, all Jews have_known,
\v 5 knowing_before me originally, if they_may_be_willing to_be_testifying that according_to the most_exact sect of_our religion, I_lived \add +a_\add*Farisaios_sect_member.
\v 6 And now for \add +the_\add*hope of_the promise to the fathers of_us, having_become by god, I_have_stood being_judged,
\v 7 to which the twelve_tribes of_us serving night and day in earnestness, is_hoping to_attain; concerning which \add +the_\add*hope I_am_being_indicted by \add +the_\add*Jews, king.
\v 8 Why is_it_being_judged unbelievable by you_all, if god is_raising \add +the_\add*dead. 
\v 9 Therefore indeed I supposed to_myself it_to_be_fitting to_do many contrary \add >things\add* to the name of_Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a) of_Nazarene.
\v 10 Which also I_did in Hierousalēm/(Yərūshālam), and many both of_the holy \add >ones\add* I locked_up in prisons, having_received the authority from the chief_priests, and of_them being_killed, I_brought_ \add +a_\add*vote _against \add them\add*.
\v 11 And in all the synagogues, often punishing them, I_was_compelling \add them\add* to_be_slandering, and exceedingly raging_against against_them, I_was_persecuting \add them\add* as_far_as even to the outside cities.
\v 12 At which journeying to Damaskos/(Ddammeseq), with \add +the_\add*authority and permission of_the chief_priests,
\v 13 middle day on the road king I_saw, from_heaven \add +a_\add*light above the brightness \add like\add* of_the sun having_shone_around me, and the \add >ones\add* journeying with me.
\v 14 And all of_us having_falling_down to the ground, I_heard \add +a_\add*voice, saying to me in_the Hebrew language: Saul, Saul, why are_you_persecuting me. \add It_is\add* hard for_you to_be_kicking against \add +the_\add*prods.
\v 15 And I said: Who you_are, lord. And the master said: I am Yēsous, whom you are_persecuting.
\v 16 But rise_up, and stand on the feet of_you; for I_was_seen by_you in this, to_appoint you \add +a_\add*attendant and \add +a_\add*witness, both of_which you_saw me and of_which I_will_be_being_seen by_you,
\v 17 rescuing you from the people and from the pagans, to whom I am_sending_ you _out,
\v 18 to_open_up eyes of_them, for_that to_turn_back from darkness to light, and from_the power of_Satan/(Sāţān) to god, for_that them to_receive forgiveness of_sins and lot among the \add >ones\add* having_been_sanctified by_faith in me.
\v 19 Whence, king Agrippa, I_became not unpersuadable to_the heavenly vision,
\v 20 but to_the \add >ones\add* in Damaskos first and both, in_Hierousalēm, and all the region of_Youdaia, and to_the pagans, I_was_reporting to_be_repenting and to_be_turning_back to god, worthy of_ works _repentance doing.
\v 21 On_account these \add >things\add*, \add +the_\add*Jews having_captured me in the temple, were_attempting to_hand_over \add me\add*.
\v 22 Therefore having_obtained of_help from god until this day, I_have_stood testifying to_small both and to_great, nothing besides saying of_what \add >things\add* both the prophets and Mōsēs/(Mosheh) spoke going to_be_becoming,
\v 23 the messiah if suffering, if first by resurrection from_\add +the_\add*dead, is_going to_be_proclaiming light both to_\add +the_\add*people and the pagans.
\v 24 And of_him defending these \add >things\add*, Festus with_loud voice is_saying: You_are_raving_mad, Paulos. The great learning is_turning you to madness. 
\v 25 But Paulos: Is_saying I_am_ not _raving_mad: most_excellent Festus, but I_am_speaking_out words of_truth and sobriety.
\v 26 For the king is_understanding concerning these \add >things\add*, to whom I_am_ also _speaking speaking_boldly; for I_am_being_persuaded nothing to_be_escaping_notice him anything of_these \add >things\add* not, for this is not having_been_done in \add +a_\add*corner.
\v 27 king Agrippa are_you_believing, in_the prophets. I_have_known that you_are_believing.
\v 28 And Agrippa \add said\add* to Paulos: Are_you_persuading me in \add +a_\add*little \add time\add* to_make \add +a_\add*follower_of_the_messiah. 
\v 29 And Paulos \add said\add*: I_might_hope to_god, both in \add +a_\add*little \add time\add* and in \add +a_\add*great \add time\add*, not only you, but also all the \add >ones\add* hearing from_me today, to_become such what_kind also_I am, except of_ these _bonds.
\v 30 both the king and the governor Stood_up, both Bernice and the \add >ones\add* sitting_with with_them,
\v 31 and having_withdrawn they_were_speaking to one_another saying, This man any not_one worthy \add >thing\add* of_death or of_bonds is_doing.
\v 32 And Agrippa was_saying to_Festus: This man was_able to_have_sent_away, except he_had_appealed Kaisar.
\c 27
\v 1 And when it_was_judged us to_be_sailing_away to Italy, they_were_giving_over both Paulos and some other prisoners, to_\add +a_\add*centurion by_\add +the_\add*name Julius, of_\add +the_\add*cohort of_Augustus.
\v 2 And having_boarded on_\add +a_\add* Adramyttium _ship, we_were_launched going to_be_sailing to the places along Asia, of_Aristarⱪos being with us, \add +a_\add*Makedonian of_Thessalonian.
\v 3 Both on_the next \add day\add* we_were_set_down at Sidōn/(Tsīdōn), and Julius having_given_treatment with_human_kindness to_Paulos, he_permitted \add ~him\add* having_been_gone to his friends, to_obtain of_care.
\v 4 And_from_there having_been_launched, we_sailed_under Cyprus, because_of that the winds to_be contrary.
\v 5 And having_sailed_across the sea along Cilicia and Pamphylia, we_came_down to Myra of_Lycia.
\v 6 And_there the centurion having_found \add +a_\add* Alexandrian _ship, sailing to Italy, he_placed_in us into it.
\v 7 And in many days, slow_sailing and with_difficulty, having_become along Cnidus, the wind not further_permitting us, we_sailed_under Krētē along Salmōn/(Saləmōn)e.
\v 8 And sailing_along it with_difficulty, we_came to \add +a_\add* certain _place being_called Beautiful Harbors, to_which was near \add +the_\add*city Lasaea.
\v 9 And much time having_elapsed, and the voyage already being dangerous, because_of that even the fasting already to_have_passed_by, Paulos was_advising \add them\add*
\v 10 saying to_them: Men, I_am_perceiving that the voyage to_be_going going_to_be with damage and much loss, not only of_the cargo and to_the ship, but also the lives of_us.
\v 11 But the centurion was_being_persuaded by_the captain and the ship_owner rather, than by_the \add >things\add* being_spoken by Paulos.
\v 12 And the harbor being unsuitable to winter, the more presented \add +a_\add*counsel to_be_launched from_there, if somehow they_might_be_able, having_arrived at Phoenix, to_winter \add +a_\add*harbor of_Krētē, looking to \add +the_\add*southwest and to \add +the_\add*northwest.
\v 13 And of_\add +a_\add*south_wind having_blown_gently, having_supposed of_the purpose to_have_taken_hold, having_taken_up they_were_sailing_along near Krētē.
\v 14 But after not much \add time\add*, \add +a_\add* typhoon _wind, being_called \add +the_\add*Euraquilo cast down. from_it.
\v 15 And the ship having_been_seized, and not being_able to_be_facing to_the wind, having_given_up we_were_being_driven_along.
\v 16 And having_run_under \add +a_\add*certain island being_called Clauda, we_were_able with_difficulty to_become control of_the lifeboat,
\v 17 which having_taken_up, they_were_resorting to_helps, undergirding the ship. And fearing lest they_may_run_aground into the \add shallows_of\add* Syrtis, having_lowered the gear, thus they_were_being_driven_along.
\v 18 And of_us being_ violently _storm_tossed, on_the_ next _\add day\add* they_were_making \add +a_\add*jettison,
\v 19 and on_the third \add day\add*, they_threw_down the tackle of_the ship \add ^their_\add*own_hands.
\v 20 And neither sun nor stars appearing for more days, and no little storm laying_on \add us\add*, furthermore all hope, us to_be_being_saved was_being_taken_away.
\v 21 And of_much abstinence being, then Paulos having_been_stood in midst of_them said: It_was_fitting indeed, oh men, having_yielded to_me, not to_be_being_launched from Krētē, and to_gain this damage, and the loss.
\v 22 And_yet now I_am_advising you_all the \add >things\add* to_be_cheering_up, for not_one loss of_life will_be of you_all, except of_the ship.
\v 23 For \add +an_\add*angel of_god stood_by me this night, of_whose I_am, unto_whom also I_am_serving,
\v 24 saying: Be_ not _fearing, Paulos; it_is_fitting you to_stand_before before_Kaisar, and behold, god has_granted to_you all the \add >ones\add* sailing with you.
\v 25 Therefore be_cheering_up, men, for I_am_believing in_ god that thus it_will_be, according_to which manner it_has_been_spoken to_me.
\v 26 But it_is_fitting us to_run_aground on \add +a_\add*certain island.
\v 27 But when \add +the_\add*fourteenth night became, us being_carried_through in the Adriatic_Sea, to \add +the_\add*middle of_the night, the sailors were_suspecting \add +a_\add*certain to_be_coming_near to_them land.
\v 28 And having_taken_soundings, they_found twenty fathoms, and \add +a_\add*little \add time\add* having_passed_by, and again having_taken_soundings, they_found fifteen fathoms.
\v 29 And fearing lest we_may_run_aground somewhere on rough places, having_thrown_down four anchors from \add +the_\add*stern, they_were_hoping for_day to_become.
\v 30 And \add +the_\add*sailors seeking to_flee out_of the ship, and having_lowered the lifeboat into the sea, on_under_pretense as going to_be_stretching_out anchors from \add +the_\add*bow,
\v 31 Paulos said to_the centurion and to_the soldiers: If these may_ not _remain in the ship, you_all are_ not _being_able to_be_saved.
\v 32 Then the soldiers cut_off the ropes of_the lifeboat, and they_allowed her to_run_aground.
\v 33 And until of_which day was_going to_be_becoming, Paulos was_exhorting all, to_partake of_food saying: Today \add +the_\add*fourteenth day \add =is\add*, you_all_are_continuing waiting foodless, having_taken nothing.
\v 34 Therefore I_am_exhorting you_all to_partake of_food, for this is_being for your salvation; for \add +a_\add*hair from the head of_no_one of_you_all will_be_perishing.
\v 35 And having_said these \add >things\add*, and having_taken bread, he_gave_thanks to_god before all, and having_broke \add it\add*, he_began to_be_eating.
\v 36 And all having_become cheerful, they also received of_food.
\v 37 And we_were all souls in the ship, two_hundred seventy six.
\v 38 And having_been_satiated of_food, they_were_lightening the ship, casting_out the wheat into the sea.
\v 39 And when day became, they_were_ not _recognizing the land, but were_observing \add +a_\add*certain bay having \add +a_\add*shore, on which they_were_counselling, if they_might_be_able to_preserve the ship.
\v 40 And having_cut_away the anchors, they_were_allowing \add them\add* in the sea, at_once having_unfastened the ropes of_the rudders, and having_lifted_up the foresail to_the \add wind\add* blowing, they_were_keeping for the shore.
\v 41 But having_fallen_among into \add +a_\add*place two_sea, they_ran_ the ship _aground, and on_one_hand the bow having_stuck remained unshakeable, on_the_other_hand the stern was_being_destroyed by the force.
\v 42 And of_the soldiers, \add +the_\add*counsel became that they_may_kill_off the prisoners, lest anyone having_swum_away may_escape.
\v 43 But the centurion wishing to_bring_ Paulos _safely_through, forbade them of_their counsel, and he_commanded the \add >ones\add* being_able to_be_swimming, having_thrown_off \add themselves\add* first, to_be_departing on the land,
\v 44 and the rest, on_one_hand some on planks, on_the_other_hand some on some \add >things\add* from the ship. And thus it_became, all to_be_brought_safely_through to the land.
\c 28
\v 1 And having_been_brought_safely_through, then we_learned that the island is_being_called Melita.
\v 2 And the foreigners were_bringing_about not \add just\add* the having_been_ordinary human_kindness to_us, for having_lit \add +a_\add*fire, they_received all us, because_of the rain having_approached, and because_of the cold.
\v 3 But Paulos having_gathered some multitude of_sticks, and having_laid_on \add them\add* on the fire, \add +a_\add*viper having_come_out from the heat, clamped_down on_the hand of_him.
\v 4 And when the foreigners saw the wild_beast being_hanged from the hand of_him, they_were_saying to one_another: Certainly this man is \add +a_\add*murderer, whom having_been_brought_safely_through from the sea, justice not allowed \add ~him\add* to_be_living.
\v 5 Therefore indeed he, having_shaken_off the wild_beast into the fire, suffered not_one harm.
\v 6 But they were_expecting him to_be_going to_be_being_swelled_up, or to_be_falling_down suddenly dead. But over much \add time\add*, them waiting and observing nothing amiss becoming to him, having_changed_their_minds they_were_saying him to_be \add +a_\add*god.
\v 7 And in the \add parts\add* about that place, was_being properties to_the leader of_the island by_\add +the_\add*name Publius, who having_accepted us hospitably lodged three days.
\v 8 And it_became, the father of_Publius to_be_lying_down being_gripped_with with_fevers and dysentery, to whom Paulos having_come_in, and having_prayed, having_laid_on the hands on_him, he_healed him.
\v 9 And this having_become, also the rest in the island having sicknesses were_approaching and were_being_healed,
\v 10 who also they_honored us with_many honors, and being_launched, they_laid_on the \add >things\add* for our needs.
\v 11 And after three months, we_were_launched in \add +a_\add*ship having_wintered in the island, \add +an_\add*Alexandrian with_\add +a_\add*figurehead to_Zeus_twins.
\v 12 And having_been_set_down at Syracuse, we_remained_on three days,
\v 13 whence having_cut_away, we_arrived at Rhegium. And after one day, having_come_on \add +a_\add*south_wind, \add +the_\add*second \add day\add* we_came to Puteoli,
\v 14 where having_found \add +the_\add*brothers, we_were_implored by them to_remain_on seven days. And thus we_came to Ɽōmē.
\v 15 And_from_there the brothers having_heard, the \add >things\add* concerning us, came to meeting with_us until Appius Markoset and Three Taverns, whom Paulos having_seen, having_giving_thanks to_god, took courage.
\v 16 And when we_came_in to Ɽōmē, it_was_permitted to_Paulos to_be_remaining by himself, with the soldier guarding him.
\v 17 And it_became after three days, him to_call_together the \add >ones\add* being leaders of_the Jews. And them having_come_together, he_was_saying to them: Men brothers I, having_done nothing contrary to_the people or the ancestral customs, \add +a_\add*prisoner from Hierousalēm/(Yərūshālam) was_given_over into the hands of_the Romans,
\v 18 who having_examined me, were_wishing to_send_away \add me\add*, because_of that not_one cause of_death to_be_being in me.
\v 19 But speaking_against of_the Jews, I_was_compelled to_appeal to_Kaisar, not as having anything to_be_accusing against_the nation of_me.
\v 20 Therefore for this cause, I_begged you_all, to_see and to_address, for on_account of_the hope of_Israēl/(Yisərā'ēl), this chain I_am_being_encompassed \add in\add*.
\v 21 And they said to him: We neither received letters concerning you from Youdaia, nor having_arrived anyone of_the brothers reported or spoke anything evil concerning you.
\v 22 But we_are_considering_worthy to_hear from you what you_are_thinking, for indeed concerning this sect it_is known to_us, that it_is_being_spoken_against everywhere.
\v 23 And having_determined \add +a_\add*day for_him, more they_came to him to the lodging, to_whom he_was_explaining, testifying the kingdom of_god, and persuading them concerning Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a), from both the law of_Mōsēs/(Mosheh), and the prophets, from in_the_morning to evening.
\v 24 And on_one_hand the \add >ones\add* were_being_persuaded by_the \add >things\add* being_spoken, on_the_other_hand the \add >ones\add* were_disbelieving.
\v 25 And being discordant with one_another, they_were_sending_away, Paulos having_spoken one \add final\add* word: Rightly the holy spirit spoke by Ēsaias/(Yəsha'əyāh) the prophet to the fathers of_you_all
\v 26 saying: be_gone to this people, and say: ˱In˲_hearing you_all_will_be_hearing, and by_no_means you_all_may_ not _understand, and seeing you_all_will_be_seeing, and by_no_means you_all_may_ not _perceive.
\v 27 For the heart of_ this _people was_become_dull, and they_ hardly _heard with_their ears of_them, and they_shut the eyes of_them, lest they_may_see with_their eyes, and they_may_hear with_their ears, and they_may_understand with_their heart, and they_may_turn_back, and I_will_be_healing them.
\v 28 Therefore it_let_be known, to_you_all that this salvation of_god was_sent_out to_the pagans, and they will_be_hearing. 
\v 29
\v 30 And He_remained_in two_ whole _years in \add ^his_\add*own rental, and was_welcoming all the \add >ones\add* entering_in to him,
\v 31 proclaiming the kingdom of_god, and unhinderedly teaching the \add >things\add* concerning the master Yēsous messiah, with all boldness.
