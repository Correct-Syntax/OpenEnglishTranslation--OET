\v 1 Indeed the first account I_made concerning all \add >things\add*, Rx-Oh-Rx G‹Theofilos›G, of_which \nd G‹H‹Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a)›H›G\nd* began both to_be_doing and to_be_teaching,
\v 2 until which day having_commanded by \add +the\add*_ holy _\nd spirit\nd* to_the ambassadors, whom he_chose, he_was_taken_up, 
\v 3 to_whom also after the \add time\add* him to_suffer he_presented himself living, with many proofs through forty days, appearing to_them, and speaking the \add >things\add* concerning the kingdom of_\nd god\nd*.
\v 4 And assembling_together, he_commanded to_them: From G‹H‹Hierousalēm/(Yərūshālam)›H›G not to_be_being_departed, but to_be_awaiting the promise of_the father, which you_all_heard from_me.
\v 5 Because G‹Yōannēs›G on_one_hand immersed with_water, on_the_other_hand you_all will_be_being_immersed with \add +the\add*_ holy _\nd spirit\nd*, after many not these days.
\v 6 Therefore indeed the \add >ones\add* having_come_together, were_asking him saying: \nd master\nd*, at this time, are_you_restoring the kingdom to_Rx-G‹H‹Israēl/(Yisərā'ēl)›H›G-Rx. 
\v 7 And he_said to them: It_is not of_you_all to_know times or seasons, which the father set by his own authority.
\v 8 But you_all_will_be_receiving power, having_ The holy \nd spirit\nd* _come_over on you_all, and you_all_will_be witnesses for_me, in both G‹H‹Hierousalēm, and in all Rx-G‹Youdaia›G-Rx, and G‹H‹Samareia/(Shomərōn)›H›G, and to \add +the\add*_last \add part\add* of_the earth.
\v 9 And having_said these \add >things\add*, seeing them, he_was_lifted_up and \add +a\add*_cloud took_ him _up from the eyes of_them.
\v 10 And as they_were looking_intently into the sky, him going, also see two men in white clothing, had_stood_by to_them,
\v 11 who also said: Men, G‹Galilaios›G, why you_all_have_stood looking at the sky. This \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* having_been_taken_up from you_all into heaven, thus will_be_coming which manner you_all_saw him going into heaven.
\v 12 Then they_returned to G‹H‹Hierousalēm from \add +the\add*_mountain being_called of_Olivet, which is near G‹H‹Hierousalēm, having journey of_\add +a\add*_sabbath.
\v 13 And when they_came_in, into the upper_room, they_went_up where they_were staying, jointly G‹Petros›G and G‹Yōannēs›G and G‹H‹Yakōbos/(Ya'aqov)›H›G and G‹Andreas›G, Rx-G‹Filippos›G-Rx and G‹Thōmas›G, G‹Bartholomaios›G and G‹Matthaios›G, G‹H‹Yakōbos of_G‹Alfaios›G, and Rx-G‹Simōn›G-Rx the G‹Farisaios_zēlōtēs_\add group_member\add*›G, and G‹H‹Youdas/(Yəhūdāh)›H›G of_G‹H‹Yakōbos.
\v 14 These all were persevering in_prayer with_one_accord, with \add +the\add*_women and G‹H‹Maria/(Mirəyām)›H›G the mother of_\nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd*, and the brothers of_him.
\v 15 And in these days, G‹Petros›G having_stood_up in \add +the\add*_midst of_the brothers said (and \add +the\add*_crowd of_names with the same was about \add +a\add*_hundred twenty),
\v 16 Men, brothers, it_was_fitting the scripture to_be_fulfilled, which the holy \nd spirit\nd* previously_said by \add +the\add*_mouth of_G‹H‹Dauid/(Dāvid)›H›G concerning G‹H‹Youdas, the \add >one\add* having_become guide to_the \add >ones\add* having_captured \nd G‹H‹Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a)›H›G\nd*.
\v 17 Because he_was having_been_numbered with us, and obtained \add +a\add*_lot of_ this _service.
\v 18 (Therefore indeed this \add man\add* acquired \add +a\add*_field out_of \add +the\add*_reward of_unrighteousness, and having_become headlong, he_burst_open in_\add +the\add*_middle, and all the intestines of_him was_poured_out.
\v 19 And it_became known to_all the \add >ones\add* dwelling_in G‹H‹Hierousalēm/(Yərūshālam)›H›G, so_that that field to_be_called in_their language of_them, G‹Akeldama›G, this is: field of_blood.)
\v 20 For it_has_been_written in scroll of_psalms, the \add +the\add*_homestead of_him let_be_become desolate, and let_ not _be the \add >one\add* dwelling in it, and: let_ another _take the overseeing of_him.
\v 21 Therefore it_is_fitting of_the men having_come_together with_us, at all \add +the\add*_time that the \nd master\nd* \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* came_in and came_out with us,
\v 22 having_begun from the immersion of_G‹Yōannēs›G until the day in_which he_was_taken_up from us, \add +a\add*_witness of_the resurrection of_him with us, to_become one of_these.
\v 23 And they_set two, G‹H‹Yōsēf/(Yōşēf)›H›G being_called G‹Barsabbas›G, who was_called G‹Youstos›G, and G‹Matthias›G.
\v 24 And having_prayed, they_said: You \nd master\nd*, heart_knower of_all, reveal which one you_chose of these two,
\v 25 to_take the this place of_service and commission, from which G‹H‹Youdas broke_from, to_be_gone to his own place.
\v 26 And they_gave lots to_them, and the lot fell on G‹Matthias›G, and he_was_chosen_together_with with the eleven ambassadors.
\c 2
\v 1 And at the \add time\add* the day of_pentecost to_be_being_fulfilled, they_were all together in the same \add place\add*.
\v 2 And suddenly \add +a\add*_sound became out_of heaven, as being_carried of_\add +a\add*_ forceful _wind, and it_filled all the house where they_were sitting.
\v 3 And dividing tongues as_if of_fire were_seen to_them, and sat_down on each one of_them.
\v 4 And they_were_ all _filled with_\add +the\add*_ holy _\nd spirit\nd*, and they_began to_be_speaking with_other tongues, as the \nd spirit\nd* was_giving to_them to_be_speaking_out.
\v 5 And G‹Youdaiōns›G were dwelling in G‹H‹Hierousalēm, devout men from every nation of_the \add nations\add* under heaven.
\v 6 And of_ this _sound having_become, the multitude came_together and was_confounded, because each one heard speaking of_them in_his. own language.
\v 7 And they_were_amazed and they_were_Rx-marvelling-Rx saying: Behold are not, all these who \add =are\add* speaking G‹Galilaios›G. 
\v 8 And how are_ we _hearing each in_the own language of_us, in which we_were_born. 
\v 9 G‹\add >ones\add*_from_Parthia›G, and G‹\add >ones\add*_from_Mēdia›G, and G‹\add >ones\add*_from_Elam›G, and the \add >ones\add* dwelling_in G‹Mesopotamia›G, Rx-G‹Youdaia›G-Rx and jointly G‹Kappadokia›G, Rx-G‹Pontos›G-Rx and G‹Asia›G,
\v 10 G‹Frugia›G and jointly G‹Pamfulia›G, G‹H‹Aiguptos/(Miʦərayim)›H›G, and the parts of_G‹Libuē›G along G‹Kurēnē›G, and the \add >ones\add* G‹Ɽōmaios›G visiting,
\v 11 both G‹Youdaiōns›G and converts, G‹\add >ones\add*_from_Krētē›G and G‹\add >ones\add*_from_G‹Arabia›G›G, we_are_hearing them speaking, the great \add >things\add* of_\nd god\nd* in_our tongues.
\v 12 And all were_Rx-marvelling-Rx and were_thoroughly_perplexed, another saying to another: What is_wanting this to_be. 
\v 13 But others mocking were_saying, They_are having_been_filled of_sweet_wine.
\v 14 But G‹Petros›G having_been_stood with the eleven, lifted_up the voice of_him and spoke_out to_them: Men, G‹\add >ones\add*_from_Youdaia›G, and all you_all dwelling_in G‹H‹Hierousalēm/(Yərūshālam)›H›G, let_ this _be known to_you_all and give_ear to_the words of_me.
\v 15 For these are_ not _being_drunk as you_all are_supposing, for it_is \add +the\add*_ third _hour, of_the day,
\v 16 but this is the \add word\add* having_been_spoken by the prophet G‹H‹Yōēl/(Yō'ēl)›H›G:
\v 17 and it_will_be with these \add >things\add* in the last days, \nd god\nd* is_saying: I_will_be_pouring_out of the \nd spirit\nd* of_me on all flesh, and the sons of_you_all will_be_prophesying, and the daughters of_you_all, and the young_men of_you_all will_be_seeing visions, and the elders of_you_all in_dreams will_be_being_dreamt, 
\v 18 and surely I_will_be_pouring_out of the \nd spirit\nd* of_me on the slaves of_me, and on the handmaidens of_me, in those days, and they_will_be_prophesying.
\v 19 And I_will_be_giving wonders in the sky above, and signs on the earth below, blood, and fire, and vapor of_smoke.
\v 20 The sun will_be_being_altered into darkness and the moon into blood, before \add +the\add*_ great and glorious _day of_\add +the\add*_\nd master\nd* to_come.
\v 21 And it_will_be, everyone who may_call on_the name of_\add +the\add*_\nd master\nd* will_be_being_saved.
\v 22 Men, G‹H‹\add >ones\add*_from_Israēl/(Yisərā'ēl)›H›G, hear words these: \nd G‹H‹Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a)›H›G\nd* the G‹from_Nazaret›G, \add +a\add*_man having_been_demonstrated by \nd god\nd* to you_all by_miracles, and wonders, and signs, which \nd god\nd* did by him in \add +the\add*_midst of_you_all, as you_all_ yourselves _have_known.
\v 23 This \add man\add* by_the, having_been_designated counsel and foreknowledge of_\nd god\nd*, delivered_up by \add +the\add*_hand of_\add +the\add*_lawless \add >ones\add*, you_all_killed having_impaled_on_a_stake.
\v 24 Whom \nd god\nd* raised_up, having_untied/released the agonies of_the death, as_much_as was not possible him to_be_being_restrained by it.
\v 25 For G‹H‹Dauid/(Dāvid)›H›G is_saying to him: I_was_foreseeing the \nd master\nd* before me through all \add time\add*, because he_is on \add +the\add*_right \add hand\add* of_me, in_order_that I _may_ not _be_shaken.
\v 26 Because_of this the heart of_me was_gladdened, and the tongue of_me exulted, and still also the flesh of_me will_be_nesting in hope, 
\v 27 because you will_ not _be_abandoning the soul of_me into G‹Hadēs›G, nor will_you_be_giving the devout \add Rx-one-Rx\add* of_you to_see decay.
\v 28 You_made_known to_me \add +the\add*_ways of_life, you_will_be_filling me with_gladness with the presence of_you.
\v 29 Men, brothers, it_is_permitting to_speak with confidence to you_all concerning the patriarch G‹H‹Dauid that he_ both _died and was_buried, and the tomb of_him is among us until this day.
\v 30 Therefore being \add +a\add*_prophet, and having_known that \nd god\nd* swore to_him with_\add +an\add*_oath: of \add +the\add*_fruit of_the loin of_him, to_sit_down on the throne of_him.
\v 31 Having_foreseen, he_spoke concerning the resurrection of_the \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd* that neither was_abandoned into G‹Hadēs›G, nor the flesh of_him saw decay.
\v 32 This \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* \nd god\nd* raised_up, of_which all we are witnesses.
\v 33 Therefore having_been_exalted by_the right \add hand\add* of_\nd god\nd*, and having_received the promise of_the holy \nd spirit\nd*, from the father, he_poured_ this _out which you_all are_seeing and are_hearing.
\v 34 For G‹H‹Dauid not went_up into the heavens, but himself is_saying, \add +the\add*_\nd master\nd* said to_the \nd master\nd* of_me: Be_sitting on \add +the\add*_right \add hand\add* of_me,
\v 35 until I_may_put the enemies of_you \add +a\add*_footstool of_the feet of_you.
\v 36 Assuredly therefore let_ All \add +the\add*_house of_Rx-G‹H‹Israēl/(Yisərā'ēl)›H›G-Rx _be_knowing that \nd god\nd* made him both \add +the\add*_\nd master\nd* and \add +the\add*_\nd chosen_one\nd*, this \nd G‹H‹Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a)›H›G\nd* whom you_all impaled_on_a_stake.
\v 37 And having_heard, they_were_pierced to_the heart, and they_said to G‹Petros›G and the other ambassadors: What may_we_do, men, brothers. 
\v 38 And G‹Petros›G is_saying to them: Repent: and let_ each of_you_all _be_immersed in the name of_\nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* \nd chosen_one\nd*, for forgiveness of_the sins of_you_all, and you_all_will_be_receiving the gift of_the holy \nd spirit\nd*.
\v 39 For the promise is to_you_all, and to_the children of_you_all, and to_all the \add >ones\add* at far, as_many_as may_call_to \add +the\add*_\nd master\nd*, the \nd god\nd* of_us.
\v 40 Both with_ more _other words he_testified, and was_exhorting them saying: Be_saved from this crooked generation.
\v 41 Therefore indeed the \add >ones\add* having_welcomed the word of_him were_immersed, and were_added on that day, about three_thousand souls.
\v 42 And they_were persevering in_the teaching of_the ambassadors, and in_fellowship, the breaking of_the bread, and in_prayers.
\v 43 And reverence was_becoming on_every soul, and many wonders and signs was_becoming through the ambassadors. in G‹H‹Hierousalēm/(Yərūshālam)›H›G. and great fear was with all.
\v 44 and And all the \add >ones\add* having_believed were with the same \add purpose\add*, and they_were_having all common \add >things\add*,
\v 45 and they_were_selling their properties and their possessions, and they_were_dividing them to_all, anyone was_having as_much_as would need.
\v 46 And in_every day persevering with_one_accord in the temple, and breaking bread in_every house, they_were_partaking of_food with exultation and simplicity of_heart,
\v 47 praising \nd god\nd* and having favour with all the people. And the \nd master\nd* was_adding the \add >ones\add* being_saved with the same. in_every day.
\c 3
\v 1 And G‹Petros›G also G‹Yōannēs›G were_going_up into the temple at the hour of_prayer the ninth \add hour\add*.
\v 2 And \add +a\add*_certain man, being lame from \add +the\add*_womb of_\add +the\add*_mother of_him, was_being_born, whom they_were_putting in_every day at the door of_the temple, being_called Beautiful, to_be_requesting alms from the \add >ones\add* entering_in into the temple.
\v 3 Who having_seen G‹Petros›G and G‹Yōannēs›G going to_be_entering into the temple, was_asking to_receive alms.
\v 4 But G‹Petros›G having_looked_intently at him with G‹Yōannēs›G said: Look to us.
\v 5 And he was_holding_on to_them, expecting to_receive something from them.
\v 6 But G‹Petros›G said: Silver and gold is_ not _being to_me, but this what I_am_having, I_am_giving to_you, in the name of_\nd G‹H‹Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a)›H›G\nd* \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd* of_the G‹from_Nazaret›G, be_walking. 
\v 7 And having_grabbed him by_the right hand, he_raised him, and immediately the feet of_him and the ankles were_strengthened.
\v 8 And leaping_up, he_stood and was_walking, and came_in with them into the temple, walking, and springing_up, and praising \nd god\nd*.
\v 9 And all the people saw him walking and praising the \nd god\nd*.
\v 10 And they_were_recognizing him that he was the \add >one\add* sitting at the Beautiful gate of_the temple for the alms, and they_were_filled with_amazement and amazement at the \add >thing\add* having_been_happened to_him.
\v 11 And of_him taking_hold_of G‹Petros›G and G‹Yōannēs›G, all the people ran_together to them in the portico being_called of_G‹H‹Solomōn/(Shəlmoh)›H›G, greatly_amazed.
\v 12 But G‹Petros›G having_seen \add it\add*, answered to the people: Men, G‹H‹\add >ones\add*_from_Israēl/(Yisərā'ēl)›H›G, why you_all_are_wondering at this, or why you_all_are_looking_intently at_us, as_though by_\add ^our\add*_own power or devoutness having_made him to_be_walking. 
\v 13 The \nd god\nd* of_G‹H‹Abra'am/('Avərāhām)›H›G, and the \add +the\add*_\nd god\nd* of_G‹H‹Isa'ak/(Yiʦəḩāq)›H›G, and the \add +the\add*_\nd god\nd* of_G‹H‹Yakōb/(Ya'aqov)›H›G, the \nd god\nd* of_the fathers of_us, glorified the servant of_him, \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd*, whom you_all indeed gave_over, and disowned in \add +the\add*_presence of_Rx-G‹Pilatos›G-Rx, that \add >one\add* having_judged to_be_sending_away \add ~him\add*.
\v 14 But you_all disowned the holy \add Rx-one-Rx\add* and righteous \add Rx-one-Rx\add*, and you_all_requested \add +a\add*_man \add +a\add*_murderer to_be_granted to_you_all,
\v 15 but you_all_killed_off the originator of_life, whom \nd god\nd* raised from \add +the\add*_dead, of_which we are witnesses.
\v 16 And faith in_the name of_him, this \add man\add* whom you_all_are_observing and you_all_have_known, strengthened the name of_him, and the faith which \add =is\add* by him, gave complete_healing to_him this in_front_of all of_you_all.
\v 17 And now, brothers, I_have_known that you_all_did in ignorance, as also the rulers of_you_all.
\v 18 But what \add >things\add* \nd god\nd* foretold by \add +the\add*_mouth of_all the prophets, the \nd chosen_one\nd* of_him to_suffer, he_fulfilled thus.
\v 19 Therefore repent and turn_back, for the \add time\add* of_you_all sins to_be_wiped_out,
\v 20 so_that times of_refreshment may_come from \add +the\add*_presence of_the \nd master\nd*, and he_may_send_out the \add >one\add* having_been_appointed to_you_all \add +the\add*_\nd chosen_one\nd* \nd G‹H‹Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a)›H›G\nd*,
\v 21 whom indeed it_is_fitting heaven to_receive, until \add +the\add*_times of_restoration of_all \add >things\add*, which \nd god\nd* spoke from \add +the\add*_age by \add +the\add*_mouth of_the holy prophets of_him.
\v 22 Indeed G‹H‹Mōsēs/(Mosheh)›H›G said, \add +the\add*_\nd master\nd*, the \nd god\nd* of_us will_be_raising_up \add +a\add*_prophet to_you_all like of_you_all me from the brothers, you_all_will_be_hearing from_him in all \add >things\add*, as_many_as he_may_speak to you_all.
\v 23 And it_will_be \add that\add* every soul, whoever may_ not _hear from_ that _prophet, will_be_being_wholly_destroyed from the people.
\v 24 And also all the prophets from G‹H‹Samouēl/(Shəmū'ēl)›H›G and the \add >ones\add* consecutively, as_many_as spoke, also proclaimed these days.
\v 25 You_all are the sons of_the prophets, and of_the covenant which \nd god\nd* covenanted with the fathers of_you_all, saying to G‹H‹Abra'am: and in the seed of_you all the families of_the earth will_be_being_blessed.
\v 26 \nd god\nd* having_raised_up the servant of_him, sent_ him _out To_you_all first, blessing you_all in that to_be_turning_away each from the wickedness of_you_all.
\c 4
\v 1 And of_them speaking to the people, the chief_priests, and the officer of_the temple, and the G‹Saddoukaios_\add sect\add*›G approached to_them,
\v 2 being_thoroughly_disturbing because_of the \add >thing\add* them to_be_teaching to_the people, and to_be_proclaiming the resurrection in \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd*, which \add =is\add* from \add +the\add*_dead.
\v 3 And they_laid_ their _on on_them hands, and they_put \add them\add* in jail to the_ next _\add day\add*, for it_was already evening.
\v 4 But many the \add >ones\add* having_heard the word, believed and number of_the men was_become about five thousands.
\v 5 And it_became on the_ next _\add day\add* the rulers of_them, and the elders, and the scribes to_be_gathered_together in G‹H‹Hierousalēm/(Yərūshālam)›H›G,
\v 6 and G‹Annas›G the chief_priest, and G‹Kaiafas›G, and G‹Yōannēs›G, and G‹Alexandros›G, and as_many_as were of chief_priestly descent.
\v 7 And having_stood them in the midst, they_were_inquiring: In what power or in what name you_all did this. 
\v 8 Then G‹Petros›G having_been_filled with_\add +the\add*_ holy _\nd spirit\nd*, said to them: Rulers of_the people and elders,
\v 9 if we today are_being_examined on \add +a\add*_good_work to_\add +the\add*_ sick _man, by what this \add >one\add* has_been_healed,
\v 10 it_let_be known to_all you_all and to_all the people of_Rx-G‹H‹Israēl/(Yisərā'ēl)›H›G-Rx, that in the name of_\nd G‹H‹Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a)›H›G\nd* \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd* the G‹from_Nazaret›G, whom you_all impaled_on_a_stake, whom \nd god\nd* raised from \add +the\add*_dead, by this \add name\add* this \add man\add* has_stood_by before you_all healthy.
\v 11 This \add >one\add* is the stone having_been_scorned by you_all, the builders, which having_become to \add +the\add*_head of_\add +the\add*_corner.
\v 12 And not_one the is not in other salvation, for there_is not another name under heaven having_been_given among people, by which it_is_fitting us to_be_saved.
\v 13 And observing the boldness of_G‹Petros›G and of_G‹Yōannēs›G, and having_grasped that they_are illiterate and ordinary men, they_were_Rx-marvelling-Rx, and they_were_recognizing them that they_were with \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd*.
\v 14 And seeing the man having_stood with them, the \add >one\add* having_been_healed, they_were_having nothing to_speak_against \add them\add*.
\v 15 But having_commanded them to_go_away outside the council, they_were_conferring with one_another
\v 16 saying: What we_may_do to_ these _men. For indeed that has_become \add +a\add*_known sign through them, to_all the \add >ones\add* dwelling_in G‹H‹Hierousalēm \add =is\add* manifest, and we_are_ not _being_able to_be_disowning \add it\add*.
\v 17 But in_order_that may_ not _be_spread on more among the people, we_may_threaten to_them to_ no_longer _be_speaking in this name to_no_one of_\add +the\add*_people.
\v 18 And having_called them, they_commanded \add them\add* not to_be_speaking nor to_be_teaching in the name of_\nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* at_all.
\v 19 But G‹Petros›G and G‹Yōannēs›G answering said to them: Judge whether it_is right before \nd god\nd*, to_be_hearing from_you_all rather than from_\nd god\nd*.
\v 20 For we are_ not _being_able to_be_ not _speaking what we_saw and we_heard.
\v 21 And they having_further_threatened \add them\add* sent_ them _away, finding nothing how they_may_punish them, because_of the people, because all were_glorifying \nd god\nd* for the \add >thing\add* having_become.
\v 22 For the man on whom this sign of_the healing had_become was more years \add =than\add* forty.
\v 23 And having_been_sent_away, they_came to their own, and they_reported as_much_as the chief_priests and the elders said to them.
\v 24 And which having_heard, with_one_accord lifted_up \add ^their\add*_voice to \nd god\nd* and said: Master, you having_made the heaven, and the earth, and the sea, and all the \add >things\add* in them,
\v 25 the \add >one\add* of_the father of_us, by \add +the\add*_ holy _\nd spirit\nd* of_\add +the\add*_mouth G‹H‹Dauid/(Dāvid)›H›G servant of_you having_said: for_ why _reason \add +the\add*_pagans raged, and peoples pondered new \add >things\add*. 
\v 26 Standing_before the kings of_the earth and the rulers were_gathered_together with themselves against the \nd master\nd*, and against the \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd* of_him.
\v 27 For both Rx-G‹Hērōdēs›G-Rx and G‹Pontios›G Rx-G‹Pilatos›G-Rx were_gathered_together in truth in this city with \add +the\add*_pagans and peoples of_Rx-G‹H‹Israēl/(Yisərā'ēl)›H›G-Rx against the holy servant of_you \nd G‹H‹Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a)›H›G\nd*, whom you_anointed,

\v 29 And the \add >things\add* now, \nd master\nd*, look_upon on the threats of_them, and give to_the slaves of_you, all to_be_speaking the of_you word with boldness,

\v 31 And having_been_besought of_them, the place in which they_were having_been_gathered_together was_shaken, and all were_filled the holy \nd spirit\nd*, and they_were_speaking the word of_\nd god\nd* with boldness.
\v 32 And the multitude of_the \add >ones\add* having_believed, was one in_heart and soul, and not_even one anything of_the \add >things\add* possessing to_him was_saying to_be \add ^his\add*_own, but was all \add >things\add* in_common to_them.
\v 33 And with_ great _power, the ambassadors of_the \nd master\nd* \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* were_giving_back , testimony, of_the resurrection, and great grace was on them all.
\v 34 For not_even any impoverished was among them, for as_many_as were_being owners of_properties or houses, selling \add them\add* they_were_bringing the values of_the \add >things\add* being_sold,
\v 35 and they_were_laying \add them\add* before the feet of_the ambassadors, and it_was_being_distributed to_each, as_much_as anyone was_having need.
\v 36 And G‹H‹Yōsēf/(Yōşēf)›H›G the \add >one\add* having_been_called G‹Barnabas›G, by the ambassadors, which is being_translated: son of_exhortation, \add +a\add*_G‹H‹Leuitēs/(from_tribe_of_Lēvī)›H›G, \add +a\add*_G‹from_Kupros›G by_descent,

\v 1 But \add +a\add*_certain man by_\add +the\add*_name Rx-G‹Ananias›G-Rx, with G‹Sapfeirē›G the wife of_him, sold \add +a\add*_property

\v 3 But G‹Petros›G said: Rx-G‹Ananias›G-Rx, for_ Why _reason G‹H‹Satan/(Sāţān)›H›G filled the heart of_you, for_you to_lie to_the holy \nd spirit\nd*, and to_embezzle from the value of_the property. 
\v 4 Not remaining \add unsold\add* it_was_remaining to_you, and having_been_sold it_was_being in your authority. Why that you_purposed in the heart of_you this matter. You_lied not to_people, but to_\nd god\nd*.
\v 5 And Rx-G‹Ananias›G-Rx hearing these words, having_fallen he_stopped_breathing. And great fear became on all the \add >ones\add* hearing.
\v 6 And having_risen_up, the younger \add men\add* covered him, and having_brought_out \add ~him\add*, they_buried \add ~him\add*.
\v 7 And it_became \add +a\add*_period about three hours, and the wife of_him, not having_known the \add >thing\add* having_become, came_in.
\v 8 And G‹Petros›G answered to her: Tell to_me if for_so_much the property and. you_all_gave_back she said: Yes, for_so_much.
\v 9 But G‹Petros›G \add said\add* to her: Why \add is_it\add* that it_was_agreed_together by_you_all to_test the \nd spirit\nd* of_\add +the\add*_\nd master\nd*. See the feet of_the \add >ones\add* having_buried the husband of_you \add =are\add* at the door, and they_will_be_bringing_ you _out.
\v 10 And immediately she_fell before the feet of_him, and stopped_breathing. And having_come_in, the young_men found her dead, and having_brought_out \add her\add*, they_buried \add her\add* with the husband of_her.
\v 11 And great reverence became on all the assembly, and on all the \add >ones\add* hearing these \add >things\add*.
\v 12 And by the hands of_the ambassadors, many signs and wonders was_becoming, among the people, and all were with_one_accord in the Veranda of_G‹H‹Solomōn/(Shəlmoh)›H›G.
\v 13 But of_the rest no_one was_daring to_be_being_joined_together to_them, but the people was_magnifying them,
\v 14 and more believing \add >ones\add* were_being_added in_the \nd master\nd*, multitudes of_ both _men and women, 
\v 15 so_as even to_be_bringing_out the sick on the roads, and to_be_putting \add them\add* on cots and pallets, in_order_that coming of_G‹Petros›G, even_if the shadow may_overshadow on_someone of_them.
\v 16 And the multitude was_coming_together also from_the surrounding \add +the\add*_cities of_G‹H‹Hierousalēm/(Yərūshālam)›H›G, bringing \add +the\add*_sick and being_being_tormented \add >ones\add* by unclean spirits, who /were_ all _being_healed.
\v 17 But the chief_priest and all the \add >ones\add* with him, being the sect of_the G‹Saddoukaios_\add sect\add*›G having_risen_up, were_filled with_jealousy,
\v 18 and they_laid_on their hands on the ambassadors, and they_put them in public jail.
\v 19 But \add +an\add*_angel of_\add +the\add*_\nd master\nd* opened_up the doors of_the prison through, \add +the\add*_night, and having_led_ them _out said,
\v 20 Be_going, and having_been_stood, in the temple be_speaking to_the people all the words of_ this _life.
\v 21 And having_heard, they_came_in by dawn into the temple, and they_were_teaching. And having_arrived the chief_priest and the \add >ones\add* with him, they_called_together the council and all the council of_the sons of_Rx-G‹H‹Israēl/(Yisərā'ēl)›H›G-Rx, and they_sent_out to the prison for_them to_be_brought.
\v 22 But they having_arrived attendants, not found them in the prison, and having_returned, they_reported
\v 23 saying, We_found the \add +the\add*_prison having_been_shut with all security, and the guards having_stood before the doors, but having_opened_up, we_found no_one inside.
\v 24 And when they_heard these words, both the officer of_the temple and the chief_priests were_thoroughly_perplexing concerning them, what this might_become.
\v 25 But having_arrived, someone reported to_them, See the men whom you_all_put in the prison are in the temple, having_stood and teaching the people. 
\v 26 Then having_gone_away, the officer with the attendants was_bringing them, not with force, for they_were_fearing the people, lest they_may_be_stoned.
\v 27 And having_brought them, they_set \add them\add* in the council. And the chief_priest asked them
\v 28 saying, we_commanded to_you_all ˱By˲_\add +a\add*_charge not to_be_teaching in this name, and see, you_all_have_filled G‹H‹Hierousalēm with_the teaching of_you_all, and you_all_are_wishing to_bring_upon on us the blood of_ this _man.
\v 29 But G‹Petros›G and the ambassadors answering said: To_be_yielding it_is_fitting to_\nd god\nd*, rather than people.
\v 30 The \nd god\nd* of_the fathers of_us raised \nd G‹H‹Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a)›H›G\nd*, whom you_all handed_over, having_hanged \add ~him\add* on \add +a\add*_cross.
\v 31 \nd god\nd* exalted This \add >one\add* originator and Rx-saviour-Rx, by_the right \add hand\add* of_him, to_give repentance to_Rx-G‹H‹Israēl/(Yisərā'ēl)›H›G-Rx and forgiveness of_sins.
\v 32 And we are witnesses of_ these _words, and the holy \nd spirit\nd*, whom \nd god\nd* gave to_the \add >ones\add* yielding to_him.
\v 33 And they having_heard were_being_cut_through, and they_were_wishing to_kill them.
\v 34 But \add +a\add*_certain G‹Farisaios_\add sect_member\add*›G by_\add +the\add*_name G‹H‹Gamaliēl/(Gaməlī'ēl)›H›G having_risen_up in the council, \add +a\add*_law_teacher honored by_all the people, he_commanded \add them\add* to_make the men. outside \add +a\add*_little \add time\add*.
\v 35 And he_said to them: Men, G‹H‹\add >ones\add*_from_Israēl/(Yisərā'ēl)›H›G, be_taking_heed to_yourselves what you_all_are_going to_be_doing with these men.
\v 36 For before these days G‹Theudas›G rose_up, saying himself to_be someone, to_whom was_joined_up of_men \add +a\add*_number of_ about _four_hundred, who was_killed and all as_many_as were_being_persuaded by_him were_dispersed and became to nothing.
\v 37 After this, G‹H‹Youdas/(Yəhūdāh)›H›G the Rx-G‹Galilaios›G-Rx rose_up in the days of_the registration, and drew_away people after him, and_that \add >one\add* perished, and all as_many_as were_being_persuaded by_him were_scattered.
\v 38 And now I_am_saying the \add >things\add* to_you_all, withdraw from these men and allow them, because if this counsel or this work it_may_be from humans, will_be_being_torn_down,
\v 39 but if it_is from \nd god\nd*, you_all will_ not _be_able to_tear_down them, lest also you_all_may_be_found god-opposers. And they_were_persuaded by_him,
\v 40 and having_called_to the ambassadors, having_beat they_commanded \add them\add* not to_be_speaking in the name of_\nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd*, and they_sent_away \add them\add*.
\v 41 Therefore they indeed were_going, rejoicing from \add +the\add*_presence of_the council that they_were_considered_worthy to_be_dishonored for his name.
\v 42 And every day in the temple and in /each/_house, they_were_ not _ceasing teaching and gospel_preaching the \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd*, \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd*.
\c 6
\v 1 And in these days multiplying the apprentices/followers, became \add +a\add*_grumbling of_the G‹Hellēnistēs›G against the G‹Hebraios›G, because the widows of_them were_being_overlooked in the daily service.
\v 2 And the twelve having_called_to the multitude of_the apprentices/followers said: It_is not pleasing us, having_left the word of_\nd god\nd*, to_be_serving unto_tables.
\v 3 but brothers examine, men from of_you_all being_attested, seven full of_\add +the\add*_\nd spirit\nd* and wisdom, whom we_will_be_appointing over this need.
\v 4 But we will_be_persevering in_prayer and service of_the word.
\v 5 And the statement brought_pleasure before all the multitude, and they_chose G‹Stefanos›G, \add +a\add*_man full of_faith and of_\add +the\add*_ holy _\nd spirit\nd*, and Rx-G‹Filippos›G-Rx, and G‹Proⱪoros›G, and G‹Nikanōr›G, and G‹Timōn›G, and G‹Parmenas›G, and G‹Nikolaos›G \add +a\add*_ G‹from_Antioⱪeia›G _convert,
\v 6 whom they_stood before the ambassadors, and having_prayed, they_laid_on their hands on_them.
\v 7 And the word of_the of_\nd god\nd* was_growing, and the number of_the apprentices/followers in G‹H‹Hierousalēm/(Yərūshālam)›H›G was_being_multiplied exceedingly, and \add +a\add*_great crowd of_the priests were_submitting in_the faith.
\v 8 And G‹Stefanos›G full of_grace and power, was_doing wonders and great signs among the people.
\v 9 But some of_the of the synagogue, being_called Freedmen, and of_G‹\add >ones\add*from_Kurēnē›G, and of_G‹from_Alexandria›Gs, and of_the \add >ones\add* from G‹Kilikia›G, and G‹Asia›G rose_up, debating with_the G‹Stefanos›G.
\v 10 And they_were_were_ not _able to_resist against_the wisdom and the \nd spirit\nd*, by_whom he_was_speaking.
\v 11 Then they_instigated men saying, We_have_heard him speaking slanderous words against G‹H‹Mōsēs/(Mosheh)›H›G and \nd god\nd*.
\v 12 And they_stirred_up the people, and the elders, and the scribes, and having_approached, they_seized him and brought \add ~him\add* to the council,
\v 13 and they_set false witnesses saying: this man is_ not _ceasing speaking words against this the holy place and the law,
\v 14 for we_have_heard him saying that this \nd G‹H‹Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a)›H›G\nd* the G‹from_Nazaret›G will_be_tearing_down this place, and will_be_changing the customs that G‹H‹Mōsēs gave_over to_us.
\v 15 And having_looked_intently at him, all the \add >ones\add* sitting in the council saw the face of_him, as_if \add +the\add*_face of_\add +an\add*_angel.
\c 7
\v 1 And the chief_priest said: these \add >things\add* is_having thus. 
\v 2 And he was_saying: Men, brothers and fathers, hear \add me\add*. The \nd god\nd* of_glory was_seen by_ G‹H‹Abra'am/('Avərāhām)›H›G _the father of_us, him being in G‹Mesopotamia›G before to_dwell in G‹H‹Ⱪarran/(Ḩārān)›H›G,
\v 3 and he_said to him: come_out from the land of_you and from the relatives of_you, and come into the land whichever I_will_be_showing to_you.
\v 4 Then having_come_out from \add +the\add*_land of_G‹H‹\add >ones\add*_from_Ⱪaldia/(Kasəddiy)›H›G, he_dwelt in G‹H‹Ⱪarran. And_from_there after the \add time\add* the father of_him to_die_off, he_removed him into this land, in which you_all are_ now _dwelling.
\v 5 And not gave to_him \add +an\add*_inheritance in it, nor \add +the\add*_tribunal of_\add +a\add*_foot, but he_promised to_give to_him for \add +a\add*_possession it, and to_the descendants of_him after him, not being to_him \add +a\add*_child.
\v 6 But \nd god\nd* spoke thus that will_be the descendants of_him: \add +a\add*_sojourner in another's land, and they_will_be_enslaving it and they_will_be_mistreating \add it\add* four_hundred years.
\v 7 But I \nd god\nd* will_be_judging the nation for_whichever they_may_serve, said: and after these \add >things\add*, they_will_be_coming_out and will_be_serving unto_me in this place.
\v 8 And he_gave to_him \add +the\add*_covenant of_circumcision, and thus he_bore G‹H‹Isa'ak/(Yiʦəḩāq)›H›G, and circumcised him on_the eighth day, and G‹H‹Isa'ak \add bore\add* G‹H‹Yakōb/(Ya'aqov)›H›G, and Twelve the G‹H‹Yakōb patriarchs.
\v 9 And the patriarchs having_been_jealous of_G‹H‹Yōsēf/(Yōşēf)›H›G, gave_back \add ~him\add* into G‹H‹Aiguptos/(Miʦərayim)›H›G, but \nd god\nd* was with him,
\v 10 and he_rescued him out_of all the tribulations of_him, and gave to_him favour and wisdom before G‹H‹Faraō/(Farə'oh)›H›G, king of_G‹H‹Aiguptos, and he_appointed him leading \add >one\add* over G‹H‹Aiguptos, and over all the house of_him.
\v 11 And \add +a\add*_famine came on all the G‹H‹Aiguptos and Rx-G‹H‹Ⱪana'an/(Kina'an)›H›G-Rx, and great tribulation, and the fathers of_us were_ not _finding food.
\v 12 But G‹H‹Yakōb having_heard, being grain in G‹H‹Aiguptos, sent_away the fathers of_us first.
\v 13 And on the second \add time\add*, G‹H‹Yōsēf was_made_known by_the brothers of_him, and the descent of_G‹H‹Yōsēf it_became manifest to_G‹H‹Faraō.
\v 14 And G‹H‹Yōsēf having_sent_out, summoned G‹H‹Yakōb, the father of_him, and all the relatives, in seventy five souls.
\v 15 And G‹H‹Yakōb came_down into G‹H‹Aiguptos, and he and the fathers of_us died,
\v 16 and they_were_replaced to G‹H‹Suⱪem/(Shəkem)›H›G, and they_were_put in the tomb, which G‹H‹Abra'am purchased for_\add +a\add*_value of_silver from the sons of_G‹H‹Emmor/(Ḩamōr)›H›G in G‹H‹Suⱪem.
\v 17 But as the time of_the promise, which \nd god\nd* promised to_G‹H‹Abra'am was_nearing, the people grew and was_multiplied in G‹H‹Aiguptos,
\v 18 until of_which another king rose_up over G‹H‹Aiguptos, who had_ not _known G‹H‹Yōsēf.
\v 19 He, having_taken_advantage of_the race of_us, mistreated the fathers to_be_making the babies of_them abandoned, in_order that to_ not _be_being_kept_alive.
\v 20 In that time G‹H‹Mōsēs/(Mosheh)›H›G was_born, and he_was beautiful to_\nd god\nd*, who was_brought_up three months in the house of_the father.
\v 21 And, having_been_set_out of_him the daughter of_G‹H‹Faraō took_ him _away, and brought_ him _up for_herself for \add +a\add*_son.
\v 22 And G‹H‹Mōsēs was_instructed in in_all \add +the\add*_wisdom of_\add +the\add*_G‹H‹from_Aiguptos/(Miʦərayim)›H›Gs, and was powerful in \add +the\add*_words and \add +the\add*_works of_him.
\v 23 But when \add +a\add*_ forty_year _time was_being_fulfilled to_him, went_up in the heart of_him to_visit the brothers of_him, the sons of_Rx-G‹H‹Israēl/(Yisərā'ēl)›H›G-Rx.
\v 24 And having_seen one being_wronged, he_retaliated and did vengeance for_the \add >one\add* being_distressed, having_struck the G‹H‹from_Aiguptos.
\v 25 And he_was_thinking the brothers to_be_understanding that \nd god\nd* by \add +the\add*_hand of_him is_giving salvation to_them, but they not understood.
\v 26 And on_the following day, he_was_seen to_them quarrelling, and he_was_reconciling them to peace, having_said: Men, you_all_are brothers. for_ Why _reason are_you_all_injuring one_another. 
\v 27 But the \add >one\add* injuring your neighbor pushed_ him _away having_said: who appointed you ruler and judge over us. 
\v 28 You are_ not _wanting to_kill me, which manner you_killed the G‹H‹from_Aiguptos yesterday. 
\v 29 And G‹H‹Mōsēs fled at this statement: and became \add +a\add*_sojourner in \add +the\add*_land of_G‹H‹Madiam/(Midəyān)›H›G, where he_bore two sons.
\v 30 And forty years having_been_fulfilled: \add +an\add*_angel was_seen to_him in the desert of_Mount G‹H‹Sina/(Şīnay)›H›G, in \add +a\add*_flame of_fire of_\add +a\add*_thorn_bush.
\v 31 And G‹H‹Mōsēs having_seen \add it\add*, Rx-marvelled-Rx at_the vision. And him approaching to_observe \add it\add*, there_became \add +the\add*_voice of_\add +the\add*_\nd master\nd*:
\v 32 I \add =am\add* the \nd god\nd* of_the fathers of_you, the \nd god\nd* of_G‹H‹Abra'am/('Avərāhām)›H›G, and of_G‹H‹Isa'ak/(Yiʦəḩāq)›H›G, and of_G‹H‹Yakōb/(Ya'aqov)›H›G. And G‹H‹Mōsēs having_become trembling, was_ not _daring to_observe.
\v 33 And the \nd master\nd* said to_him: untie the sandal of_the feet of_you, for the place on which you_have_stood ground is holy.
\v 34 Having_seen, I_saw the mistreatment of_the people of_me in G‹H‹Aiguptos/(Miʦərayim)›H›G, and I_heard of_the groaning of_them, and I_came_down to_rescue them, and now come, I_may_send_ you _out to G‹H‹Aiguptos.
\v 35 This G‹H‹Mōsēs, whom they_disowned having_said: who you appointed ruler and judge. This \add man\add* \nd god\nd* has_sent_out ruler and redeemer, with \add +the\add*_hand of_\add +the\add*_angel having_been_seen by_him in the thorn_bush.
\v 36 This \add man\add* led_ them _out, having_done wonders and signs in the G‹H‹Aiguptos, and in \add +the\add*_Red Sea, and in the desert, forty years.
\v 37 This is G‹H‹Mōsēs/(Mosheh)›H›G the \add man\add* having_said to_the sons of_Rx-G‹H‹Israēl/(Yisərā'ēl)›H›G-Rx: \nd god\nd* will_be_raising_up \add +a\add*_prophet to_you_all, from the brothers of_you_all, like me.
\v 38 This is the \add man\add* having_become in the assembly in the desert, with the angel speaking to_him on Mount G‹H‹Sina, and of_the fathers of_us, who received \add +the\add*_ living _oracles to_give to_you_all, 
\v 39 to_whom the fathers of_us willed not to_become obedient, but they_pushed_away \add ~him\add* and they_were_turned in the hearts of_them to G‹H‹Aiguptos,
\v 40 having_said to_G‹H‹A'arōn/('Aharon)›H›G: make for_us gods who will_be_going_before before_us. For this G‹H‹Mōsēs, who led_out us from \add +the\add*_land of_G‹H‹Aiguptos, we_have_ not _known what became to_him.
\v 41 And they_made_a_calf in those days, and they_brought_up \add +a\add*_sacrifice to_the idol, and they_were_being_gladdened in the works of_the hands of_them.
\v 42 But \nd god\nd* turned, and gave_ them _over to_be_serving unto_the army of_heaven, as it_has_been_written in scroll of_the prophets: you_all_ not _offered victims and sacrifices to_me, forty years. in the desert, house of_Rx-G‹H‹Israēl/(Yisərā'ēl)›H›G-Rx. 
\v 43 And you_all_took_up the tabernacle of_G‹H‹Moloⱪ/(Molekə)›H›G, and the star of_ G‹Ɽemfan›G _the god of_you_all, the images which you_all_made to_be_worshipping before_them. And I_will_be_removing you_all beyond G‹H‹Babulōn/(Bāvel?)›H›G.
\v 44 The tabernacle of_the testimony was with_the fathers of_us in the desert, as directed the \add >one\add* speaking to_G‹H‹Mōsēs, to_make it according_to the pattern that he_had_seen,
\v 45 which also the fathers of_us they_brought_in, having_inherited with \nd G‹H‹Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a)›H›G\nd* in the possession of_the nations, whom \nd god\nd* drove_out from \add +the\add*_face of_the fathers of_us, until the days of_G‹H‹Dauid/(Dāvid)›H›G, 
\v 46 who found favour before \nd god\nd*, and requested to_find \add +a\add*_tent for_the house of_G‹H‹Yakōb/(Ya'aqov)›H›G.
\v 47 But G‹H‹Solomōn/(Shəlmoh)›H›G built \add +the\add*_house for_him.
\v 48 But the highest is_ not _dwelling in handmade \add houses\add*, as the prophet is_saying,
\v 49 heaven \add =is\add* \add +a\add*_throne to_me, and the \add +the\add*_earth \add =is\add* \add +a\add*_footstool of_the feet of_me. What house you_all_will_be_building for_me. \add +The\add*_\nd master\nd* is_saying, or what place \add =is\add* of_the rest of_me. 
\v 50 Not the hand of_me made all these \add >things\add*. 
\v 51 Stiff-necked and uncircumcised in_hearts and the ears, you_all are_ always _opposing against_the holy \nd spirit\nd*, as \add =are\add* the fathers of_you_all, you_all also.
\v 52 Which of_the prophets the fathers of_you_all not persecuted. And they_killed_off the \add >ones\add* having_foretold concerning the advent of_the righteous \add Rx-one-Rx\add*, of_whom now you_all became betrayers and murderers. 
\v 53 Who received the law in \add +the\add*_ordinance of_angels, and not kept \add it\add*.
\v 54 And hearing these \add >things\add*, they_were_being_cut_through in_the hearts of_them, and they_were_grating their teeth at him.
\v 55 But being full of_\add +the\add*_ holy _\nd spirit\nd*, having_looked_intently into heaven, he_saw \add +the\add*_glory of_\nd god\nd*, and \nd G‹H‹Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a)›H›G\nd* having_stood by \add +the\add*_right \add hand\add* of_\nd god\nd*,
\v 56 and said: See I_am_observing the heavens having_been_opened_up, and the son of_Man having_stood by \add +the\add*_right \add hand\add* of_\nd god\nd*.
\v 57 But having_cried_out with_\add +a\add*_ loud _voice, they_held the ears of_them, and they_rushed with_one_accord on him.
\v 58 And having_throw_out \add ~him\add* out the city, they_were_stoning. And the witnesses put_away the robes of_them, before the feet of_\add +a\add*_young_man being_named G‹H‹Saulos/(Shā'ūl)›H›G.
\v 59 And they_were_stoning G‹Stefanos›G, ˱who˲_calling and saying: \nd master\nd* \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd*, receive the spirit of_me.
\v 60 And having_knelt on_his knees, he_cried_out with_\add +a\add*_ loud _voice: \nd master\nd*, you_may_ not _set this sin to_them. And having_said this, he_was_fallen_asleep.
\c 8
\v 1 And G‹H‹Saulos was consenting to_the killing of_him. And \add +a\add*_ great _persecution became on that day, against the assembly, which \add was\add* in G‹H‹Hierousalēm/(Yərūshālam)›H›G. And all were_dispersed throughout the regions of_Rx-G‹Youdaia›G-Rx and G‹H‹Samareia/(Shomərōn)›H›G, except the ambassadors.
\v 2 And devout men buried G‹Stefanos›G, and they_made great lamentation over him.
\v 3 But G‹H‹Saulos was_ravaging the assembly, by entering_in the houses, dragging both men and women, he_was_giving_over \add them\add* to prison.
\v 4 The \add >ones\add* therefore on_one_hand having_been_dispersed, passed_through gospel_preaching the word.
\v 5 On_the_other_hand Rx-G‹Filippos›G-Rx having_come_down to \add +a\add*_city of_G‹H‹Samareia, was_proclaiming the \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd* to_them.
\v 6 and the crowds /Were/_taking_heed to_the \add >things\add* being_spoken by Rx-G‹Filippos›G-Rx with_one_accord, in the \add time\add* to_be_hearing them and to_be_seeing the signs that he_was_doing.
\v 7 For many of_the \add >ones\add* having unclean spirits, shouting with_\add +a\add*_ loud _voice, they_were_coming_out, and many having_been_paralyzed and lame were_healed.
\v 8 and great joy became in that city.
\v 9 And \add +a\add*_man certain by_\add +the\add*_name Rx-G‹Simōn›G-Rx, was_previously_starting in the city practicing_magic, and amazing the people of_G‹H‹Samareia, saying himself to_be someone great.
\v 10 To_whom all from small to great were_giving_heed saying: This is the power of_\nd god\nd*, being_called great.
\v 11 And they_were_giving_heed to_him, because_of that to_have_amazed them with_the magic for_much time.
\v 12 But when they_believed in_Rx-G‹Filippos›G-Rx, gospel_preaching concerning the kingdom the of_\nd god\nd* and the name of_\nd G‹H‹Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a)›H›G\nd* \nd chosen_one\nd*, they_were_being_immersed both men and women.
\v 13 And Rx-G‹Simōn›G-Rx himself also believed, and having_been_immersed, was continuing with_Rx-G‹Filippos›G-Rx, observing both signs and great miracles becoming, he_was_Rx-marvelling-Rx.
\v 14 And the ambassadors in G‹H‹Hierousalēm having_heard that G‹H‹Samareia has_received the word of_\nd god\nd*, they_sent_out G‹Petros›G and G‹Yōannēs›G to them,
\v 15 who having_come_down, they_prayed for them, so_that they_may_receive \add +the\add*_ holy _\nd spirit\nd*.
\v 16 For it_was not_yet having_fallen_on on no_one of_them, but they_were_ only _being having_been_immersed into the name of_the \nd master\nd* \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd*.
\v 17 Then they_were_laying_on their hands on them, and they_were_receiving \add +the\add*_ holy _\nd spirit\nd*.
\v 18 And Rx-G‹Simōn›G-Rx having_seen that the \nd spirit\nd* is_being_given by the laying_on of_the hands of_the ambassadors, he_offered money to_them
\v 19 saying: Give to_also_me this authority, in_order_that on_whom I_may_lay_on my hands, he_may_be_receiving \add +the\add*_ holy _\nd spirit\nd*.
\v 20 But G‹Petros›G said to him: The silver of_you, it_might_be to destruction with you, because you_thought to_be_acquiring the gift of_\nd god\nd* by money.
\v 21 ˱There˲_is no portion nor lot to_you in this matter. For the heart of_you not is right before \nd god\nd*.
\v 22 Therefore repent of this evil of_you, and be_besought of_the \nd master\nd* if perhaps the intention of_the heart of_you will_be_being_forgiven to_you.
\v 23 For I_am_seeing you being in \add +the\add*_gall of_bitterness and \add +the\add*_bond of_unrighteousness.
\v 24 But Rx-G‹Simōn›G-Rx answering said: You_all Be_besought for me to the \nd master\nd*, so_that nothing of_which you_all_have_spoken may_come_over on me.
\v 25 Therefore they indeed, having_testified and having_spoken the word of_the \nd master\nd*, were_returning to G‹H‹Hierousalēm/(Yərūshālam)›H›G, and they_were_evangelizing many villages of_the G‹H‹Samareitēs/(Shomərōn)›H›G.
\v 26 But \add +an\add*_angel of_\add +the\add*_\nd master\nd* spoke to Rx-G‹Filippos›G-Rx saying: Rise_up and be_going to \add +the\add*_south, to the road coming_down from G‹H‹Hierousalēm to G‹H‹Gaza/('Azzāh)›H›G, this is \add +the\add*_desert \add road\add*.
\v 27 And having_risen_up, he_was_gone, and see, \add +a\add*_man, \add +an\add*_G‹H‹Aithiops/(Kūshiy)›H›G eunuch, official of_G‹Kandakē›G queen of_\add +the\add*_G‹H‹Aithiopss, who was over all the treasure of_her, had_come going_to_worship in G‹H‹Hierousalēm,
\v 28 and he_was returning and sitting in the chariot of_him, and was_reading the prophet G‹H‹Ēsaias/(Yəsha'əyāh)›H›G.
\v 29 And the \nd spirit\nd* said to_Rx-G‹Filippos›G-Rx: Approach and be_joined_together to_ this _chariot.
\v 30 And Rx-G‹Filippos›G-Rx having_run_up, heard of_him reading G‹H‹Ēsaias the prophet, and said: Then surely you_are_knowing what you_are_reading. 
\v 31 And he said: For how I_might_be_able if not someone will_be_guiding me. And he_appealed to_Rx-G‹Filippos›G-Rx having_gone_up to_sit_down with him.
\v 32 And the passage of_scripture which he_was_reading was this: he_was_led as \add +a\add*_sheep to \add +the\add*_slaughter, and silent as \add +a\add*_lamb before the \add >one\add* having_shaved him, thus he_is_ not _opening_up the mouth of_him.
\v 33 In humiliation, the justice of_him was_taken_away, who will_be_describing the generation of_him. Because the life of_him is_being_taken_away from the earth.
\v 34 And the eunuch answering to_Rx-G‹Filippos›G-Rx said: I_am_beseeching of_you concerning whom the prophet is_saying this. Concerning himself or concerning someone other. 
\v 35 And Rx-G‹Filippos›G-Rx having_opened_up the mouth of_him, and having_begun from this scripture, he_gospel_preached \nd G‹H‹Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a)›H›G\nd* to_him.
\v 36 And as they_were_going along the road, they_came to some water, and the eunuch is_saying: See water, what is_forbidding me to_be_immersed. 
\v 37
\v 38 And he_commanded the chariot to_stop, and they_ both _came_down, to the water, both Rx-G‹Filippos›G-Rx and the eunuch, and he_immersed him.
\v 39 But when they_went_up out_of the water, \add +the\add*_\nd spirit\nd* of_\add +the\add*_\nd master\nd* snatched Rx-G‹Filippos›G-Rx, and the eunuch not saw him no_longer, for he_was_going the way of_him rejoicing.
\v 40 But Rx-G‹Filippos›G-Rx was_found at G‹H‹Azōtos/('Ashədōd)›H›G, and passing_through he_was_gospel_preaching to_ all _the cities, until the \add time\add* him to_come to G‹Kaisareia›G.
\c 9
\v 1 But G‹H‹Saulos/(Shā'ūl)›H›G, still breathing of_threat and murder toward the apprentices/followers of_the \nd master\nd*, having_approached to_the chief_priest,
\v 2 he_requested letters from him to the synagogues into G‹H‹Damaskos/(Dammeseq)›H›G, so_that if he_may_find any of_the way, being both men and women, having_been_bound he_may_bring \add them\add* to G‹H‹Hierousalēm/(Yərūshālam)›H›G.
\v 3 And in the \add time\add* to_be_going, it_became him to_be_nearing to_G‹H‹Damaskos, and suddenly \add +a\add*_light from the sky. flashed_around. him.
\v 4 And having_fallen on the ground, he_heard \add +a\add*_voice saying to_him: G‹H‹Saulos, G‹H‹Saulos, why are_you_persecuting me. 
\v 5 And he_said: Who are_you, master. and_ He _\add said\add*: I am \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd*, whom you are_persecuting, 
\v 6 but rise_up and come_in into the city, and it_will_be_being_spoken to_you what something it_is_fitting you to_be_doing.
\v 7 And the men who travelling_with with_him had_stood speechless, hearing on_one_hand of_the voice, on_the_other_hand observing no_one.
\v 8 And G‹H‹Saulos was_raised from the ground, and the eyes of_him having_been_opened_up, he_was_seeing nothing. And leading_ him _by_hand, they_brought_in \add ~him\add* to G‹H‹Damaskos.
\v 9 And he_was three days not seeing, and neither he_ate nor he_drank.
\v 10 And was \add +a\add*_certain apprentice/follower in G‹H‹Damaskos by_\add +the\add*_name Rx-G‹Ananias›G-Rx, and the \nd master\nd* said to him in \add +a\add*_vision: Rx-G‹Ananias›G-Rx. And he said: See \add it_is\add* I, \nd master\nd*.
\v 11 And the \nd master\nd* to him: Having_risen_up, be_gone in the street being_called Straight, and seek G‹H‹Saulos by_\add +the\add*_name G‹from_Tarsos›G in \add +the\add*_house of_G‹H‹Youdas/(Yəhūdāh)›H›G, for see, he_is_praying
\v 12 and he_saw \add +a\add*_man in \add +a\add*_vision, by_\add +the\add*_name Rx-G‹Ananias›G-Rx, having_come_in and having_put_on \add ^his\add*_hands on_him, so_that he_may_receive_sight.
\v 13 And Rx-G‹Ananias›G-Rx answered: \nd master\nd*, I_heard from many concerning this man, as_much_as he_did evil to_the holy \add >ones\add* of_you, in G‹H‹Hierousalēm, 
\v 14 and here he_is_having authority from the chief_priests, to_bind all calling the name of_you.
\v 15 But the \nd master\nd* said to him: Be_going, because this \add man\add* is \add +a\add*_vessel of_choice to_me, to_bear the name of_me both before the pagans also kings, and \add +the\add*_sons of_Rx-G‹H‹Israēl/(Yisərā'ēl)›H›G-Rx,
\v 16 for I will_be_showing to_him as_much_as it_is_fitting him to_suffer for the name of_me.
\v 17 And Rx-G‹Ananias›G-Rx went_away and came_in into the house, and having_laid_on on him his hands he_said: G‹H‹Saulos/(Shā'ūl)›H›G, brother, the \nd master\nd* has_sent_out me \nd G‹H‹Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a)›H›G\nd*, the \add >one\add* having_been_seen by_you on the road in_which you_were_coming, so_that you_may_receive_sight and may_be_filled with_\add +the\add*_ holy _\nd spirit\nd*.
\v 18 And immediately fell_away \add something\add* of_him from the eyes like scales, and, he_received_sight, and having_risen_up he_was_immersed,
\v 19 and having_taken food, was_strengthened. And he_became some days with the apprentices/followers in G‹H‹Damaskos/(Dammeseq)›H›G.
\v 20 And immediately in the synagogues, he_was_proclaiming \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* that this \add >one\add* is the son of_\nd god\nd*.
\v 21 And all were_Rx-marvelling-Rx hearing, and they_were_saying: Is not this the \add >one\add* having_persecuted the \add >ones\add* calling this name in, G‹H‹Hierousalēm/(Yərūshālam)›H›G, and here for this he_had_come, in_order_that having_been_bound, he_may_bring them to the chief_priests. 
\v 22 But G‹H‹Saulos was_being_ more _strengthened, and was_confounding G‹Youdaiōns›G dwelling in G‹H‹Damaskos, teaching that this \add >one\add* is the \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd*.
\v 23 And when many days were_being_fulfilled, the G‹Youdaiōns›G plotted_together to_kill him, 
\v 24 but the plot of_them was_known to_G‹H‹Saulos. and They_were_watching_closely also the gates both day and night, so_that they_may_kill him, 
\v 25 and the apprentices/followers of_him having_taken \add ~him\add* by_night through the wall, they_let_ him _down, having_lowered \add ~him\add* in \add +a\add*_basket.
\v 26 And having_arrived in G‹H‹Hierousalēm, he_was_attempting to_be_being_joined_together to_the apprentices/followers. But all were_fearing him, not believing that he_is \add +a\add*_apprentice/follower.
\v 27 But G‹Barnabas›G having_taken_hold_of him, brought \add ~him\add* to the ambassadors, and described to_them how he_saw the \nd master\nd* on the road, and that he_spoke to_him, and how he_spoke_boldly in G‹H‹Damaskos in the name of_\nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd*.
\v 28 And he_was with them, entering_in and going_out into G‹H‹Hierousalēm, speaking_boldly in the name of_the \nd master\nd*.
\v 29 He_was_ both _speaking and was_debating with the G‹Hellēnistēs›G, but they were_attempting to_kill him.
\v 30 But having_known \add it\add*, the brothers brought_ him _down to G‹Kaisareia›G, and they_sent_ him _away to G‹Tarsos›G.
\v 31 The indeed Therefore assembly throughout all of_Rx-G‹Youdaia›G-Rx, and G‹H‹Galilaia/(Gālīl)›H›G, and G‹H‹Samareia/(Shomərōn)›H›G, was_having peace, being_built and going in_the fear of_the \nd master\nd*, and it_was_being_multiplied in_the exhortation of_the holy \nd spirit\nd*.
\v 32 And it_became G‹Petros›G passing_through through all \add regions\add*, to_come_down also to the holy \add >ones\add* dwelling_in G‹H‹Ludda/(Lod)›H›G.
\v 33 And he_found there \add +a\add*_ certain _man by_\add +the\add*_name G‹Aineas›G, lying_down for eight years on \add +a\add*_pallet, who was having_been_paralyzed.
\v 34 And G‹Petros›G said to_him: G‹Aineas›G, \nd G‹H‹Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a)›H›G\nd* \nd chosen_one\nd* is_healing you, rise_up, and make_the_bed for_yourself. And immediately he_rose_up.
\v 35 And all the \add >ones\add* dwelling_in G‹H‹Ludda and G‹H‹Assarōn/(Shārōn)›H›G, saw him, who turned_back to the \nd master\nd*.
\v 36 And in G‹Yoppē›G was \add +a\add*_certain apprentice/follower by_\add +the\add*_name G‹Tabētha›G, which being_interpreted is_being_called: \add +the\add*_Gazelle|G‹Dorkas›G. She was full of_ good _works, and of_alms that she_was_doing.
\v 37 And it_became in those days, she having_ailed to_die_off. And having_washed her they_put in \add +an\add*_upper_room.
\v 38 And G‹H‹Ludda being near to_G‹Yoppē›G, the apprentices/followers having_heard that G‹Petros›G is in it, they_sent_out two men to him imploring: You_may_ not _delay to_pass_through to us.
\v 39 And G‹Petros›G having_risen_up, came_together with_them, who having_arrived, they_brought_up into the upper_room, and all the widows stood_by by_him, weeping and showing \add +the\add*_tunics and clothes, as_much_as G‹Dorkas›G was_making being with them.
\v 40 But G‹Petros›G having_throw_out all outside, and having_knelt his knees he_prayed, and having_turned_back to the body said: G‹Tabētha›G, rise_up. And she opened_up the eyes of_her, and having_seen G‹Petros›G, she_sat_up.
\v 41 And having_given \add ^his\add*_hand to_her, he_raised_ her _up, and having_called the holy \add >ones\add* and the widows, he_presented her living.
\v 42 And it_became known throughout all of_G‹Yoppē›G, and many believed on the \nd master\nd*.
\v 43 And it_became many days to_remain in G‹Yoppē›G, with \add +a\add*_certain Rx-G‹Simōn›G-Rx, \add +a\add*_tanner.
\c 10
\v 1 And \add +a\add*_ certain _man in G‹Kaisareia›G by_\add +the\add*_name G‹Kornēlios›G, \add +a\add*_centurion of of_\add +the\add*_Cohort being_called G‹from_Italia›G,
\v 2 devout and revering \nd god\nd* with all the household of_him, doing many alms to_the people, and beseeching of_\nd god\nd* through everything.
\v 3 About \add +the\add*_ninth hour of_the day he_saw in \add +a\add*_vision clearly, as_if, \add +an\add*_angel of_\nd god\nd* having_come_in to him, and having_said to_him: G‹Kornēlios›G. 
\v 4 And he, having_looked_intently at_him and having_become frightened, said: What is_it, master. And he_said to_him: The prayers of_you, and the alms of_you, went_up for \add +a\add*_memorial before \nd god\nd*.
\v 5 And now send men to G‹Yoppē›G, and send_for \add +a\add*_certain Rx-G‹Simōn›G-Rx, who is_being_called G‹Petros›G.
\v 6 This \add >one\add* is_being_lodged with \add +a\add*_certain Rx-G‹Simōn›G-Rx \add +a\add*_tanner, whose house is by \add +the\add*_sea.
\v 7 And when the angel speaking to_him, went_away, having_called two of_the house_servants and \add +a\add*_ devout _soldier of_the \add >ones\add* continuing with_him,
\v 8 and having_explained all \add >things\add* to_them, he_sent_ them _out to G‹Yoppē›G.
\v 9 And on_the \add day\add* of_next, those journeying and nearing to_the city, G‹Petros›G went_up on the housetop to_pray, about \add +the\add*_hour sixth.
\v 10 But he_became hungry and was_wanting to_taste, but them preparing, \add +a\add*_trance became on him,
\v 11 and he_is_observing heaven having_been_opened_up, and \add +an\add*_ certain _object coming_down, as \add +a\add*_ by_four _linen_sheet, great corners being_let_down on the earth,
\v 12 in which was_being all the quadrupeds, and reptiles of_the earth, and birds of_the sky.
\v 13 And \add +a\add*_voice became to him: Having_risen_up, G‹Petros›G, sacrifice and eat. 
\v 14 But G‹Petros›G said: By_no_means, \nd master\nd*, because I_ never _ate any common and unclean \add >thing\add*.
\v 15 And \add +a\add*_voice \add said\add* again for \add +the\add*_second \add time\add* to him: What \nd god\nd* cleansed, you be_ not _defiling.
\v 16 And this became for thrice, and immediately the object was_taken_up into heaven.
\v 17 And while G‹Petros›G by himself was_thoroughly_perplexing, what might_be the vision that he_saw, see, the men having_been_sent_out from G‹Kornēlios›G, having_inquired for_the house of_Rx-G‹Simōn›G-Rx, stood_by at the gate.
\v 18 And having_called, they_were_inquiring if Rx-G‹Simōn›G-Rx, who \add =is\add* being_called G‹Petros›G, is_being_lodged here.
\v 19 And G‹Petros›G pondering about the vision, the \nd spirit\nd* said, to_him: See three men are_seeking you.
\v 20 But having_risen_up, come_down and be_going with them, doubting nothing, because I have_sent_ them _out.
\v 21 And G‹Petros›G having_come_down, to the men said: See I am whom you_all_are_seeking, what \add =is\add* the cause for which you_all_are_coming. 
\v 22 And they said: G‹Kornēlios›G \add +a\add*_centurion, righteous man and revering \nd god\nd*, and being_attested by all the nation of_the G‹Youdaiōns›G, was_called by \add +an\add*_ holy _angel, to_send_for you to the house of_him, and to_hear words from you.
\v 23 Therefore having_called_ them _in. he_lodged. And on_the \add day\add* of_next having_risen_up, he_came_out with them, and some of_the brothers from G‹Yoppē›G came_together with_him.
\v 24 And on_the \add day\add* of_next, he_came_in into G‹Kaisareia›G. And G‹Kornēlios›G was expecting them, having_called_together the relatives of_him and close friends.
\v 25 And as it_became G‹Petros›G, to_come_in G‹Kornēlios›G having_met with_him , having_fallen at his feet, he_worshipped \add ~him\add*.
\v 26 But G‹Petros›G raised him saying: Rise_up, I also myself am \add +a\add*_human.
\v 27 And conversing with_him, he_came_in and he_is_finding many having_come_together.
\v 28 And he_was_saying to them: You_all are_knowing how unlawful it_is for_\add +a\add*_ G‹Youdaiōns›G _man to_be_being_joined_together or to_be_approaching to_\add +an\add*_other_tribe. \nd god\nd* to_and_ showed _me, to_be_calling not_one \add +a\add*_person common or unclean.
\v 29 Therefore also having_been_sent_for I_came unquestionably. Therefore I_am_inquiring for_what statement you_all_sent_for me. 
\v 30 And G‹Kornēlios›G was_saying: From fourth day until this hour, I_was praying in the house of_me the ninth \add hour\add*, and see, \add +a\add*_man stood before me in shining clothing,
\v 31 and he_is_saying: G‹Kornēlios›G, the prayer of_you was_listened_to and the alms of_you were_reminded before \nd god\nd*.
\v 32 Therefore send to G‹Yoppē›G and summon Rx-G‹Simōn›G-Rx, who is_being_called G‹Petros›G, this \add >one\add* is_being_lodged in \add +the\add*_house of_Rx-G‹Simōn›G-Rx, \add +a\add*_tanner by \add +the\add*_sea.
\v 33 Therefore I_ immediately _sent to you, and you did well therefore. having_arrived now we all are_being_present before \nd god\nd*, to_hear all the \add >things\add* having_been_commanded to_you by the \nd master\nd*.
\v 34 And G‹Petros›G having_opened_up mouth said: In truth I_am_grasping that \nd god\nd* is not \add +a\add*_favourer,
\v 35 but in every nation, the \add >one\add* revering him and working righteousness, is acceptable to_him.
\v 36 The word he_sent_out to_the sons of_Rx-G‹H‹Israēl/(Yisərā'ēl)›H›G-Rx, gospel_preaching peace through \nd G‹H‹Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a)›H›G\nd* \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd*, this \add >one\add* is \nd master\nd* of_all.
\v 37 You_all have_known the word having_become throughout all Rx-G‹Youdaia›G-Rx, having_begun from G‹H‹Galilaia/(Gālīl)›H›G, after the immersion that G‹Yōannēs›G proclaimed,
\v 38 \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* from G‹Nazaret›G, how \nd god\nd* anointed him with_\add +the\add*_ holy _\nd spirit\nd* and power, who passed_through doing_good and healing all the \add >ones\add* being_oppressed by the devil, because \nd god\nd* was with him.
\v 39 And we \add =are\add* witnesses of_all \add >things\add* that he_did both in the region of_the G‹Youdaiōns›G and in in_G‹H‹Hierousalēm/(Yərūshālam)›H›G, whom also they_killed, having_hanged \add ~him\add* on \add +a\add*_cross.
\v 40 This \add >one\add* \nd god\nd* raised on_the third day, and gave him to_become manifest,
\v 41 not to_all the people, but to_\add +the\add*_witnesses having_been_previously_appointed by \nd god\nd*, to_us, who ate_with and drank_with with_him after the \add time\add* him to_rise_up from \add +the\add*_dead.
\v 42 And he_commanded to_us to_proclaim to_the people, and to_testify that this \add >one\add* is the \add >one\add* having_been_designated by \nd god\nd*, as_judge of_\add +the\add*_living and \add +the\add*_dead.
\v 43 To_this \add >one\add* all the prophets are_testifying, everyone believing in him to_receive forgiveness of_sins through the name of_him.
\v 44 G‹Petros›G still speaking these words, the holy \nd spirit\nd* fell_on on all the \add >ones\add* hearing the word.
\v 45 And the believers from \add +the\add*_circumcision, as_many_as came_together with_G‹Petros›G Rx-marvelled-Rx, that the gift of_the holy \nd spirit\nd* has_been_poured_out even on the pagans.
\v 46 For they_were_hearing of_them speaking with_tongues, and magnifying \nd god\nd*. Then G‹Petros›G answered,
\v 47 Surely_not anyone is_able to_forbid the water these to_ not _be_immersed, who received the holy \nd spirit\nd*, as we_ also _\add did\add*. 
\v 48 and He_commanded them in the name of_\nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* \nd chosen_one\nd* to_be_immersed. Then they_asked him to_remain_on some days.
\c 11
\v 1 And the ambassadors and the brothers being in Rx-G‹Youdaia›G-Rx heard that the pagans also received the word of_\nd god\nd*.
\v 2 and when G‹Petros›G went_up to G‹H‹Hierousalēm, the \add >ones\add* of \add +the\add*_circumcision were_doubting with him,
\v 3 saying, that He_came_in to men, having uncircumcision, and ate_with with_them.
\v 4 But G‹Petros›G having_begun, was_explaining to_them consecutively, saying,
\v 5 I was in \add +the\add*_city of_G‹Yoppē›G praying, and in \add +a\add*_trance I_saw \add +a\add*_vision, \add +an\add*_ certain _object coming_down like \add +a\add*_ by_\add +its\add*_four _linen_sheet, great corners being_let_down out_of heaven, and it_came until me, 
\v 6 on which having_looked_intently I_was_observing, and I_saw the quadrupeds of_the earth, and the wild_beasts, and the reptiles, and the birds of_the sky.
\v 7 And I_ also _heard from_\add +a\add*_voice saying to_me: G‹Petros›G having_risen_up, sacrifice and eat.
\v 8 But I_said By_no_means, \nd master\nd*, because common or unclean never came_in into the mouth of_me.
\v 9 But \add +the\add*_voice answered for \add +a\add*_second \add time\add* out_of heaven: What \nd god\nd* cleansed, you be_ not _defiling.
\v 10 And this became for thrice, and all was_pulled_up again into heaven.
\v 11 And see, immediately three men stood_by at the house in which we_were, having_been_sent_out from G‹Kaisareia›G to me.
\v 12 And the \nd spirit\nd* told to_me, to_come_together with_them, having_doubted nothing. And these six brothers also came with me, and we_came_in into the house of_the man.
\v 13 He_reported and to_us how he_saw the angel in the house of_him, having_been_stood and having_said: Send_out to G‹Yoppē›G, and send_for Rx-G‹Simōn›G-Rx, the \add >one\add* being_called G‹Petros›G,
\v 14 who will_be_speaking words to you, in which you will_be_being_saved and all the household of_you.
\v 15 And at the \add time\add* me to_begin to_be_speaking, the holy \nd spirit\nd* fell_on on them, as also on us in \add +the\add*_beginning.
\v 16 And I_was_reminded of_the word of_the \nd master\nd*, how he_was_saying: G‹Yōannēs›G on_one_hand immersed with_water, on_the_other_hand you_all will_be_being_immersed with \add +the\add*_ holy _\nd spirit\nd*.
\v 17 Therefore if \nd god\nd* gave the same gift to_them, as also to_us having_believed on the \nd master\nd* \nd G‹H‹Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a)›H›G\nd* \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd*, who was I powerful to_forbid \nd god\nd*. 
\v 18 And having_heard these \add >things\add*, they_kept_quiet and glorified \nd god\nd* saying: Consequently \nd god\nd* also gave repentance to life to_the pagans.
\v 19 The \add >ones\add* therefore indeed having_been_dispersed by the tribulation having_become concerning G‹Stefanos›G, passed_through to G‹Foinikē›G, and G‹Kupros›G, and G‹Antioⱪeia›G, speaking the word to_no_one except only to_G‹Youdaiōns›G.
\v 20 But were some of them men, G‹from_Kupros›Gs and G‹\add >ones\add*from_Kurēnē›G, who having_come into G‹Antioⱪeia›G, were_speaking also to the G‹Hellēns›G, gospel_preaching the \nd master\nd* \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd*.
\v 21 And \add +the\add*_hand of_\add +the\add*_\nd master\nd* was with them, and \add +a\add*_great number having_believed, turned_back to the \nd master\nd*.
\v 22 And the word concerning them was_heard in the ears of_the assembly being in G‹H‹Hierousalēm/(Yərūshālam)›H›G, and they_sent_away G‹Barnabas›G as_far_as G‹Antioⱪeia›G, 
\v 23 who having_arrived, and having_seen the grace of_\nd god\nd*, was_elated and was_exhorting all to_be_remaining with_the \nd master\nd* with_purpose of_heart,
\v 24 because he_was \add +a\add*_ good _man, and full of_\add +the\add*_ holy _\nd spirit\nd* and of_faith. And \add +a\add*_ large _crowd was_added to_the \nd master\nd*.
\v 25 And he_came_out to G‹Tarsos›G to_seek_out G‹H‹Saulos/(Shā'ūl)›H›G,
\v 26 and having_found \add ~him\add*, he_brought \add ~him\add* to G‹Antioⱪeia›G. And it_became to_them also to_be_gathered_together in the assembly \add +a\add*_ whole _year, and to_teach \add +a\add*_ large _crowd, and to_call first the apprentices/followers, followers_of_the_messiah. in. G‹Antioⱪeia›G.
\v 27 And in these days, prophets came_down from G‹H‹Hierousalēm to G‹Antioⱪeia›G.
\v 28 And one from them by_\add +the\add*_name G‹Agabos›G having_stood_up, signified by the \nd spirit\nd*, \add +a\add*_ great _famine to_be_going going_to_be over all the inhabited_world, which became during G‹Klaudios›G.
\v 29 And as anyone of_the apprentices/followers was_prospering, each of_them designated to_send for service to_the brothers dwelling in Rx-G‹Youdaia›G-Rx, 
\v 30 which they_ also _did, having_sent_out \add it\add* to the elders by \add +the\add*_hand of_G‹Barnabas›G and G‹H‹Saulos.
\c 12
\v 1 And concerning that time, Rx-G‹Hērōdēs›G-Rx the king laid_on \add ^his\add*_hands to_mistreat some of_the \add >ones\add* from the assembly.
\v 2 And he_killed G‹H‹Yakōbos/(Ya'aqov)›H›G, the brother of_G‹Yōannēs›G, with_\add +a\add*_sword.
\v 3 And having_seen that is pleasing it_the G‹Youdaiōns›G, he_proceeded to_ also _capture G‹Petros›G (and those_were \add +the\add*_days of_non-fermented \add bread\add*),
\v 4 whom also having_arrested, he_put in prison, having_given_over \add ~him\add* to_four squads_of_four of_soldiers to_be_guarding him, wishing after the passover_\add feast\add* to_bring_ him _up to_the people.
\v 5 therefore on_one_hand G‹Petros›G was_being_kept in the prison, on_the_other_hand prayer was earnestly becoming by the assembly to \nd god\nd* concerning him.
\v 6 And when Rx-G‹Hērōdēs›G-Rx was_going to_bring_ him _forth on_ that _night, G‹Petros›G was being_fallen_asleep between two soldiers, having_been_bound with_ two _chains, and guards before the door were_guarding the prison.
\v 7 And see, \add +an\add*_angel of_\add +the\add*_\nd master\nd* stood_by, and \add +a\add*_light shined in the prison_cell. And having_struck the side of_G‹Petros›G, he_raised him saying: Rise_up in quickness. And the chains from his hands fell_from. of_him.
\v 8 And the angel said to him: Gird \add yourself\add* and tie_on the sandals of_you. And he_did thus. And he_is_saying to_him: Clothe the coat of_you, and be_following after_me.
\v 9 And having_come_out he_was_following, and he_had_ not _known that what becoming by the angel is true, but he_was_supposing to_be_seeing \add +a\add*_vision.
\v 10 And having_passed_through \add +the\add*_first guard and \add +the\add*_second, they_came to the iron gate, leading into the city, which automatic was_opened_up to_them, and having_come_out they_went_ahead on_ one _street, and immediately the angel withdrew from him.
\v 11 And G‹Petros›G having_become to himself said: Now I_have_ truly _known that \nd master\nd* sent_away the angel of_him, and rescued me out_of \add +the\add*_hand of_Rx-G‹Hērōdēs›G-Rx and all the expectation of_the people of_the G‹Youdaiōns›G.
\v 12 And having_become_aware_of \add it\add*, he_came to the house of_G‹H‹Maria/(Mirəyām)›H›G, the mother of_G‹Yōannēs›G, who \add =is\add* being_called Rx-G‹Markos›G-Rx, where many were having_been_convened_together and praying.
\v 13 And of_him having_knocked the door of_the gate, \add +a\add*_servant_girl by_\add +the\add*_name G‹Ɽodē›G went_ahead to_answer.
\v 14 And having_recognized the voice of_G‹Petros›G, from joy she_ not _opened_up the gate, but having_run_in she_reported G‹Petros›G to_have_stood before the gate.
\v 15 And they to her said: You_are_raving_mad. But she was_insisting to_be_having thus. And they were_saying: It_is the angel of_him.
\v 16 But G‹Petros›G was_continuing_on knocking, and having_opened_up \add it\add* they_saw him, and they_Rx-marvelled-Rx.
\v 17 But having_gestured to_them with_his hand to_be_keeping_silent, he_described how the \nd master\nd* led_ him _out from the prison. And he_said: Report these \add >things\add* to_G‹H‹Yakōbos/(Ya'aqov)›H›G and to_the brothers. And having_come_out, he_was_gone to another place.
\v 18 And having_become day, there_was no little disturbance among the soldiers, what consequently became G‹Petros›G.
\v 19 And Rx-G‹Hērōdēs›G-Rx having_sought_after him and not having_found \add ~him\add*, having_examined the guards, commanded \add them\add* to_be_led_away \add to_death\add*. And having_come_down from Rx-G‹Youdaia›G-Rx to G‹Kaisareia›G, he_was_staying.
\v 20 And he_was raging with_\add +the\add*_G‹H‹Turos/(Tsor)›H›G and G‹H‹Sidōn/(Tsīdōn)›H›G, and with_one_accord they_were_coming to him, and having_persuaded G‹Blastos›G, who \add was\add* over the bedchamber of_the king, they_were_requesting peace, because_of that the region of_them to_be_being_nourished by the royal.
\v 21 And on_\add +the\add*_appointed day, Rx-G‹Hērōdēs›G-Rx, having_dressed_in \add +the\add*_royal clothing, having_sat_down on the tribunal, was_publicly_addressing to them.
\v 22 And the public was_crying_out: \add +The\add*_voice of_\add +a\add*_\nd god\nd*, and not of_\add +a\add*_human. 
\v 23 And immediately \add +an\add*_angel of_\add +the\add*_\nd master\nd* struck him, for that he_ not _gave the glory to_\nd god\nd*, and having_become worm-infested, he_stopped_breathing.
\v 24 But the word of_the of_\nd god\nd* was_growing and was_being_multiplied.
\v 25 And G‹Barnabas›G and G‹H‹Saulos/(Shā'ūl)›H›G returned to G‹H‹Hierousalēm/(Yərūshālam)›H›G, having_fulfilled the service, having_taken_along_with \add them\add* G‹Yōannēs›G, having_been_called Rx-G‹Markos›G-Rx.
\c 13
\v 1 And there_were prophets and teachers in G‹Antioⱪeia›G, in the assembly being: jointly G‹Barnabas›G, and G‹H‹Sumeōn/(Shimə'ōn)›H›G who being_called G‹Niger›G, and G‹Loukios›G the G‹from_Kurēnē›G, And G‹Manaēn›G raised_with of_Rx-G‹Hērōdēs›G-Rx of_the quarter_ruler, and G‹H‹Saulos.
\v 2 And of_them ministering to_the \nd master\nd* and fasting, the holy \nd spirit\nd* said: Indeed set_apart to_me G‹Barnabas›G and G‹H‹Saulos, for the work which I_have_called_ them _to.
\v 3 Then having_fasted, and having_prayed, and having_laid_on their hands on_them, they_sent_away \add them\add*.
\v 4 Therefore indeed They having_been_sent_out by holy \nd spirit\nd*, came_down to G‹Seleukeia›G, and from_there they_sailed_away to G‹Kupros›G.
\v 5 And having_become in G‹Salamis›G, they_were_proclaiming the word of_the of_\nd god\nd* in the synagogues of_the G‹Youdaiōns›G. And they_were_ also _having G‹Yōannēs›G, \add +an\add*_attendant.
\v 6 And having_passed_through all the island until G‹Pafos›G, they_found \add +a\add*_man, \add +a\add*_certain G‹Youdaiōns›G false_prophet magician, to_whose name \add was\add* G‹Bariēsous›G,
\v 7 who was with the proconsul G‹Sergios›G G‹Paulos›G, \add +a\add*_ intelligent _man. He, having_called_to G‹Barnabas›G and G‹H‹Saulos, sought_after to_hear the word of_\nd god\nd*.
\v 8 But G‹Elumas›G the magician (for thus is_being_translated the name of_him was_resisting against_them) seeking to_pervert the proconsul from the faith.
\v 9 But G‹H‹Saulos, the \add >one\add* also \add called\add* G‹Paulos›G, having_been_filled with_\add +the\add*_ holy _\nd spirit\nd*, having_looked_intently at him
\v 10 said: Rx-Oh-Rx son of_\add +the\add*_devil full of_all deceit and all fraud, enemy of_all righteousness, not will_you_be_ceasing perverting the straight ways of_the \nd master\nd*. 
\v 11 And now see, \add +the\add*_hand of_\add +the\add*_\nd master\nd* on you, and you_will_be blind, not seeing the sun until \add +a\add*_season. and immediately \add +a\add*_mist and darkness fell on him, and going_around he_was_seeking one_leading_by_hand.
\v 12 Then the proconsul having_seen what having_become, he_believed being_astonished at the teaching of_the \nd master\nd*.
\v 13 And the \add >ones\add* around \add ~him\add* G‹Paulos›G having_been_launched from G‹Pafos›G, came to Rx-G‹Pergē›G-Rx of_G‹Pamfulia›G. But G‹Yōannēs›G having_went_away from them, he_returned to G‹H‹Hierousalēm.
\v 14 But they, having_passed_through from Rx-G‹Pergē›G-Rx, arrived to G‹Antioⱪeia›G G‹Pisidia›G, and having_come into the synagogue on_the day of_the sabbaths, they_sat_down.
\v 15 And after the public_reading of_the law and of_the prophets, the synagogue_leaders sent_out to them saying: Men, brothers, if among you_all there_is any word of_exhortation toward the people, be_speaking \add it\add*.
\v 16 And G‹Paulos›G having_stood_up, and having_gestured with_his hand said: Men, G‹H‹\add >ones\add*_from_Israēl/(Yisərā'ēl)›H›G, and you_all revering \nd god\nd*, hear \add me\add*.
\v 17 The \nd god\nd* of_the people of_this Rx-G‹H‹Israēl/(Yisərā'ēl)›H›G-Rx chose the fathers of_us, and exalted the people in the sojourn in \add +the\add*_land of_G‹H‹Aiguptos/(Miʦərayim)›H›G, and with \add ^his\add*_arm high, he_led_out them out_of it,
\v 18 and \add +the\add*_time he_sustained them in the desert about, forty_year,
\v 19 and having_taken_down seven nations in \add +the\add*_land of_Rx-G‹H‹Ⱪana'an/(Kina'an)›H›G-Rx, he_passed_down the land of_them, 
\v 20 about four_hundred years and fifty. And after these \add >things\add*, he_gave \add them\add* judges until G‹H‹Samouēl/(Shəmū'ēl)›H›G \add +the\add*_prophet.
\v 21 And_from_there they_requested \add +a\add*_king, and \nd god\nd* gave to_them G‹H‹Saulos/(Shā'ūl)›H›G, son of_Rx-G‹H‹Kis/(Qīsh)›H›G-Rx, \add +a\add*_man of \add +the\add*_tribe of_G‹H‹Beniamin/(Binəyāmīn)›H›G, for_ forty _years.
\v 22 And having_removed him, he_raised G‹H‹Dauid/(Dāvid)›H›G to_them for \add +a\add*_king, to_whom also he_spoke having_testified: I_found G‹H‹Dauid the \add son\add* of_G‹H‹Yessai/(Yishay)›H›G: \add +a\add*_man according_to the heart of_me, who will_be_doing all the wills of_me.
\v 23 Of the seed of_this \add >one\add* \nd god\nd* according_to promise, brought to_Rx-G‹H‹Israēl/(Yisərā'ēl)›H›G-Rx \add +a\add*_Rx-saviour-Rx, \nd G‹H‹Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a)›H›G\nd*,
\v 24 of_G‹Yōannēs›G having_publicly_proclaimed before \add +the\add*_face of_the entrance of_him, \add +a\add*_immersion of_repentance to_all the people of_Rx-G‹H‹Israēl/(Yisərā'ēl)›H›G-Rx.
\v 25 And while G‹Yōannēs›G was_fulfilling the course, he_was_saying: What you_all_are_suspecting me to_be. I am_ not _\add he\add*, but see, he_is_coming after me, of_whom I_am not worthy to_untie the sandal of_his feet.
\v 26 Men, brothers, sons of_\add +the\add*_descent of_G‹H‹Abra'am/('Avərāhām)›H›G, and you_all among you_all revering \nd god\nd*, to_us the word of_ this _salvation was_sent_away.
\v 27 For the \add >ones\add* dwelling in G‹H‹Hierousalēm/(Yərūshālam)›H›G and the rulers of_them, having_not_known this \add >one\add* and the voices of_the prophets, who being_read on every sabbath, having_judged \add ~him\add* they_fulfilled \add them\add*.
\v 28 And having_found not_one cause for_death, they_requested Rx-G‹Pilatos›G-Rx him to_be_killed.
\v 29 And when they_finished all the \add >things\add* having_been_written concerning him, having_taken_down \add ~him\add* from the cross, they_put \add ~him\add* in \add +a\add*_tomb.
\v 30 But \nd god\nd* raised him from \add +the\add*_dead, 
\v 31 who was_seen for more days, to_the \add >ones\add* having_come_up_with him from G‹H‹Galilaia/(Gālīl)›H›G to G‹H‹Hierousalēm, who are now witnesses of_him to the people.
\v 32 And we are_gospel_preaching to_you_all the the promise having_become to fathers,
\v 33 that \nd god\nd* has_fulfilled this to_the children of_us, having_raised_up \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd*, as also in the second psalm it_has_been_written: you are son of_me, today I have_bore you.
\v 34 And that raised_ him _up from \add +the\add*_dead, no_longer going to_be_returning to decay, thus he_has_said, I_will_be_giving to_you_all the devout faithful of_G‹H‹Dauid.
\v 35 Therefore also in another \add psalm\add* he_is_saying: you will_ not _be_giving the devout \add Rx-one-Rx\add* of_you to_see decay.
\v 36 For on_one_hand G‹H‹Dauid having_attended to_the counsel of_\nd god\nd* to_\add ^his\add*_own generation, was_fallen_asleep and was_added to the fathers of_him, and saw decay.
\v 37 On_the_other_hand which \add >one\add* \nd god\nd* raised not saw decay.
\v 38 Therefore it_let_be known, to_you_all, men, brothers, that through this \add >one\add*, forgiveness of_sins is_being_proclaimed to_you_all, from all \add >things\add* of_which you_all_were_ not _able to_be_justified in \add +the\add*_law of_G‹H‹Mōsēs/(Mosheh)›H›G,
\v 39 everyone believing in this \add >one\add* is_being_justified.
\v 40 Therefore be_watching_out, lest the \add word\add* having_been_said in the prophets may_come_over:
\v 41 watch, you scoffers, and wonder and be_perishing, because I am_doing \add +a\add*_work in the days of_you_all, \add +a\add*_work which by_no_means you_all_may_ not _believe, if someone may_be_describing_in_detail \add it\add* to_you_all.
\v 42 And of_them departing, they_were_imploring these words to_be_spoken to_them on the afterward sabbath.
\v 43 And having_been_released of_the synagogue, many of_the G‹Youdaiōns›G and of_the worshipping converts followed after_G‹Paulos›G and G‹Barnabas›G, who addressing to_them, were_persuading them to_be_remaining in_the grace of_\nd god\nd*.
\v 44 And on_the coming sabbath, almost all the city was_gathered_together to_hear the word of_\nd god\nd*.
\v 45 But the G‹Youdaiōns›G having_seen the crowds, they_were_filled with_jealousy and they_were_speaking_against against_the_ slandering _\add >things\add* being_spoken by G‹Paulos›G.
\v 46 and, G‹Paulos›G and G‹Barnabas›G Having_spoken_boldly said, it_was necessary the word of_\nd god\nd* first to_be_spoken To_you_all. Since and you_all_are_pushing_ it _away, and not worthy you_all_are_judging yourselves of_eternal life, see, we_are_being_turned to the pagans.
\v 47 For thus the \nd master\nd* has_commanded to_us: I_have_set you for \add +a\add*_light of_\add +the\add*_pagans, you to_be for salvation to \add +the\add*_last of_the earth.
\v 48 And hearing \add it\add* the pagans, they_were_rejoicing and were_glorifying the word of_the \nd master\nd*, and as_many_as were having_been_appointed to eternal life believed.
\v 49 And the word of_the \nd master\nd* was_being_carried_through through all the region.
\v 50 But the G‹Youdaiōns›G incited the prominent worshipping women, and the leaders of_the city, and they_stirred_up \add +a\add*_persecution against G‹Paulos›G and G‹Barnabas›G, and they_throw_ them _out from the regions of_them.
\v 51 But they, having_shaken_off the dust of_the feet against them, came to G‹Ikonion›G.
\v 52 And the apprentices/followers were_being_filled with_joy and \add +the\add*_ holy _\nd spirit\nd*.
\c 14
\v 1 And it_became, in G‹Ikonion›G with the same them to_come_in into the synagogue of_the G‹Youdaiōns›G, and to_speak thus so_that \add +a\add*_great multitude of_ both _G‹Youdaiōns›G and G‹Hellēns›G to_believe.
\v 2 But the G‹Youdaiōns›G having_disbelieved stirred_up and mistreated the hearts of_the pagans against the brothers.
\v 3 Therefore on_one_hand they_stayed much time, speaking_boldly for the \nd master\nd*, the \add >one\add* testifying the word of_the grace of_him, to_giving signs and wonders to_be_becoming through the hands of_them.
\v 4 On_the_other_hand the multitude of_the city was_divided, and on_one_hand they were with the G‹Youdaiōns›G, on_the_other_hand they with the ambassadors.
\v 5 And when \add +an\add*_impulse both of_the pagans and G‹Youdaiōns›G with the rulers of_them became, to_mistreat and to_throw_stones at_them,
\v 6 having_become_aware_of, they_fled_down to the cities of_G‹Lukaonia›G, G‹Lustra›G, and G‹Derbē›G, and the surrounding_region,
\v 7 and_there they_were gospel_preaching.
\v 8 And \add +a\add*_certain man, in G‹Lustra›G powerless by_the feet, who never walked was_sitting lame from \add +the\add*_womb of_\add +the\add*_mother of_him.
\v 9 This \add man\add* was_hearing of_G‹Paulos›G speaking, who having_looked_intently at_him and having_seen that he_is_having faith to_be_healed,
\v 10 said with_\add +a\add*_loud voice: Stand_up straight on the feet of_you. And he_sprang_up and was_walking.
\v 11 And the crowds having_seen what G‹Paulos›G did, lifted_up the voice of_them In_G‹Lukaonia›Gn saying: The gods having_been_likened to_men, came_down to us.
\v 12 They_were_calling both G‹Barnabas›G: G‹Zeus›G, and G‹Paulos›G: G‹Hermas›G, since he was the \add >one\add* leading of_the matter.
\v 13 And the \add +the\add*_priest of_G‹Zeus›G, being before the city, having_brought bulls and garlands to the gates, he_was_wanting to_be_sacrificing with the crowds.
\v 14 But the ambassadors G‹Barnabas›G and G‹Paulos›G having_heard, having_torn the robes of_themselves, they_rushed_out into the crowd, crying_out
\v 15 and saying: Men, why are_you_all_doing these \add >things\add*. We also are humans like_natured with_you_all, evangelizing you_all to_be_turning_back from these useless \add >things\add* to living \nd god\nd*: who made the heaven, and the earth, and the sea, and all the \add >things\add* in them.
\v 16 Who in the generations having_gone_by, allowed all the nations to_be_going to_the ways of_them.
\v 17 And_yet left himself not without_witness, working_good from_heaven to_you_all giving rains and fruitful seasons, filling with_food and the hearts of_you_all gladness.
\v 18 And saying these \add >things\add*, with_difficulty they_restrained the crowds not to_be_sacrificing to_them.
\v 19 But G‹Youdaiōns›G Came_over from G‹Antioⱪeia›G and G‹Ikonion›G, and having_persuaded the crowds, and having_stoned G‹Paulos›G, they_were_dragging \add ~him\add* outside the city, thinking him to_have_died.
\v 20 But of_the apprentices/followers having_surrounded him, having_stood_up he_came_in into the city. And on_the \add day\add* of_next he_came_out with G‹Barnabas›G to G‹Derbē›G.
\v 21 And having_gospel_preached that city, and having_apprentice/followerd many, they_returned to G‹Lustra›G, and to G‹Ikonion›G, and to G‹Antioⱪeia›G,
\v 22 strengthening the souls of_the apprentices/followers, exhorting \add them\add* to_be_remaining_in in_the faith, and that it_is_fitting us to_come_in into the kingdom of_\nd god\nd* through many tribulations.
\v 23 And having_chosen elders for_them in assembly, having_prayed with fastings, they_entrusted them to_the \nd master\nd* on whom they_had_believed.
\v 24 And having_passed_through G‹Pisidia›G, they_came to G‹Pamfulia›G,
\v 25 and having_spoken the word of_the \nd master\nd* in Rx-G‹Pergē›G-Rx, they_came_down to Attalia,
\v 26 and_from_there they_sailed_away to G‹Antioⱪeia›G, whence they_were having_been_given_over to_the grace of_\nd god\nd*, for the work that they_fulfilled.
\v 27 And having_arrived and having_gathered_together the assembly, they_were_declaring as_much_as \nd god\nd* did with them, and that he_opened_up \add +a\add*_door of_faith to_the pagans.
\v 28 And they_were_staying no little time with the apprentices/followers.
\c 15
\v 1 And some having_come_down from Rx-G‹Youdaia›G-Rx, were_teaching the brothers, If you_all _may_ not _be_circumcised to_the custom of_G‹H‹Mōsēs/(Mosheh)›H›G, you_all_are_ not _being_able to_be_saved.
\v 2 And dissension and no little debate having_become by_G‹Paulos›G and G‹Barnabas›G with them, they_determined G‹Paulos›G and G‹Barnabas›G and some others from them to_be_going_up, to the ambassadors and elders in G‹H‹Hierousalēm/(Yərūshālam)›H›G about this question.
\v 3 therefore indeed The having_been_sent_forward by the assembly, they_were_passing_through both G‹Foinikē›G and G‹H‹Samareia/(Shomərōn)›H›G, describing_in_detail the conversion of_the pagans, and they_were_producing great joy to_all the brothers.
\v 4 And having_arrived in G‹H‹Hierousalēm, they_were_accepted by the assembly, and the ambassadors, and the elders, and they_declared as_much_as \nd god\nd* did with them.
\v 5 But some of_the \add >ones\add* of the sect of_the G‹Farisaios_\add sect\add*›G having_believed rose_up, saying, It_is_fitting to_be_circumcising them, and to_be_commanding \add them\add* to_be_keeping the law of_G‹H‹Mōsēs.
\v 6 And the ambassadors and the elders were_gathered_together, to_see about this matter.
\v 7 And having_become much debate, G‹Petros›G having_stood_up said to them: Men, brothers, you_all are_knowing that from ancient days among you_all, \nd god\nd* chose for_the pagans to_hear by the mouth of_me, the word of_the gospel and to_believe.
\v 8 And \nd god\nd* the heart_knower testified to_them, having_given \add them\add* the holy \nd spirit\nd* as also to_us,
\v 9 and he_distinguished nothing between both us and them, having_purified the hearts of_them by_the faith.
\v 10 Therefore now why are_you_all_testing \nd god\nd*, to_put_on \add +a\add*_yoke on the neck of_the apprentices/followers, that neither the fathers of_us nor we were_able to_bear. 
\v 11 But by the grace of_the \add +the\add*_\nd master\nd* \nd G‹H‹Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a)›H›G\nd*, we_are_believing to_be_saved also_those in which manner.
\v 12 And all the multitude kept_silent, and they_were_hearing from_G‹Barnabas›G and G‹Paulos›G, explaining as_much_as \nd god\nd* did, signs and wonders among the pagans by them.
\v 13 And after them to_keep_silent, G‹H‹Yakōbos/(Ya'aqov)›H›G answered saying: Men, brothers, hear from_me.
\v 14 G‹H‹Sumeōn/(Shimə'ōn)›H›G explained as first \nd god\nd* visited, to_take out_of \add +the\add*_pagans \add +a\add*_people for_the name of_him.
\v 15 And with_this are_agreeing_together the words of_the prophets as it_has_been_written,
\v 16 After these \add >things\add* I_will_be_returning and I_will_be_rebuilding_up the tabernacle of_G‹H‹Dauid/(Dāvid)›H›G which having_fallen, and of_it having_been_overturned, I_will_be_rebuilding_up and I_will_be_restoring it,
\v 17 so_that the remnant of_the people may_seek_out the \nd master\nd*, also all the pagans, on whom has_been_called the name of_me on them, is_saying \add +the\add*_\nd master\nd* doing these \add >things\add*,
\v 18 known from eternity.
\v 19 Therefore I am_judging to_ not _be_troubling to_the \add >ones\add* from the pagans, turning_back to \nd god\nd*,
\v 20 but to_write to_them to_be_keeping_away from_the pollutions of_idols, and sexual_immorality, and the strangled \add animal\add*, and blood.
\v 21 For G‹H‹Mōsēs/(Mosheh)›H›G from ancient generations in_every city the \add >ones\add* proclaiming him, is_having being_read in the synagogues on every sabbath.
\v 22 Then it_supposed to_the ambassadors and the elders with all the assembly, having_chosen men from them, to_send \add them\add* to G‹Antioⱪeia›G with G‹Paulos›G and G‹Barnabas›G, G‹H‹Youdas/(Yəhūdāh)›H›G being_called G‹Barsabbas›G and G‹Silas›G, leading men among the brothers,
\v 23 having_written by \add +the\add*_hand of_them: the ambassadors and the elders, brothers, to_be_greeting to_the \add >ones\add* in G‹Antioⱪeia›G, and Rx-G‹H‹Suria/('Arām)›H›G-Rx, and G‹Kilikia›G, brothers from \add +the\add*_pagans.
\v 24 Since we_heard that some from us to_whom we_ not _instructed having_come_out, disturbed you_all by_ upsetting _words the hearts of_you_all,
\v 25 it_supposed to_us having_become with_one_accord, having_chosen men to_send to you_all, with G‹Barnabas›G and G‹Paulos›G the beloved of_us,
\v 26 men having_given_over the lives of_them for the name of_the \nd master\nd* of_us, \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd*.
\v 27 Therefore we_have_sent_out G‹H‹Youdas and G‹Silas›G, and them reporting the same \add >things\add* by word.
\v 28 For it_supposed to_the holy \nd spirit\nd* and to_us, nothing more burden to_be_being_laid_on on_you_all, except necessarily these \add >things\add*:
\v 29 to_be_keeping_away from_idol_sacrificed \add >things\add*, and from_blood, and from_strangled \add animals\add*, and from_sexual_immorality, from which keeping yourselves, you_all_will_be_doing well. Farewell. 
\v 30 Therefore indeed they having_been_sent_away, came_down to G‹Antioⱪeia›G, and having_gathered_together the multitude, they_handed_out the letter.
\v 31 And having_read \add it\add*, they_were_elated at the exhortation.
\v 32 Both G‹H‹Youdas and G‹Silas›G, also themselves being prophets, by much speech, exhorted the brothers and they_strengthened \add them\add*.
\v 33 And having_made \add some\add* time \add there\add*, they_were_sent_away with peace from the brothers, to the \add >ones\add* having_sent_ them _out.
\v 34
\v 35 But G‹Paulos›G and G‹Barnabas›G were_staying in G‹Antioⱪeia›G, teaching and gospel_preaching the word of_the \nd master\nd* with many others also.
\v 36 And after some days, G‹Paulos›G said to G‹Barnabas›G, indeed having_turned_back we_may_visit the brothers in every city, in which we_proclaimed the word of_the \nd master\nd*, how they_are_having.
\v 37 And G‹Barnabas›G was_wishing to_take_along_with \add them\add* also G‹Yōannēs›G, being_called Rx-G‹Markos›G-Rx.
\v 38 But G‹Paulos›G was_considering_worthy \add it\add* the \add >one\add* having_withdrawn from them from G‹Pamfulia›G and not having_come_together with_them to the work, not to_be_taking_along_with \add ~him\add* this \add >one\add*.
\v 39 And \add +a\add*_provocation became, so_as them to_be_separated from one_another, and G‹Barnabas›G having_taken Rx-G‹Markos›G-Rx, to_sail_away to G‹Kupros›G.
\v 40 But G‹Paulos›G having_chosen G‹Silas›G, came_out having_been_given_over to_the grace of_the \nd master\nd* by the brothers.
\v 41 And he_was_passing_through Rx-G‹H‹Suria/('Arām)›H›G-Rx and G‹Kilikia›G, strengthening the assemblies.
\c 16
\v 1 And he_arrived also to G‹Derbē›G and to G‹Lustra›G. And see, \add +a\add*_ certain _apprentice/follower was there by_\add +the\add*_name G‹Timotheos›G, \add +the\add*_son of_\add +a\add*_ believing _woman G‹Youdaiōns›G, but \add ^his\add*_father \add was\add* of_\add +a\add*_Rx-G‹Hellēn›G-Rx,
\v 2 who was_being_attested by the brothers in G‹Lustra›G and G‹Ikonion›G.
\v 3 G‹Paulos›G wanted this \add >one\add* to_come_out with him, and having_taken he_circumcised him, because_of the G‹Youdaiōns›G being in those places, for all had_known that the father of_him he_was_being \add +a\add*_Rx-G‹Hellēn›G-Rx.
\v 4 And while they_were_passing_through the cities, they_were_giving_over to_them the decrees to_be_keeping having_been_judged by of_the ambassadors and elders in G‹H‹Hierousalēm/(Yərūshālam)›H›G.
\v 5 Therefore indeed the assemblies were_being_strengthened in_the faith, and they_were_abounding in_number in_every day.
\v 6 And they_passed_through G‹Frugia›G and \add +the\add*_G‹Galatikos›G region, having_been_forbidden by the holy \nd spirit\nd* to_speak the word in G‹Asia›G,
\v 7 and having_come down to_G‹Musia›G, they_were_attempting to_be_gone into G‹Bithunia›G, and the \nd spirit\nd* of_\nd G‹H‹Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a)›H›G\nd* not allowed them, 
\v 8 and having_passed_by G‹Musia›G, they_came_down to Rx-G‹Trōias›G-Rx.
\v 9 And through \add +the\add*_night \add +a\add*_vision was_seen to_G‹Paulos›G, \add +a\add*_ Certain G‹from_Makedonia›G _man was having_stood and imploring him and saying: Having_passed_through into G‹Makedonia›G, give_help to_us.
\v 10 And when he_saw the vision, immediately we_sought to_come_out to G‹Makedonia›G, concluding that \nd god\nd* has_called_to us to_evangelize them.
\v 11 therefore having_been_launched from Rx-G‹Trōias›G-Rx, we_ran_straight to G‹Samothrakē›G, and on_the_ following _\add day\add* to New City,
\v 12 and_from_there to Rx-G‹Filippou›G-Rx, which is \add +the\add*_leading city of_the district of_G‹Makedonia›G, \add +a\add*_colony. And we_were staying in this city some days.
\v 13 And on_the day of_the sabbaths, we_came_out outside the gate by \add +a\add*_river, where we_were_thinking prayer to_be, and having_sat_down we_were_speaking to_the women having_come_together.
\v 14 And \add +a\add*_certain woman by_\add +the\add*_name G‹Ludia›G, \add +a\add*_seller_of_purple of_\add +the\add*_city of_G‹Thuateira›G, worshipping \nd god\nd* was_hearing, of_whom the \nd master\nd* opened_up her heart, to_be_taking_heed to_the \add >things\add* being_spoken by G‹Paulos›G.
\v 15 And when she_was_immersed and the house of_her, she_implored saying: If you_all_have_judged me to_be faithful to_the \nd master\nd*, having_come_in into the house of_me, be_remaining. And she_urged us.
\v 16 And it_became, of_us going to the prayer \add place\add*, \add +a\add*_ certain _servant_girl having \add +a\add*_ python _spirit, to_meet with_us, who fortune-telling was_bringing_about much business for_the masters of_her.
\v 17 This \add woman\add* following after_G‹Paulos›G and was_crying_out to_us saying: These men are slaves of_ The highest _\nd god\nd*, who are_proclaiming to_you_all \add +the\add*_way of_salvation.
\v 18 And she_was_doing this for many days. But G‹Paulos›G having_been_thoroughly_disturbed, and having_turned_back by_the spirit said: I_am_commanding to_you in \add +the\add*_name of_\nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd* to_come_out from her. And it_came_out to_ the _same hour.
\v 19 But the masters of_her having_seen that the hope of_the business of_them, going_out, having_taken_hold_of G‹Paulos›G and G‹Silas›G, they_dragged \add them\add* into the marketplace before the rulers,
\v 20 and having_brought_ them _forward to_the officers, they_said: These men being G‹Youdaiōns›G are_disturbing the city of_us,
\v 21 and they_are_proclaiming customs that it_is_ not _permitting for_us to_be_accepting nor to_be_practicing, being G‹Ɽōmaios›G.
\v 22 And the \add +a\add*_crowd rose_up_together against them, and the officers having_torn_off of_them the robes, were_commanding to_be_beating_with_rods \add them\add*.
\v 23 And having_inflicted many blows on_them, they_throw \add them\add* into prison, having_commanded to_the prison_guard to_be_keeping them securely, 
\v 24 who having_received such charge, throw them into the inner prison, and secured their feet of_them in the stocks.
\v 25 But to midnight, G‹Paulos›G and G‹Silas›G praying, were_singing_hymns to_\nd god\nd*, and the prisoners were_listening to_them.
\v 26 And suddenly \add +an\add*_ great _earthquake became, so_that the foundations of_the prison to_be_shaken, and immediately all the doors were_opened_up, and the bonds of_all was_unfastened.
\v 27 And the prison_guard having_become awoken, and having_seen the doors of_the prison having_been_opened_up, having_drawn his sword he_was_going to_be_killing himself, thinking the prisoners to_have_escaped.
\v 28 But G‹Paulos›G called with_\add +a\add*_ loud _voice saying: You_may_do nothing harm to_yourself, for we_are all here.
\v 29 And having_requested lights, he_rushed_in, and having_become trembling, he_fell_before to_G‹Paulos›G and G‹Silas›G.
\v 30 And having_brought_ them _forth out was_saying: Sirs, what is_fitting me to_be_doing, in_order_that I_may_be_saved. 
\v 31 And they said: Believe in the \nd master\nd* \nd G‹H‹Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a)›H›G\nd* and you_will_be_being_saved, you and the household of_you.
\v 32 And they_spoke the word of_the \nd master\nd* to_him, with all the \add >ones\add* in the house of_him.
\v 33 And having_taken them in that hour of_the night, he_washed \add them\add* from their wounds, and he_was_immersed, he and the \add >ones\add* of_him all immediately.
\v 34 And having_brought_ them _up into the house, he_set_before \add +a\add*_table \add for_them\add* and exulted with_all_the_household, having_believed in_\nd god\nd*.
\v 35 And having_become day, the officers sent_out the policemen saying: Send_away those men.
\v 36 And the prison_guard reported the words to G‹Paulos›G: The officers /Have/_sent_out, in_order_that you_all_may_be_sent_away. Therefore now having_come_out, be_going in peace.
\v 37 But G‹Paulos›G was_saying to them: Having_beat us with_publicly, uncondemned men being G‹Ɽōmaios›G, they_throw \add us\add* into prison and now secretly they_are_throwing_ us _out. For no, but having_come themselves, them_let_lead_ us _out.
\v 38 And the policemen reported these words to_the officers. And they_were_afraid having_heard that they_are G‹Ɽōmaios›G.
\v 39 And having_come, they_appealed to_them, and having_led_out \add them\add*, they_were_asking \add them\add* to_go_away From the city.
\v 40 And having_come_out from the prison, they_came_in to G‹Ludia›G, and having_seen \add them\add*, they_exhorted the brothers and they_came_out.
\c 17
\v 1 And having_traveled_through the G‹Amfipolis›G and G‹Apollōnia›G, they_came to G‹Thessalonikē›G, where was \add +a\add*_synagogue of_the G‹Youdaiōns›G.
\v 2 And according_to the \add way\add* having_been_accustomed with_G‹Paulos›G, he_came_in to them, and for Three sabbaths, he_discussed with_them from the scriptures,
\v 3 opening_up and setting_before that it_was_fitting the \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd* to_suffer, and to_rise_up from \add +the\add*_dead, and \add saying\add* This \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd*, whom I am_proclaiming to_you_all is. \nd chosen_one\nd*.
\v 4 And some of them were_persuaded and they_were_joined with_G‹Paulos›G and G‹Silas›G, both \add +a\add*_ great _multitude of_the \add >ones\add* G‹Hellēns›G worshipping, and leading \add +a\add*_few women the not.
\v 5 But the G‹Youdaiōns›G, having_been_jealous and having_taken_aside some evil men of_the marketplaces, and having_formed_a_mob, they_were_distressing the city, and having_approached to_the house of_G‹Yasōn›G, they_were_seeking them to_bring_forth to the public.
\v 6 And not having_found them, they_were_dragging G‹Yasōn›G and some brothers before the city_council shouting, The \add >ones\add* having_upset the inhabited_world, these are_coming here also,
\v 7 whom G‹Yasōn›G has_welcomed, and these all are_doing in_front_of the decrees of_Rx-G‹Kaisar›G-Rx, saying \nd G‹H‹Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a)›H›G\nd* another king to_be.
\v 8 And they_disturbed the crowd and the city_council hearing these \add >things\add*.
\v 9 And having_taken much from G‹Yasōn›G and the rest, they_sent_ them _away.
\v 10 And the brothers immediately sent_out both G‹Paulos›G and G‹Silas›G by night to G‹Beroia›G, who having_arrived, were_going into the synagogue of_the G‹Youdaiōns›G.
\v 11 And these were more_noble \add =than\add* the \add >ones\add* in G‹Thessalonikē›G, who received the word with all readiness, in_every day examining the scriptures, if these \add >things\add* might_be_having thus.
\v 12 therefore indeed Many from them believed, and not \add +a\add*_few of_the prominent Rx-G‹Hellēn›G-Rx women, and men.
\v 13 But when the G‹Youdaiōns›G from G‹Thessalonikē›G knew that also the word of_\nd god\nd* was_proclaimed by G‹Paulos›G in, G‹Beroia›G, they_came also_there, agitating and disturbing the crowds.
\v 14 And then the brothers immediately G‹Paulos›G sent_away, to_be_going as_far_as to the sea, and both G‹Silas›G and G‹Timotheos›G remained there.
\v 15 And the \add >ones\add* appointing G‹Paulos›G, brought \add ~him\add* to G‹Athēnai›G, and having_received \add +a\add*_commandment for G‹Silas›G and G‹Timotheos›G, that as they_may_come most_quickly to him, they_were_departing.
\v 16 And G‹Paulos›G in G‹Athēnai›G, of_awaiting them, the spirit of_him was_being_provoked in him, of_observing the city being idolatrous.
\v 17 Therefore he_was_discussing on_one_hand in the synagogue with_the G‹Youdaiōns›G, and the \add >ones\add* worshipping, and in the marketplace on every day with the \add >ones\add* happening_to_be.
\v 18 On_the_other_hand some also of_the G‹Epikoureios›G and G‹Stōikos›G philosophers were_conferring with_him, and some were_saying: What might_ this _be_wanting babbler to_be_saying. But the \add others\add*: He_is_supposing to_be \add +a\add*_proclaimer of_strange demons, because he_was_gospel_preaching \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* and the resurrection.
\v 19 and having_taken_hold of_him, they_brought \add ~him\add* to the G‹Areios›G Hill saying: Are_we_being_able to_know what \add =is\add* this new, teaching \add =is\add* being_spoken by you. 
\v 20 For you_are_carrying_in some_ surprising _\add words\add* to the ears of_us. Therefore we_are_wishing to_know what_all is_wanting these \add >things\add* to_be.
\v 21 (And all \add +the\add*_G‹\add >ones\add*_from_Athēnai›G and the visiting strangers were_having_opportunity in not_one other \add >thing\add*, than to_be_telling something or to_be_hearing some newer \add >thing\add*.)
\v 22 And G‹Paulos›G having_been_stood in \add +the\add*_midst of_the G‹Areios›G Hill was_saying: Men, G‹\add >ones\add*_from_Athēnai›G, I_am_perceiving in all \add >things\add* how more_superstitious you_all.
\v 23 For passing_through and observing the objects_of_worship of_you_all, I_ even _found \add +an\add*_altar on which had_been_inscribed: to_\add +an\add*_unknown \nd god\nd*. Therefore you_all_are_being_devout not_knowing which, this \add >thing\add* I am_proclaiming to_you_all.
\v 24 The \nd god\nd* having_made the earth and all the \add >things\add* in it, this \add >one\add* being \nd master\nd* of_heaven and earth, is_dwelling neither in handmade temples,
\v 25 nor is_being_healed by human hands, additionally_needing of_anything, he giving life, and breath, and the_ all _\add >things\add* to_all, 
\v 26 and he_made of one, every nation of_mankind to_be_dwelling on all \add +the\add*_face of_the earth, having_designated \add the\add* having_been_commanded times and the boundaries of_the dwelling_place of_them,
\v 27 to_be_seeking \nd god\nd*, if perhaps surely they_might_grope for_him and might_find \add ~him\add*, also surely being not far from one each of_us.
\v 28 For we_are_living in him and are_being_moved and are, as also some of_the among you_all of_\add +the\add*_poets have_said: for we_are also of_the \add >one\add* descent.
\v 29 Therefore being descent of_\nd god\nd*, we_ought not to_be_thinking about_gold or silver or \add +a\add*_stone mark of_\add +the\add*_craft and thoughts of_human_origin, to_be similar the divine.
\v 30 Therefore indeed \nd god\nd* the times of_ignorance having_overlooked, now he_is_reporting the \add >things\add* to_ all _the people everywhere to_be_repenting,
\v 31 as_much_as he_set \add +a\add*_day in which he_is_going to_be_judging the inhabited_world in righteousness, by \add +a\add*_man to_whom he_designated, having_brought_about faith to_all, having_raised_ him _up from \add +the\add*_dead.
\v 32 And having_heard \add about\add* \add +a\add*_resurrection of_\add +the\add*_dead, on_one_hand they were_mocking, on_the_other_hand they said: We_will_be_hearing from_you concerning this also again.
\v 33 Thus G‹Paulos›G came_out from \add +the\add*_midst of_them.
\v 34 But some men having_been_joined_together to_him, believed among whom both G‹Dionusios›G the G‹Areopagitēs›G, and \add +a\add*_woman by_\add +the\add*_name G‹Damaris›G, and others with them.
\c 18
\v 1 After these \add >things\add*, having_been_departed from G‹Athēnai›G, he_came to Rx-G‹Korinthos›G-Rx.
\v 2 And having_found \add +a\add*_certain Rx-G‹Youdaios›G-Rx by_\add +the\add*_name G‹Akulas›G, of_Rx-G‹Pontos›G-Rx by_descent, recently having_come from G‹Italia›G, and G‹Priskilla›G wife of_him, because_of the \add >thing\add* G‹Klaudios›G to_have_directed all the G‹Youdaiōns›G to_be_being_departed from Rx-G‹Ɽōmē›G-Rx, he_approached to_them,
\v 3 and because_of to_be the same_trade, he_was_remaining with them and they_were_working, for they_were tent_makers by_craft.
\v 4 And he_was_discussing in the synagogue on every sabbath, he_was_persuading both G‹Youdaiōns›G and G‹Hellēns›G.
\v 5 But when both G‹Silas›G and G‹Timotheos›G, came_down from G‹Makedonia›G, G‹Paulos›G was_being_occupied with_the word, testifying to_the G‹Youdaiōns›G, \nd G‹H‹Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a)›H›G\nd* to_be the \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd*.
\v 6 And opposing, them and slandering, having_shaken_off his clothes, he_said to them: The blood of_you_all \add be\add* on the head of_you_all, I \add =am\add* clean. From the \add time\add* now, I_will_be_going to the pagans.
\v 7 And having_departed from_there, he_came_in to \add +the\add*_house of_someone by_\add +the\add*_name of_G‹Titos›G G‹Youstos›G, worshipping \nd god\nd*, of_whom the house was being_next to_the synagogue.
\v 8 And G‹Krispos›G the synagogue_leader, believed in_the \nd master\nd* with all the household of_him, and many of_the G‹Korinthios›G hearing, were_believing and were_being_immersed.
\v 9 And the \nd master\nd* said in \add +the\add*_night by \add +a\add*_vision to_G‹Paulos›G: Be_ not _fearing, but be_speaking and not you_may_keep_silent,
\v 10 because I am with you, and no_one will_be_inflicting on_you to_mistreat you, because there_is many people to_me in this city.
\v 11 and he_sat_down \add +a\add*_year and six months, teaching the word of_\nd god\nd* among them.
\v 12 But G‹Galliōn›G being proconsul of_G‹Aⱪaia›G, the G‹Youdaiōns›G stood_against with_one_accord against_G‹Paulos›G, and they_led him to the tribunal
\v 13 saying, Contrary_to the law, this \add man\add* is_persuading, people to_be_worshipping \nd god\nd*.
\v 14 But G‹Paulos›G going to_be_opening_up his mouth, G‹Galliōn›G said to the G‹Youdaiōns›G: If on_one_hand it_was \add +a\add*_certain wrong or evil crime, Rx-Oh-Rx G‹Youdaiōns›G, according_to \add +the\add*_matter I_had_tolerated of_you_all, 
\v 15 on_the_other_hand if it_is questions about \add +a\add*_word, and names, and law, which \add =is\add* among you_all, you_all_will_be_seeing \add to_it\add* yourselves, I am_ not _wishing to_be \add +a\add*_judge of_these \add >things\add*.
\v 16 And he_drove_ them _away from the tribunal.
\v 17 And all having_taken_hold_of G‹Sōsthenēs›G the synagogue_leader, they_were_striking \add ~him\add* before the tribunal. But nothing of_these \add >things\add* was_caring to_G‹Galliōn›G.
\v 18 And G‹Paulos›G having_remained many days still, having_bid_goodbye to_the brothers, was_sailing_away to Rx-G‹H‹Suria/('Arām)›H›G-Rx, and with him G‹Priskilla›G and G‹Akulas›G, having_shaved his head in G‹Kegⱪreai›G, for he_was_having \add +a\add*_vow.
\v 19 And they_arrived to G‹Efesos›G, and_ he_left _those there, and himself having_come_in into the synagogue, he_discussed with_the G‹Youdaiōns›G.
\v 20 And them asking \add ~him\add* for more time to_remain, he_ not _consented,
\v 21 but having_bid_goodbye and having_said, I_will_be_returning to you_all Again, \nd god\nd* willing, he_was_launched from G‹Efesos›G.
\v 22 And having_come_down to G‹Kaisareia›G, having_gone_up and having_greeted the assembly, he_came_down to G‹Antioⱪeia›G.
\v 23 And having_worked \add +a\add*_certain time, he_came_out passing_through consecutively the G‹Galatikos›G region and G‹Frugia›G, strengthening all the apprentices/followers.
\v 24 And \add +a\add*_ certain _Rx-G‹Youdaios›G-Rx by_\add +the\add*_name G‹Apollōs›G G‹from_Alexandria›G by_descent, \add +a\add*_scholarly man, arrived to G‹Efesos›G, being powerful in the scriptures.
\v 25 This \add >one\add* was having_been_instructed the way of_the \nd master\nd*, and being_zealous in_spirit, he_was_speaking and was_teaching exactly the \add >things\add* concerning \nd G‹H‹Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a)›H›G\nd*, knowing only the immersion of_G‹Yōannēs›G.
\v 26 And this \add >one\add* began to_be_speaking_boldly in the synagogue. But having_heard from_him, G‹Priskilla›G and G‹Akulas›G took_ him _aside, and they_explained the way of_\nd god\nd* more_exactly to_him.
\v 27 And about_him wishing to_pass_through into G‹Aⱪaia›G, the brothers having_encouraged \add ~him\add*, wrote to_the apprentices/followers to_welcome him, who having_arrived, contributed much to_the \add >ones\add* having_believed through grace.
\v 28 For vigorously he_was_thoroughly_refuting publicly against_the G‹Youdaiōns›G, showing \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* to_be the \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd* by the scriptures.
\c 19
\v 1 And it_became at the \add time\add*, G‹Apollōs›G to_be in Rx-G‹Korinthos›G-Rx, G‹Paulos›G having_passed_through the upper parts, to_come_down to G‹Efesos›G and to_find some apprentices/followers,
\v 2 and said to them: having_believed you_all_received \add +the\add*_ holy _\nd spirit\nd*. And they \add said\add* to him: But we_ not_even _heard whether there_is holy \nd spirit\nd*.
\v 3 and, he_said: Therefore into what were_you_all_immersed. And they said: Into the immersion of_G‹Yōannēs›G.
\v 4 And G‹Paulos›G said: G‹Yōannēs›G immersed with_\add +a\add*_immersion of_repentance, saying to_the people that they_may_believe in the \add >one\add* coming after him this is in \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd*.
\v 5 And having_heard, they_were_immersed in the name of_the \nd master\nd* \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd*.
\v 6 And of_G‹Paulos›G having_laying_on on_them \add ^his\add*_hands, the holy \nd spirit\nd* came on them, and they_were_speaking with_tongues and were_prophesying.
\v 7 And the all were men about twelve.
\v 8 And having_come_in into the synagogue, he_was_speaking_boldly for three months, discussing and persuading concerning the kingdom of_\nd god\nd*.
\v 9 But when some were_being_hardened and were_disbelieving, speaking_evil \add of\add* the way before the multitude, having_withdrew from them he_set_apart the apprentices/followers, in_every day discussing in the school of_G‹Turannos›G.
\v 10 And this became for two years, so_that all the \add >ones\add* dwelling_in G‹Asia›G to_hear the word of_the \nd master\nd*, both G‹Youdaiōns›G and G‹Hellēns›G.
\v 11 And \nd god\nd* was_doing not having_been_ordinary miracles, by the hands of_G‹Paulos›G,
\v 12 so_that even to the \add >ones\add* ailing handkerchiefs or aprons to_be_being_carried_away from the skin of_him, and the diseases to_be_being_released from them, and the the evil spirits to_be_going_out.
\v 13 But some also the \add >ones\add* G‹Youdaiōns›G exorcists going_around attempted to_be_naming over the \add >ones\add* having the the evil spirits in_the name of_the \nd master\nd* \nd G‹H‹Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a)›H›G\nd* saying: I_am_imploring you_all, by_\nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd*, whom G‹Paulos›G is_proclaiming.
\v 14 and seven sons of_one of_G‹Skeuas›G G‹Youdaiōns›G chief_priest Were doing this.
\v 15 But the evil spirit answering said to_them: \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* I_am_knowing, and G‹Paulos›G I_am_recognizing, but who_all are you_all. 
\v 16 And the man in whom was the evil spirit having_leapt_on, on, them, having_exercised_mastership over_both, it_prevailed against against_them, so_that to_escape out_of that house naked and having_been_wounded.
\v 17 And this became known to_all, both to_G‹Youdaiōns›G and G‹Hellēns›G, the \add >ones\add* dwelling_in G‹Efesos›G, and fear fell_on on all them, and the name of_the \nd master\nd* \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* was_being_magnified.
\v 18 And many of_the \add >ones\add* having_believed, were_coming confessing and declaring the practices of_them.
\v 19 And many of_the \add >ones\add* having_practiced the magical, having_brought_together their scrolls, they_were_burning_up \add them\add* before all. And they_counted_up the prices of_them, and they_found five ten_thousand of_silver.
\v 20 Thus the word of_the \nd master\nd* was_growing with power and was_prevailing.
\v 21 And when was_fulfilled these \add >things\add*, purposed G‹Paulos›G in the \nd spirit\nd*, having_passed_through G‹Makedonia›G and G‹Aⱪaia›G, to_be_going to G‹H‹Hierousalēm/(Yərūshālam)›H›G having_said, After the \add time\add* to_become me there, it_is_fitting me also Rx-G‹Ɽōmē›G-Rx to_see.
\v 22 And having_sent_out into G‹Makedonia›G, two of_the \add >ones\add* serving unto_him, G‹Timotheos›G and G‹Erastos›G, he held_on \add +a\add*_time in G‹Asia›G.
\v 23 And concerning that time, \add +a\add*_ not little _disturbance became concerning the way.
\v 24 For \add +a\add*_certain silversmith by_\add +the\add*_name G‹Dēmētrios›G, making temples silver of_G‹Artemas›G, was_bringing_about no little business to_the craftsmen,
\v 25 whom having_convened_together also the workers about such \add >things\add*, he_said: Men, you_all_are_knowing that the prosperity to_us is from this business.
\v 26 And you_all_are_observing and are_hearing that not only G‹Efesos›G, but almost of_all G‹Asia›G, this G‹Paulos›G having_persuaded, redirected much crowd, saying that the \add >ones\add* by \add ^our\add*_hands becoming they_are not gods.
\v 27 But this is_ not only _risking_danger to_us, the trade to_come into disrepute, but also the temple of_the great goddess of_G‹Artemas›G, to_be_reckoned for nothing, but of_the greatness of_her to_be_going also to_be_being_taken_down, whom all G‹Asia›G and the inhabited_world is_worshipping.
\v 28 And having_heard, and having_become full of_rage, they_were_crying_out saying: Great \add =is\add* G‹Artemas›G of_\add +the\add*_G‹\add >ones\add*_from_Efesos›G.
\v 29 And the city was_filled of_confusion, and they_rushed with_one_accord to the theatre, having_seized G‹\add >ones\add*_from_Makedonia›G G‹Gaios›G and G‹Aristarⱪos›G, travelling_companions of_G‹Paulos›G.
\v 30 But G‹Paulos›G wishing to_come_in to the public, the apprentices/followers were_ not _allowing him.
\v 31 And some also of_the G‹Asia›Gn_rulers, being friends to_him, having_sent to him, they_were_imploring \add ~him\add* not to_give himself into the theatre.
\v 32 Therefore indeed others \add +a\add*_certain other \add >thing\add* were_crying_out, for the assembly was having_been_confounded, and the more had_ not _known for_what on_account they_had_come_together.
\v 33 And out_of the crowd they_concluded G‹Alexandros›G, of_the G‹Youdaiōns›G having_put_ him _forward. And G‹Alexandros›G having_gestured his hand, was_wanting to_be_defending to_the public.
\v 34 But having_recognized that he_is \add +a\add*_Rx-G‹Youdaios›G-Rx, cry there_became one from all, over about two hours crying_out: Great G‹Artemas›G of_\add +the\add*_G‹\add >ones\add*_from_Efesos›G. 
\v 35 And the clerk having_calmed the crowd is_saying: Men, G‹\add >ones\add*_from_Efesos›G, for who is of_\add +the\add*_people, who is_ not _knowing the city of_\add +the\add*_G‹\add >ones\add*_from_Efesos›G being temple_keeper of_the great G‹Artemas›G and of_the fallen_from_G‹Zeus›G \add image\add*. 
\v 36 Therefore these \add >things\add* being unquestionable, it_is fitting you_all to_be_being having_been_calmed, and to_be_doing nothing reckless.
\v 37 For you_all_brought these men, neither temple-robbers nor slandering the goddess of_us.
\v 38 If therefore on_one_hand G‹Dēmētrios›G and the craftsmen with him are_having \add +a\add*_matter against anyone, courts are_being_brought and there_are proconsuls, let_them_be_indicting against_one_another.
\v 39 On_the_other_hand if you_all_are_seeking_after anything concerning others, it_will_be_being_settled in the lawful assembly.
\v 40 For we_ also _are_risking_danger to_be_being_indicted of_insurrection concerning the \add day\add* today, nothing being cause, concerning which we will_ not _be_able to_give_back \add +a\add*_account concerning this disorderly_gathering. And having_said these \add >things\add*, he_sent_away the assembly.
\c 20
\v 1 And after the \add time\add* the commotion to_cease, G‹Paulos›G having_sent_for the apprentices/followers and having_greeted having_exhorted, he_came_out to_be_going to G‹Makedonia›G.
\v 2 And having_passed_through those districts, and having_exhorted them with_ much _speech, he_came to G‹Hellas›G.
\v 3 And having_worked three months, \add +a\add*_plot by the G‹Youdaiōns›G having_become to_him, going to_be_being_launched into Rx-G‹H‹Suria/('Arām)›H›G-Rx, he_became of_\add +an\add*_opinion to_be_returning through G‹Makedonia›G.
\v 4 And G‹Sōpatros›G of_Pyrrhus G‹from_Beroia›G, And of_\add +the\add*_G‹\add >ones\add*_from_Thessalonikē›G G‹Aristarⱪos›G and G‹Sekoundos›G, and G‹Gaios›G G‹from_Derbē›G, and G‹Timotheos›G, And \add +the\add*_G‹\add >ones\add*_from_G‹Asia›G›G G‹Tuⱪikos›G and G‹Trofimos›G was_accompanying. with_him.
\v 5 And these having_approached were_remaining with_us in Rx-G‹Trōias›G-Rx.
\v 6 And we sailed_away from Rx-G‹Filippou›G-Rx after the days of_non-fermented \add bread\add*, and until five days came to them at Rx-G‹Trōias›G-Rx, where we_stayed seven days.
\v 7 And on the first \add day\add* of_the week, us having_been_gathered_together to_break bread, G‹Paulos›G was_discussing with_them, going to_be_departing on_the \add day\add* of_next, and was_prolonging the speech until midnight.
\v 8 And there_were many lamps in the upper_room, where we_were having_been_gathered_together.
\v 9 And \add +a\add*_certain young_man by_\add +the\add*_name G‹Eutuⱪos›G sitting by the window, being_overcome by_ deep _sleep, as_ G‹Paulos›G _discussing on more, having_been_overcome by sleep, he_fell down from the third_story, and was_taken_up dead.
\v 10 But having_come_down, G‹Paulos›G fell_on on_him and having_embraced \add ~him\add* said: Be_ not _being_distressed, for the life of_him is in him.
\v 11 And having_gone_up, and having_broke the bread and having_tasted \add it\add*, and for having_ much _conversed until daybreak, thus he_came_out.
\v 12 And they_brought the boy living, and were_comforted not moderately.
\v 13 But we, having_approached to the ship, were_launched to G‹Assos›G, from_there going to_be_taking_up G‹Paulos›G, for thus having_been_directed, he_ himself _was going to_be_going_on_foot.
\v 14 And when he_was_encountering with_us in G‹Assos›G, having_taken_ him _up, we_came to G‹Mitulēnē›G.
\v 15 And_from_there having_sailed_away, on_the_ following _\add day\add* we_arrived opposite G‹Ⱪios›G, and on_the next \add day\add* we_arrived in G‹Samos›G, and on_the_ following _\add day\add* we_came to G‹Milētos›G.
\v 16 For G‹Paulos›G had_judged to_sail_past G‹Efesos›G, so_that may_ not _become to_him to_spend_time in G‹Asia›G, for he_was_hurrying if possible it_might_be to_him, the day of_pentecost to_become in G‹H‹Hierousalēm/(Yərūshālam)›H›G.
\v 17 And from G‹Milētos›G, having_sent to G‹Efesos›G, he_summoned the elders of_the assembly.
\v 18 And when they_arrived to him, he_said to_them: You_all are_knowing from \add +the\add*_first day from which I_set_foot_in in G‹Asia›G, how I_became with you_all the whole time,
\v 19 serving for_the \nd master\nd* with all humility, and tears, and trials, in the plots of_the G‹Youdaiōns›G having_happened, to_me, 
\v 20 how I_shrunk_back nothing of_the_ benefitting _\add >things\add* to_ not _declare to_you_all, and to_teach you_all with_publicly and in \add all\add* homes,
\v 21 testifying to_ both _G‹Youdaiōns›G and to_G‹Hellēns›G, repentance toward \nd god\nd* and faith toward the \nd master\nd* of_us, \nd G‹H‹Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a)›H›G\nd*. \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd*.
\v 22 And now see, I having_been_bound by_the \nd spirit\nd*, am_going to G‹H‹Hierousalēm, not having_known the \add >things\add* in it going_to_be_meeting with_me.
\v 23 except that the holy \nd spirit\nd* in_every city is_testifying to_me, saying that bonds and tribulations are_remaining me.
\v 24 But of_nothing account I_am_making the life precious to_myself, so_as I_may_complete the course of_me, and the service which I_received from the \nd master\nd* \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd*, to_testify the gospel of_the grace of_\nd god\nd*.
\v 25 And now see, I have_known that you_all all among whom I_passed_through proclaiming the kingdom. will_ no_longer _be_seeing. the face of_me.
\v 26 Therefore I_am_testifying to_you_all in the today day that I_am pure from the blood of_all,
\v 27 for I_ not _shrunk_back to_ not _declare all the counsel of_\nd god\nd* to_you_all.
\v 28 Be_taking_heed to_yourselves and to_all the flock, among which the holy \nd spirit\nd* set you_all overseers, to_be_shepherding the assembly of_the of_\nd god\nd*, which he_procured through his his own blood.
\v 29 I have_known that after the departure of_me heavy wolves will_be_coming_in among you_all, not sparing from_the flock,
\v 30 and from of_you_all yourselves men will_be_rising_up speaking having_been_perverted \add >things\add*, of_the \add >thing\add* to_be_drawing_out apprentices/followers after themselves.
\v 31 Therefore be_watching, remembering that night and day for_three_year, I_ not _ceased admonishing each one with tears.
\v 32 And now the \add >things\add* I_am_entrusting you_all to_\nd god\nd*, and to_the word of_the grace of_him, being_able to_build and to_give the \add +an\add*_inheritance among all the \add >ones\add* having_been_sanctified.
\v 33 I_coveted of_silver, or gold, or clothing, of_no_one.
\v 34 you_all_ yourselves _are_knowing that these hands attended to_the needs of_me and to_the \add >ones\add* being with me.
\v 35 all \add >things\add* I_showed to_you_all that thus laboring it_is_fitting to_be_taking_care of_the \add >ones\add* faltering, and to_be_remembering about_the words of_the \nd master\nd* \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* that he said: it_is more blessed, to_be_giving than to_be_receiving.
\v 36 And having_said these \add >things\add*, having_knelt the knees of_him, he_prayed with them all.
\v 37 And much weeping became of_all, and having_embraced on the neck of_G‹Paulos›G, they_were_kissing him,
\v 38 distressing most_of_all for the word which he_had_spoken that they_are_ no_longer _going to_be_observing the face of_him. And they_were_accompanying him to the ship.
\c 21
\v 1 And when it_became us to_be_launched, having_been_withdrawn from them, having_run_straight we_came to Rx-G‹Kōs›G-Rx, and on_the_ next _\add day\add* to G‹Ɽodos›G, and_from_there to G‹Patara›G.
\v 2 And having_found \add +a\add*_ship crossing_over into G‹Foinikē›G, having_boarded we_were_launched.
\v 3 And G‹Kupros›G having_appeared, and having_left it on_\add +the\add*_left, we_were_sailing to Rx-G‹H‹Suria/('Arām)›H›G-Rx and we_came_down at G‹H‹Turos/(Tsor)›H›G, for there the ship was unloading the cargo.
\v 4 And having_sought_out the apprentices/followers, we_remained_on there seven days, who were_saying by the \nd spirit\nd* to_G‹Paulos›G not to_be_setting_foot_in to G‹H‹Hierousalēm/(Yərūshālam)›H›G.
\v 5 And when it_became to_us to_finish_out the days, having_come_out we_were_journeying, wives and children accompanying with us all, as_far_as outside the city, and having_knelt the knees on the shore having_prayed,
\v 6 we_withdrew from_one_another and we_went_up into the ship, and those returned to their own \add homes\add*.
\v 7 And we, having_completed the voyage from G‹H‹Turos, arrived to G‹Ptolemais›G, and having_greeted the brothers, we_remained one day with them.
\v 8 And on_the \add day\add* of_next, having_come_out we_came to G‹Kaisareia›G, and having_come_in into the house of_Rx-G‹Filippos›G-Rx, the gospel_preacher, being of the seven, we_remained with him.
\v 9 And with_this \add man\add* were four daughters, virgins prophesying.
\v 10 And remaining_on more days, \add +a\add*_certain prophet by_\add +the\add*_name G‹Agabos›G came_down from Rx-G‹Youdaia›G-Rx,
\v 11 and having_come to us, and having_taken_up the belt of_G‹Paulos›G, having_bound of_himself the feet and the hands, he_said: The holy \nd spirit\nd* is_saying these \add >things\add*: The man of_whom is this belt, thus the G‹Youdaiōns›G in G‹H‹Hierousalēm will_be_binding, and they_will_be_giving_over \add ~him\add* into \add +the\add*_hands of_\add +the\add*_pagans.
\v 12 And when we_heard these \add >things\add*, both we and the of_\add +the\add*_locals were_imploring, him not to_be_going_up to G‹H‹Hierousalēm.
\v 13 Then G‹Paulos›G answered: What are_you_all_doing, weeping and breaking the heart of_me. For I I_am_having ready not only to_be_bound, but also to_die_off in G‹H‹Hierousalēm, for the name of_the \nd master\nd* \nd G‹H‹Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a)›H›G\nd*.
\v 14 And him not being_persuaded, we_kept_quiet having_said: The will of_the \nd master\nd* let_be_becoming.
\v 15 And after these days, having_made_preparations, we_were_going_up to G‹H‹Hierousalēm.
\v 16 And also of_the apprentices/followers from G‹Kaisareia›G came_together with us, bringing \add us\add* to_G‹Mnasōn›G \add +a\add*_certain ancient G‹from_Kupros›G apprentice/follower with whom we_may_be_lodged.
\v 17 And of_us having_become at G‹H‹Hierousalēm, the brothers gladly welcomed us.
\v 18 and on_the \add day\add* following, G‹Paulos›G was_entering with us to G‹H‹Yakōbos/(Ya'aqov)›H›G, and all the elders arrived.
\v 19 And having_greeted them, he_was_explaining by each one, of_what \nd god\nd* did among the pagans by the service of_him.
\v 20 And they having_heard were_glorifying \nd god\nd*, and they_said to_him: You_are_observing, brother, how_many myriads are among the G‹Youdaiōns›G having_believed, and they_are_ all _being zealous for_the law.
\v 21 And they_were_instructed concerning you, that you_are_teaching apostasy from G‹H‹Mōsēs/(Mosheh)›H›G all G‹Youdaiōns›G the \add >ones\add* among the pagans, saying them not to_be_circumcising their children, nor to_be_walking in_the customs.
\v 22 Therefore what is_it. Certainly they_will_be_hearing that you_have_come.
\v 23 Therefore do this, what we_are_saying to_you. Four Men are with_us, having \add +a\add*_vow for themselves.
\v 24 Having_taken these \add men\add*, be_purified with them and spend for them, in_order_that they_will_be_shaving his head, and all will_be_knowing that of_which they_have_been_instructed about you nothing is, but you_are_aligning also yourself, keeping the law.
\v 25 But concerning the pagans having_believed, we sent_out having_judged them to_be_keeping, from_the jointly idol_sacrificed \add >thing\add*, and blood, and strangled \add animals\add*, and sexual_immorality.
\v 26 Then G‹Paulos›G having_taken the men, on_the following day with them having_been_purified, was_entering into the temple, proclaiming the fulfillment of_the days of_the purification, until of_which the offering was_offered for each one of_them.
\v 27 And when the seven days were_going, to_be_being_completed, the G‹Youdaiōns›G from G‹Asia›G, having_seen him in the temple, were_confounding all the crowd, and they_laid_on their hands on him
\v 28 crying_out: Men, G‹H‹\add >ones\add*_from_Israēl/(Yisərā'ēl)›H›G, be_giving_help. This is the man, who teaching all everywhere against the people, and the law, and this place, and still also brought_in G‹Hellēns›G into the temple, and has_defiled this holy place.
\v 29 For they_were having_previously_seen G‹Trofimos›G the G‹from_Efesos›G in the city with him, whom they_were_thinking that G‹Paulos›G brought_in into the temple.
\v 30 And the whole city was_stirred, and \add +a\add*_rushing_together of_the people became, and having_taken_hold of_G‹Paulos›G, they_were_dragging him outside the temple, and immediately the doors were_shut.
\v 31 and seeking to_kill_ him _off, there_went_up \add +an\add*_allegation to_the commander of_the cohort, that all G‹H‹Hierousalēm/(Yərūshālam)›H›G is_being_confounded,
\v 32 who immediately having_taken soldiers and centurions, ran_down on them, and having_seen the commander and the soldiers, they_ceased striking G‹Paulos›G.
\v 33 Then having_neared, the commander took_hold of_him, and commanded \add ~him\add* to_be_bound with_ two _chains, and he_was_inquiring who he_might_be and what he_is having_done.
\v 34 But others, were_crying_out some other \add >thing\add* in the crowd. And him not of_being_able to_know the certain \add >thing\add* because_of the commotion, he_commanded him to_be_being_brought into the barracks.
\v 35 And when he_became to the stairs, it_happened him to_be_being_borne by the soldiers, because_of the force of_the crowd.
\v 36 For the multitude of_the people was_following crying_out: Be_Taking_ him _away.
\v 37 And going to_be_being_brought_in into the barracks, G‹Paulos›G is_saying to_the commander: is_it_permitting to_me to_say something to you. And he was_saying: You_are_knowing In_Rx-G‹Hellēn›G-Rx. 
\v 38 Consequently are you not the G‹H‹from_Aiguptos/(Miʦərayim)›H›G, who before these days, having_upset and having_led_out the four_thousand men of_the assassins into the desert. 
\v 39 But G‹Paulos›G said: On_one_hand I am \add +a\add*_G‹Youdaiōns›G \add +a\add*_man, G‹from_Tarsos›G, of_G‹Kilikia›G, \add +a\add*_citizen of_\add +an\add*_ not _insignificant city. On_the_other_hand I_am_beseeching of_you, permit to_me to_speak to the people.
\v 40 And of_ him _having_permitted, G‹Paulos›G having_stood on the stairs, gestured with_his hand to_the people, and great silence having_become, he_called_out in_his G‹Hebraios›G language saying,
\c 22
\v 1 Men, brothers, and fathers, hear to you_all now of_\add +the\add*_defense of_me.
\v 2 (And having_heard that he_was_calling_out to_them in_the G‹Hebraios›G language, they_brought_about more quietness.) And he_is_saying:
\v 3 I am \add +a\add*_ G‹Youdaiōns›G _man, having_been_born in G‹Tarsos›G of_G‹Kilikia›G, but having_been_brought_up in this city, before the feet of_G‹H‹Gamaliēl/(Gaməlī'ēl)›H›G, having_been_instructed according_to \add +the\add*_exactness of_our ancestral law, being zealous for_\nd god\nd*, as all you_all are today,
\v 4 who I_persecuted this way until death, binding and giving_over to prisons, both men and women,
\v 5 as also the chief_priest was_testifying to_me and all the council_of_elders, from whom also having_received letters to the brothers, I_was_going to G‹H‹Damaskos/(Dammeseq)›H›G, going_to_ also _bring the \add >ones\add* being there, having_been_bound to G‹H‹Hierousalēm/(Yərūshālam)›H›G, in_order_that they_may_be_punished.
\v 6 But it_became to_me journeying, and nearing to_G‹H‹Damaskos about midday, suddenly much light from the sky to_flash_around around me.
\v 7 And I_fell to the ground, and I_heard of_\add +a\add*_voice saying to_me: G‹H‹Saulos/(Shā'ūl)›H›G, G‹H‹Saulos, why are_you_persecuting me. 
\v 8 And I answered: Who are_you, master. And he_said to me: I am \nd G‹H‹Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a)›H›G\nd* the G‹from_Nazaret›G, whom you are_persecuting.
\v 9 And the \add >ones\add* being with me, on_one_hand they_saw the light, on_the_other_hand they_ not _heard the voice of_the \add >one\add* speaking to_me.
\v 10 And I_said What may_I_do, \nd master\nd*. And the \nd master\nd* said to me: Having_risen_up be_going to G‹H‹Damaskos, and_there will_be_being_spoken to_you concerning all \add >things\add* that has_been_determined for_you to_do.
\v 11 But as I_was_ not _focusing_in because_of the glory of_that light, being_led_by_hand by the \add >ones\add* being_with with_me, I_came to G‹H‹Damaskos.
\v 12 And Rx-G‹Ananias›G-Rx \add +a\add*_certain devout man according_to the law, being_attested by all the G‹Youdaiōns›G dwelling \add there\add*,
\v 13 having_come to me and having_stood_by, he_said to_me: G‹H‹Saulos, brother, receive_sight. And_I looked_up on him to_ the _same hour.
\v 14 And he said: The \nd god\nd* of_the fathers of_us appointed you to_know the will of_him, and to_see the righteous \add Rx-one-Rx\add*, and to_hear \add +the\add*_voice out_of the mouth of_him.
\v 15 Because you_will_be \add +a\add*_witness for_him to all people, of_what \add >things\add* you_have_seen and heard.
\v 16 And now why are_you_waiting. Having_risen_up, immerse and wash_away the sins of_you, having_appealed to_the name of_him.
\v 17 And it_became to_me, having_returned to G‹H‹Hierousalēm, and praying of_me in the temple, me to_become in \add +a\add*_trance,
\v 18 and to_see him saying to_me: Hurry and come_out with quickness out_of G‹H‹Hierousalēm, because they will_ not _be_accepting of_you \add +the\add*_testimony concerning me.
\v 19 And_I said: \nd master\nd*, they are_knowing that I was imprisoning and beating in the synagogues, the \add >ones\add* believing in you.
\v 20 And when the blood of_G‹Stefanos›G the witness of_you, was_being_poured_out, I_ myself _was also having_stood_by, and consenting, and keeping the clothes of_the \add >ones\add* killing him.
\v 21 And he_said to me: Be_going, because I will_be_sending_ you _away to far pagans.
\v 22 And they_were_hearing from_him until this word, and they_lifted_up the voice of_them saying: Be_taking_away such \add man\add* from the earth, for it_was_ not _befitting him to_be_living. 
\v 23 and them Crying_out, and throwing_down their clothes, and throwing dust into the air,
\v 24 the commander commanded him to_be_being_brought_in into the barracks, having_said him to_be_being_interrogated by_floggings, in_order_that he_may_know for what cause they_were_crying_out thus to_him.
\v 25 But as they_stretched_ him _out with_the straps, G‹Paulos›G said to the centurion having_stood, is_it_permitting to_you_all to_be_flogging \add +a\add*_man G‹Ɽōmaios›G and uncondemned. 
\v 26 And having_heard \add it\add* the centurion, having_approached to_the commander, he_reported saying: What are_you_going to_be_doing. For this man is \add +a\add*_G‹Ɽōmaios›G.
\v 27 And having_approached, the commander said to_him: Be_telling to_me, are you \add +a\add*_G‹Ɽōmaios›G. And he was_saying: Yes.
\v 28 and the commander answered: I this acquired citizenship of_\add +a\add*_great sum. But G‹Paulos›G was_saying: But I even have_been_born \add free\add*.
\v 29 Therefore the \add >ones\add* going to_be_interrogating him immediately withdrew from him, the also and was_ commander _afraid, having_learned that he_is \add +a\add*_G‹Ɽōmaios›G, and because he_was having_bound him.
\v 30 But on_the \add day\add* of_next, wishing to_know for_certain, why he_is_being_accused by the G‹Youdaiōns›G, he_released him, and commanded the chief_priests and all the council, to_come_together, and having_brought_down G‹Paulos›G, he_set \add ~him\add* among them.
\c 23
\v 1 And G‹Paulos›G having_looked_intently at_the council said: Men, brothers, I in_all conscience have_lived_as_citizen good to_\nd god\nd* until this day.
\v 2 And Rx-G‹Ananias›G-Rx the chief_priest commanded to_the \add >ones\add* having_stood_by him, to_be_striking the mouth of_him.
\v 3 Then G‹Paulos›G said to him: \nd god\nd* is_going to_be_striking you, wall having_been_whitewashed. And are_ you _sitting judging me according_to the law, and you_are_ violating_law _commanding me to_be_being_struck. 
\v 4 But the \add >ones\add* having_stood_by said: Are_you_insulting the chief_priest of_\nd god\nd*. 
\v 5 And G‹Paulos›G was_saying: I_had_ not _known, brothers, that he_is \add +a\add*_chief_priest, for it_has_been_written, you will_ not _be_speaking wrongly \add +a\add*_ruler of_the people of_you.
\v 6 But G‹Paulos›G having_known that one part is of_G‹Saddoukaios_\add sect\add*›G, but the \add +the\add*_other of_G‹Farisaios_\add sect\add*›G, he_was_crying_out in the council: Men, brothers, I am \add +a\add*_G‹Farisaios_\add sect_member\add*›G, \add +the\add*_son of_G‹Farisaios_\add sect\add*›G, I am_being_judged concerning \add +the\add*_hope and resurrection of_\add +the\add*_dead.
\v 7 And of_him speaking this, \add +a\add*_dissension became ˱between˲_the G‹Farisaios_\add sect\add*›G and G‹Saddoukaios_\add sect\add*›G, and the multitude was_divided.
\v 8 For indeed \add +the\add*_G‹Saddoukaios_\add sect\add*›G are_saying to_be no resurrection, neither \add +an\add*_angel, nor \add +a\add*_spirit, But \add +the\add*_G‹Farisaios_\add sect\add*›G are_confessing both.
\v 9 And \add +a\add*_ great _clamor became, and some of_the scribes of_the side of_the G‹Farisaios_\add sect\add*›G having_stood_up, they_were_contending saying: We_are_finding nothing evil in this man, and \add what\add* if \add +a\add*_spirit spoke to_him, or \add +an\add*_angel. 
\v 10 And becoming great, dissension, the commander having_been_afraid lest G‹Paulos›G may_be_torn_apart by them, commanded the army having_come_down, to_snatch him from midst of_them, and to_be_bringing \add ~him\add* into the barracks.
\v 11 But on_the following night, the \nd master\nd* having_approached to_him, said: Be_having_courage, for as you_testified the \add >things\add* about me at G‹H‹Hierousalēm/(Yərūshālam)›H›G, thus it_is_fitting you to_testify also at Rx-G‹Ɽōmē›G-Rx.
\v 12 And it_having_become day, the G‹Youdaiōns›G having_made \add +a\add*_disorderly_gathering, cursed themselves, saying neither to_eat nor to_drink, until of_which they_may_kill_off G‹Paulos›G.
\v 13 And were more \add =than\add* forty the \add >ones\add* in_this having_made conspiracy, 
\v 14 who having_approached to_the chief_priests and the elders said: ˱With˲_\add +a\add*_curse we_cursed ourselves, to_taste of_nothing until of_which we_may_kill_off G‹Paulos›G.
\v 15 Therefore now you_all with the council report to_the commander, so_that he_may_bring_ him _down to you_all, as going to_be_investigating more_exactly the \add >things\add* concerning him, and we are ready to_kill him before the \add time\add* him to_near, .
\v 16 But the son of_the sister of_G‹Paulos›G having_heard, the ambush having_arrived, and having_come_in into the barracks, he_reported \add it\add* to_G‹Paulos›G.
\v 17 And G‹Paulos›G having_called_to one of_the centurions, he_was_saying, be_bringing_up this young_man to the commander, for he_is_having something to_report to_him.
\v 18 Therefore indeed the \add >one\add* having_taken him, brought \add ~him\add* to the commander, and he_is_saying: The prisoner, G‹Paulos›G, having_called_to me, asked to_lead this young_man to you, having something to_tell to_you.
\v 19 And the commander having_taken_hold of_the hand of_him, and having_withdrawn by himself, he_was_inquiring: What is \add it\add* that you_are_having to_report to_me. 
\v 20 And he_said, The G‹Youdaiōns›G decided to_ask you, so_that tomorrow you_may_bring_down G‹Paulos›G into the council, as going to_be_inquiring something more_exactly concerning him.
\v 21 Therefore you may_ not _be_persuaded by_them, for forty of them men \add =than\add* more are_lying_in_wait him, who cursed themselves neither to_eat nor to_drink, until of_which they_may_kill him, and now they_are ready, waiting_for the promise from you.
\v 22 Therefore indeed the commander sent_away the young_man having_commanded: To_tell to_no_one that you_reported these \add >things\add* to me.
\v 23 And having_called_to some two of_the centurions, he_said: Prepare two_hundred soldiers, so_that may_be_gone as_far_as G‹Kaisareia›G, and seventy horsemen, and two_hundred spearmen for \add +the\add*_third hour of_the night.
\v 24 And mounts to_present, in_order_that having_mounted G‹Paulos›G, they_may_bring_safely_through \add ~him\add* to G‹Fēlix›G the governor,
\v 25 having_written \add +a\add*_letter, having this pattern:
\v 26 G‹Klaudios›G G‹Lusias›G, to_be_greeting to_the most_excellent governor G‹Fēlix›G.
\v 27 this man having_been_captured by the G‹Youdaiōns›G, and going to_be_being_killed by them, having_approached with their army, I_rescued \add ~him\add* having_learned that he_is \add +a\add*_G‹Ɽōmaios›G.
\v 28 And wishing to_know the charge because_of which they_were_indicting against_him, I_brought_down \add ~him\add* to the council of_them.
\v 29 Whom I_found being_indicted concerning questions of_the law of_them, but nothing having indictment worthy of_death or of_bonds.
\v 30 And having_been_divulged to_me of_\add +a\add*_plot going_to_be against the man, I_sent \add ~him\add* from them to you, having_ also _commanded to_the accusers them to_be_speaking before you.
\v 31 Therefore indeed the soldiers according_to the \add >thing\add* having_been_directed to_them, having_taken_up G‹Paulos›G, brought \add ~him\add* by night to G‹Antipatris›G.
\v 32 But on_the \add day\add* of_ next, having_allowed the horsemen to_be_going_away with him, they_returned to the barracks, 
\v 33 who having_come_in into G‹Kaisareia›G, and having_delivered_up the letter to_the governor, they_ also _presented G‹Paulos›G to_him.
\v 34 And having_read \add it\add*, and having_asked of what province he_is, and having_learned that \add he_is\add* from G‹Kilikia›G,
\v 35 he_was_saying I_will_be_thoroughly_hearing from_you: whenever also the accusers of_you may_arrive, having_commanded for_him to_be_being_guarded in the residence_of_the_governor of_Rx-G‹Hērōdēs›G-Rx.
\c 24
\v 1 And after five days, Rx-G‹Ananias›G-Rx the chief_priest came_down with some elders, and G‹Tertullos›G \add +a\add*_certain \add +an\add*_attorney, who reported to_the governor against G‹Paulos›G.
\v 2 And of_him having_been_called, G‹Tertullos›G began to_be_accusing \add ~him\add* saying: Of_great peace obtaining through you, and of_\add +the\add*_reforms becoming to_ this _nation through your provision,
\v 3 both everything and everywhere, most_excellent G‹Fēlix›G we_are_welcoming \add it\add*, with all thanksgiving.
\v 4 But in_order_that I _may_ not _be_hindering more for you, in_your gentleness I_am_imploring you to_hear from_us briefly.
\v 5 For having_found this man \add +a\add*_pestilence, and stirring insurrections to_all the G‹Youdaiōns›G in the inhabited_world, and \add +a\add*_ring_leader of_the of_the G‹Nazōraios›G sect,
\v 6 who even attempted to_profane the temple, also whom we_apprehended.
\v 7
\v 8 from whom you_will_be_able yourself, having_examined \add ~him\add* concerning all these \add >things\add*, to_know of_which \add >things\add* we are_accusing against_him.
\v 9 And the G‹Youdaiōns›G also piled_on, alleging these \add >things\add* to_be_having thus.
\v 10 And G‹Paulos›G answered, the governor having_nodded to_him to_be_speaking, this for many years you being judge to_nation Knowing, I_am_ cheerfully _defending the \add >things\add* concerning myself.
\v 11 Of_you being_able to_know that there_are not more to_me twelve days, from which I_went_up going_to_worship in G‹H‹Hierousalēm/(Yərūshālam)›H›G.
\v 12 And they_found me neither in the temple discussing with anyone or making \add +a\add*_opposition of_\add +a\add*_crowd, neither in the synagogues, nor in the city,
\v 13 nor are_they_being_able to_stand_by to_you, concerning which now they_are_accusing against_me.
\v 14 But I_am_confessing this to_you that according_to the way which they_are_calling \add +a\add*_sect, thus I_am_serving unto_the ancestral \nd god\nd*, believing in_all the \add >things\add* throughout the law and in_the \add >things\add* having_been_written in the prophets,
\v 15 having \add +a\add*_hope in \nd god\nd*, which also these themselves are_waiting_for, \add +a\add*_resurrection to_be_going going_to_be, of_\add +the\add*_righteous both and of_\add +the\add*_unrighteous.
\v 16 In this also I_ myself _am_exercising, \add +a\add*_ inoffensive _conscience to_be_having toward \nd god\nd* and people through everything.
\v 17 And through more years I_arrived going_to_make alms to the nation of_me and offerings,
\v 18 at which they_found me in the temple having_been_purified, neither with \add +a\add*_crowd, nor with commotion.
\v 19 But some G‹Youdaiōns›G from G‹Asia›G, who it_was_fitting to_be_being_present before you and to_be_accusing, if anything might_be_having against me.
\v 20 Or let_ these themselves _say, what they_found wrong, having_stood of_me before the council,
\v 21 than concerning this one voice, which I_cried_out among them having_stood: I am_being_judged by you_all today concerning \add +the\add*_resurrection of_\add +the\add*_dead.
\v 22 But G‹Fēlix›G he_put_off them, having_known more_exactly the \add >things\add* concerning the way, having_said: Whenever G‹Lusias›G the commander may_come_down, I_will_be_investigating the \add >things\add* concerning you_all, 
\v 23 having_directed to_the centurion him to_be_being_kept, and to_be_having relaxation, and to_be_forbidding no_one of_his own \add people\add* of_him to_be_attending to_him.
\v 24 But after some days, G‹Fēlix›G having_arrived with G‹Drousilla›G, his own wife being \add +a\add*_Rx-G‹Youdaios›G-Rx, he_sent_for G‹Paulos›G, and heard from_him concerning the faith in \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd*.
\v 25 But him discussing concerning righteousness, and self-control, and the judgment coming, G‹Fēlix›G having_become frightened, answered: the_ Present _\add time\add* being be_going, and having_taken time, I_will_be_summoning you.
\v 26 Together also hoping that money will_be_being_given to_him by G‹Paulos›G, therefore also more_frequently sending_for him, he_was_conversing with_him.
\v 27 But two_years having_been_fulfilled, G‹Fēlix›G received successor G‹Porkios›G G‹Fēstos›G, and wanting to_grant \add +a\add*_favour to_the G‹Youdaiōns›G, G‹Fēlix›G left G‹Paulos›G having_been_bound.
\c 25
\v 1 Therefore G‹Fēstos›G having_set_foot_in in_the province after three, days went_up to G‹H‹Hierousalēm/(Yərūshālam)›H›G from G‹Kaisareia›G.
\v 2 And the chief_priests and the leaders of_the G‹Youdaiōns›G reported to_him against G‹Paulos›G, and they_were_imploring him,
\v 3 requesting \add +a\add*_favour against him, so_that he_may_send_for him to G‹H‹Hierousalēm (making \add +an\add*_ambush to_kill him on the way).
\v 4 Therefore indeed G‹Fēstos›G answered, G‹Paulos›G to_be_being_kept in G‹Kaisareia›G, and himself to_be_going in quickness to_be_going_out.
\v 5 Therefore the powerful \add >ones\add* among you_all: he_is_saying, having_gone_down_with, if anything perverse is in the man, them _let_be_accusing against_him.
\v 6 And having_stayed among them not more eight or ten days, having_come_down to G‹Kaisareia›G, on_the \add day\add* of_next having_sat_down on the tribunal, he_commanded G‹Paulos›G to_be_brought.
\v 7 And of_him having_arrived, the G‹Youdaiōns›G having_come_down from G‹H‹Hierousalēm stood_around him, bringing_against many and heavy charges, which they_were_ not _able to_demonstrate,
\v 8 of_G‹Paulos›G defending, I_sinned neither against the law of_the G‹Youdaiōns›G, nor against the temple, nor anything against Rx-G‹Kaisar›G-Rx.
\v 9 But G‹Fēstos›G wanting to_grant favour with_the G‹Youdaiōns›G, answering to_G‹Paulos›G he_said: Are_you_willing to having_gone_up G‹H‹Hierousalēm concerning these \add >things\add* to_be_judged there before me. 
\v 10 But G‹Paulos›G said: Before the tribunal of_Rx-G‹Kaisar›G-Rx having_stood I_am, where it_is_fitting me to_be_being_judged. I_have_done_ nothing _wrong To_\add +the\add*_G‹Youdaiōns›G, as also you very_well are_knowing.
\v 11 Therefore if on_one_hand I_am_doing_wrong and I_have_done anything worthy of_death, I_am_ not _refusing to_die_off, on_the_other_hand if nothing is \add true\add* of_which these are_accusing against_me, no_one is_able to_grant me to_them. I_am_Appealing to_Rx-G‹Kaisar›G-Rx. 
\v 12 Then G‹Fēstos›G having_conversed_with with the counsel, answered: You_have_appealed to_Rx-G‹Kaisar›G-Rx, you_will_be_going to Rx-G‹Kaisar›G-Rx. 
\v 13 And some days having_elapsed, G‹Agrippas›G the king and G‹Bernikē›G arrived to G‹Kaisareia›G, having_greeted G‹Fēstos›G.
\v 14 And as they_were_staying there more days, G‹Fēstos›G placed_before before_the king the \add >things\add* concerning G‹Paulos›G saying, certain \add +a\add*_man ˱There˲_is, \add +a\add*_prisoner having_been_left by G‹Fēlix›G,
\v 15 concerning whom of_me having_become in G‹H‹Hierousalēm, the chief_priests and the elders of_the G‹Youdaiōns›G reported, requesting conviction against him, 
\v 16 to whom I_answered that it_is not \add +the\add*_custom with_G‹Ɽōmaios›G to_be_granting any person before the \add >one\add* being_accused, might_be_having to face the accusers and \add +the\add*_place of_defense might_take concerning the indictment.
\v 17 Therefore of_them having_come_together, here, having_made not_one delay, on_the_ next _\add day\add* having_sat_down on the tribunal, I_commanded the man to_be_brought, 
\v 18 concerning whom the accusers having_been_stood they_were_bringing not_one charge, of_which I was_suspecting evil \add >ones\add*.
\v 19 But they_were_having against him some questions concerning their own superstition, and concerning \add +a\add*_certain \nd G‹H‹Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a)›H›G\nd* having_died, whom G‹Paulos›G was_alleging to_be_living.
\v 20 And I perplexing, the debate concerning these \add >things\add*, was_asking if might_be_wishing to_be_going to G‹H‹Hierousalēm/(Yərūshālam)›H›G, and_there to_be_being_judged concerning these \add >things\add*.
\v 21 But G‹Paulos›G having_appealed to_be_kept himself for the investigation of_the Emperor, I_commanded him to_be_being_kept, until of_which I_may_send_ him _up to Rx-G‹Kaisar›G-Rx.
\v 22 And G‹Agrippas›G \add said\add* to G‹Fēstos›G: I_was_wishing also myself to_hear from_the man. Tomorrow, he_is_saying: you_will_be_hearing from_him.
\v 23 Therefore on_the \add day\add* of_next, G‹Agrippas›G and G‹Bernikē›G having_come with great pageantry, and having_come_in into the auditorium with both commanders and men in prominence in_the city, and having_commanded G‹Fēstos›G, G‹Paulos›G was_brought.
\v 24 And G‹Fēstos›G is_saying: king G‹Agrippas›G, and all you_all being_present_with with_us, men, you_all_are_observing this \add >one\add*, concerning whom all the multitude of_the G‹Youdaiōns›G pleaded with_me, in both G‹H‹Hierousalēm and here, shouting not to_be_fitting him to_be_living no_longer.
\v 25 But I grasped him to_have_done nothing worthy of_death, and this \add >one\add* himself having_appealed to_the Emperor, I_judged to_be_sending \add ~him\add*.
\v 26 Concerning whom I_am_ not _having any certain to_write to_my master. Therefore I_brought_ him _forth before you_all, and most_of_all before you, king G‹Agrippas›G, so_that the examination having_become, I_may_have something I_may_write.
\v 27 For it_is_supposing to_me illogical sending \add +a\add*_prisoner, not also to_signify the charges against him.
\c 26
\v 1 And G‹Agrippas›G was_saying to G‹Paulos›G: It_is_being_permitted to_you to_be_speaking concerning yourself. Then G‹Paulos›G having_stretched_out his hand was_defending,
\v 2 Concerning all of_which I_am_being_indicted by \add +the\add*_G‹Youdaiōns›G, king G‹Agrippas›G, I_have_considered myself blessed going to_be_defending before you, today.
\v 3 Most_of_all you being knowledgeable_one of_all the among \add +the\add*_G‹Youdaiōns›G, of_ both _customs and questions, therefore I_am_beseeching \add you\add* patiently to_hear from_me.
\v 4 Therefore indeed the livelihood of_me, from youth from \add +the\add*_beginning having_become among the nation of_me and in G‹H‹Hierousalēm, all G‹Youdaiōns›G have_known,
\v 5 knowing_before me originally, if they_may_be_willing to_be_testifying that according_to the most_exact sect of_our religion, I_lived \add +a\add*_G‹Farisaios_\add sect_member\add*›G.
\v 6 And now for \add +the\add*_hope of_the promise to the fathers of_us, having_become by \nd god\nd*, I_have_stood being_judged,
\v 7 to which the twelve_tribes of_us serving night and day in earnestness, is_hoping to_attain, concerning which \add +the\add*_hope I_am_being_indicted by \add +the\add*_G‹Youdaiōns›G, king.
\v 8 Why is_it_being_judged unbelievable by you_all, if \nd god\nd* is_raising \add +the\add*_dead. 
\v 9 Therefore indeed I supposed to_myself it_to_be_fitting to_do many contrary \add >things\add* to the name of_\nd G‹H‹Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a)›H›G\nd* of_G‹from_Nazaret›G.
\v 10 Which also I_did in G‹H‹Hierousalēm/(Yərūshālam)›H›G, and many both of_the holy \add >ones\add* I locked_up in prisons, having_received the authority from the chief_priests, and of_them being_killed, I_brought_ \add +a\add*_vote _against \add them\add*.
\v 11 And in all the synagogues, often punishing them, I_was_compelling \add them\add* to_be_slandering, and exceedingly raging_against against_them, I_was_persecuting \add them\add* as_far_as even to the outside cities.
\v 12 At which journeying to G‹H‹Damaskos/(Dammeseq)›H›G, with \add +the\add*_authority and permission of_the chief_priests,
\v 13 middle day on the road king I_saw, from_heaven \add +a\add*_light above the brightness \add like\add* of_the sun having_shone_around me, and the \add >ones\add* journeying with me.
\v 14 And all of_us having_falling_down to the ground, I_heard \add +a\add*_voice, saying to me in_the G‹Hebraios›G language: G‹H‹Saulos/(Shā'ūl)›H›G, G‹H‹Saulos, why are_you_persecuting me. \add It_is\add* hard for_you to_be_kicking against \add +the\add*_prods.
\v 15 And I said: Who you_are, master. And the \nd master\nd* said: I am \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd*, whom you are_persecuting.
\v 16 But rise_up, and stand on the feet of_you, for I_was_seen by_you in this, to_appoint you \add +a\add*_attendant and \add +a\add*_witness, both of_which you_saw me and of_which I_will_be_being_seen by_you,
\v 17 rescuing you from the people and from the pagans, to whom I am_sending_ you _out,
\v 18 to_open_up eyes of_them, for_that to_turn_back from darkness to light, and from_the power of_G‹H‹Satan/(Sāţān)›H›G to \nd god\nd*, for_that them to_receive forgiveness of_sins and lot among the \add >ones\add* having_been_sanctified by_faith in me.
\v 19 Whence, king G‹Agrippas›G, I_became not unpersuadable to_the heavenly vision,
\v 20 but to_the \add >ones\add* in G‹H‹Damaskos first and both, in_G‹H‹Hierousalēm, and all the region of_Rx-G‹Youdaia›G-Rx, and to_the pagans, I_was_reporting to_be_repenting and to_be_turning_back to \nd god\nd*, worthy of_ works _repentance doing.
\v 21 On_account these \add >things\add*, \add +the\add*_G‹Youdaiōns›G having_captured me in the temple, were_attempting to_hand_over \add me\add*.
\v 22 Therefore having_obtained of_help from \nd god\nd* until this day, I_have_stood testifying to_small both and to_great, nothing besides saying of_what \add >things\add* both the prophets and G‹H‹Mōsēs/(Mosheh)›H›G spoke going to_be_becoming,
\v 23 the \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd* if suffering, if first by resurrection from_\add +the\add*_dead, is_going to_be_proclaiming light both to_\add +the\add*_people and the pagans.
\v 24 And of_him defending these \add >things\add*, G‹Fēstos›G with_loud voice is_saying: You_are_raving_mad, G‹Paulos›G. The great learning is_turning you to madness. 
\v 25 But G‹Paulos›G: Is_saying I_am_ not _raving_mad: most_excellent G‹Fēstos›G, but I_am_speaking_out words of_truth and sobriety.
\v 26 For the king is_understanding concerning these \add >things\add*, to whom I_am_ also _speaking speaking_boldly, for I_am_being_persuaded nothing to_be_escaping_notice him anything of_these \add >things\add* not, for this is not having_been_done in \add +a\add*_corner.
\v 27 king G‹Agrippas›G are_you_believing, in_the prophets. I_have_known that you_are_believing.
\v 28 And G‹Agrippas›G \add said\add* to G‹Paulos›G: Are_you_persuading me in \add +a\add*_little \add time\add* to_make \add +a\add*_follower_of_the_messiah. 
\v 29 And G‹Paulos›G \add said\add*: I_might_hope to_\nd god\nd*, both in \add +a\add*_little \add time\add* and in \add +a\add*_great \add time\add*, not only you, but also all the \add >ones\add* hearing from_me today, to_become such what_kind also_I am, except of_ these _bonds.
\v 30 both the king and the governor Stood_up, both G‹Bernikē›G and the \add >ones\add* sitting_with with_them,
\v 31 and having_withdrawn they_were_speaking to one_another saying, This man any not_one worthy \add >thing\add* of_death or of_bonds is_doing.
\v 32 And G‹Agrippas›G was_saying to_G‹Fēstos›G: This man was_able to_have_sent_away, except he_had_appealed Rx-G‹Kaisar›G-Rx.
\c 27
\v 1 And when it_was_judged us to_be_sailing_away to G‹Italia›G, they_were_giving_over both G‹Paulos›G and some other prisoners, to_\add +a\add*_centurion by_\add +the\add*_name G‹Youlios›G, of_\add +the\add*_cohort of_G‹Augustus/(Sebastos)›G.
\v 2 And having_boarded on_\add +a\add*_ G‹Adramuttēnos›G _ship, we_were_launched going to_be_sailing to the places along G‹Asia›G, of_G‹Aristarⱪos›G being with us, \add +a\add*_G‹from_Makedonia›G of_G‹from_Thessalonikē›G.
\v 3 Both on_the next \add day\add* we_were_set_down at G‹H‹Sidōn/(Tsīdōn)›H›G, and G‹Youlios›G having_given_treatment with_human_kindness to_G‹Paulos›G, he_permitted \add ~him\add* having_been_gone to his friends, to_obtain of_care.
\v 4 And_from_there having_been_launched, we_sailed_under G‹Kupros›G, because_of that the winds to_be contrary.
\v 5 And having_sailed_across the sea along G‹Kilikia›G and G‹Pamfulia›G, we_came_down to G‹Mura›G of_G‹Lukia›G.
\v 6 And_there the centurion having_found \add +a\add*_ G‹from_Alexandria›G _ship, sailing to G‹Italia›G, he_placed_in us into it.
\v 7 And in many days, slow_sailing and with_difficulty, having_become along G‹Knidos›G, the wind not further_permitting us, we_sailed_under G‹Krētē›G along G‹H‹Salmōn/(Saləmōn)›H›Ge.
\v 8 And sailing_along it with_difficulty, we_came to \add +a\add*_ certain _place being_called Beautiful Harbors, to_which was near \add +the\add*_city G‹Lasaia›G.
\v 9 And much time having_elapsed, and the voyage already being dangerous, because_of that even the fasting already to_have_passed_by, G‹Paulos›G was_advising \add them\add*
\v 10 saying to_them: Men, I_am_perceiving that the voyage to_be_going going_to_be with damage and much loss, not only of_the cargo and to_the ship, but also the lives of_us.
\v 11 But the centurion was_being_persuaded by_the captain and the ship_owner rather, than by_the \add >things\add* being_spoken by G‹Paulos›G.
\v 12 And the harbor being unsuitable to winter, the more presented \add +a\add*_counsel to_be_launched from_there, if somehow they_might_be_able, having_arrived at G‹Foinix›G, to_winter \add +a\add*_harbor of_G‹Krētē›G, looking to \add +the\add*_southwest and to \add +the\add*_northwest.
\v 13 And of_\add +a\add*_south_wind having_blown_gently, having_supposed of_the purpose to_have_taken_hold, having_taken_up they_were_sailing_along near G‹Krētē›G.
\v 14 But after not much \add time\add*, \add +a\add*_ typhoon _wind, being_called \add +the\add*_G‹Eurokludōn›G throw down. from_it.
\v 15 And the ship having_been_seized, and not being_able to_be_facing to_the wind, having_given_up we_were_being_driven_along.
\v 16 And having_run_under \add +a\add*_certain island being_called G‹Klaudē›G, we_were_able with_difficulty to_become control of_the lifeboat,
\v 17 which having_taken_up, they_were_resorting to_helps, undergirding the ship. And fearing lest they_may_run_aground into the \add shallows_of\add* G‹Surtis›G, having_lowered the gear, thus they_were_being_driven_along.
\v 18 And of_us being_ violently _storm_tossed, on_the_ next _\add day\add* they_were_making \add +a\add*_jettison,
\v 19 and on_the third \add day\add*, they_threw_down the tackle of_the ship \add ^their\add*_own_hands.
\v 20 And neither sun nor stars appearing for more days, and no little storm laying_on \add us\add*, furthermore all hope, us to_be_being_saved was_being_taken_away.
\v 21 And of_much abstinence being, then G‹Paulos›G having_been_stood in midst of_them said: It_was_fitting indeed, Rx-Oh-Rx men, having_yielded to_me, not to_be_being_launched from G‹Krētē›G, and to_gain this damage, and the loss.
\v 22 And_yet now I_am_advising you_all the \add >things\add* to_be_cheering_up, for not_one loss of_life will_be of you_all, except of_the ship.
\v 23 For \add +an\add*_angel of_\nd god\nd* stood_by me this night, of_whose I_am, unto_whom also I_am_serving,
\v 24 saying: Be_ not _fearing, G‹Paulos›G, it_is_fitting you to_stand_before before_Rx-G‹Kaisar›G-Rx, and see, \nd god\nd* has_granted to_you all the \add >ones\add* sailing with you.
\v 25 Therefore be_cheering_up, men, for I_am_believing in_ \nd god\nd* that thus it_will_be, according_to which manner it_has_been_spoken to_me.
\v 26 But it_is_fitting us to_run_aground on \add +a\add*_certain island.
\v 27 But when \add +the\add*_fourteenth night became, us being_carried_through in the G‹Adrias›G_Sea, to \add +the\add*_middle of_the night, the sailors were_suspecting \add +a\add*_certain to_be_coming_near to_them land.
\v 28 And having_taken_soundings, they_found twenty fathoms, and \add +a\add*_little \add time\add* having_passed_by, and again having_taken_soundings, they_found fifteen fathoms.
\v 29 And fearing lest we_may_run_aground somewhere on rough places, having_thrown_down four anchors from \add +the\add*_stern, they_were_hoping for_day to_become.
\v 30 And \add +the\add*_sailors seeking to_flee out_of the ship, and having_lowered the lifeboat into the sea, on_under_pretense as going to_be_stretching_out anchors from \add +the\add*_bow,
\v 31 G‹Paulos›G said to_the centurion and to_the soldiers: If these may_ not _remain in the ship, you_all are_ not _being_able to_be_saved.
\v 32 Then the soldiers cut_off the ropes of_the lifeboat, and they_allowed her to_run_aground.
\v 33 And until of_which day was_going to_be_becoming, G‹Paulos›G was_exhorting all, to_partake of_food saying: Today \add +the\add*_fourteenth day \add =is\add*, you_all_are_continuing waiting foodless, having_taken nothing.
\v 34 Therefore I_am_exhorting you_all to_partake of_food, for this is_being for your salvation, for \add +a\add*_hair from the head of_no_one of_you_all will_be_perishing.
\v 35 And having_said these \add >things\add*, and having_taken bread, he_gave_thanks to_\nd god\nd* before all, and having_broke \add it\add*, he_began to_be_eating.
\v 36 And all having_become cheerful, they also received of_food.
\v 37 And we_were all souls in the ship, two_hundred seventy six.
\v 38 And having_been_satiated of_food, they_were_lightening the ship, throwing_out the wheat into the sea.
\v 39 And when day became, they_were_ not _recognizing the land, but were_observing \add +a\add*_certain bay having \add +a\add*_shore, on which they_were_counselling, if they_might_be_able to_preserve the ship.
\v 40 And having_cut_away the anchors, they_were_allowing \add them\add* in the sea, at_once having_unfastened the ropes of_the rudders, and having_lifted_up the foresail to_the \add wind\add* blowing, they_were_keeping for the shore.
\v 41 But having_fallen_among into \add +a\add*_place two_sea, they_ran_ the ship _aground, and on_one_hand the bow having_stuck remained unshakeable, on_the_other_hand the stern was_being_destroyed by the force.
\v 42 And of_the soldiers, \add +the\add*_counsel became that they_may_kill_off the prisoners, lest anyone having_swum_away may_escape.
\v 43 But the centurion wishing to_bring_ G‹Paulos›G _safely_through, forbade them of_their counsel, and he_commanded the \add >ones\add* being_able to_be_swimming, having_thrown_off \add themselves\add* first, to_be_departing on the land,
\v 44 and the rest, on_one_hand some on planks, on_the_other_hand some on some \add >things\add* from the ship. And thus it_became, all to_be_brought_safely_through to the land.
\c 28
\v 1 And having_been_brought_safely_through, then we_learned that the island is_being_called G‹Melitē›G.
\v 2 And the foreigners were_bringing_about not \add just\add* the having_been_ordinary human_kindness to_us, for having_lit \add +a\add*_fire, they_received all us, because_of the rain having_approached, and because_of the cold.
\v 3 But G‹Paulos›G having_gathered some multitude of_sticks, and having_laid_on \add them\add* on the fire, \add +a\add*_viper having_come_out from the heat, clamped_down on_the hand of_him.
\v 4 And when the foreigners saw the wild_beast being_hanged from the hand of_him, they_were_saying to one_another: Certainly this man is \add +a\add*_murderer, whom having_been_brought_safely_through from the sea, justice not allowed \add ~him\add* to_be_living.
\v 5 Therefore indeed he, having_shaken_off the wild_beast into the fire, suffered not_one harm.
\v 6 But they were_expecting him to_be_going to_be_being_swelled_up, or to_be_falling_down suddenly dead. But over much \add time\add*, them waiting and observing nothing amiss becoming to him, having_changed_their_minds they_were_saying him to_be \add +a\add*_god.
\v 7 And in the \add parts\add* about that place, was_being properties to_the leader of_the island by_\add +the\add*_name G‹Poplios›G, who having_accepted us hospitably lodged three days.
\v 8 And it_became, the father of_G‹Poplios›G to_be_lying_down being_gripped_with with_fevers and dysentery, to whom G‹Paulos›G having_come_in, and having_prayed, having_laid_on the hands on_him, he_healed him.
\v 9 And this having_become, also the rest in the island having sicknesses were_approaching and were_being_healed,
\v 10 who also they_honored us with_many honors, and being_launched, they_laid_on the \add >things\add* for our needs.
\v 11 And after three months, we_were_launched in \add +a\add*_ship having_wintered in the island, \add +an\add*_G‹from_Alexandria›G with_\add +a\add*_figurehead to_G‹Zeus›G_twins.
\v 12 And having_been_set_down at G‹Surakousai›G, we_remained_on three days,
\v 13 whence having_cut_away, we_arrived at G‹Ɽēgion›G. And after one day, having_come_on \add +a\add*_south_wind, \add +the\add*_second \add day\add* we_came to G‹Potioloi›G,
\v 14 where having_found \add +the\add*_brothers, we_were_implored by them to_remain_on seven days. And thus we_came to Rx-G‹Ɽōmē›G-Rx.
\v 15 And_from_there the brothers having_heard, the \add >things\add* concerning us, came to meeting with_us until G‹Appios›G Market and Three Taverns, whom G‹Paulos›G having_seen, having_giving_thanks to_\nd god\nd*, took courage.
\v 16 And when we_came_in to Rx-G‹Ɽōmē›G-Rx, it_was_permitted to_G‹Paulos›G to_be_remaining by himself, with the soldier guarding him.
\v 17 And it_became after three days, him to_call_together the \add >ones\add* being leaders of_the G‹Youdaiōns›G. And them having_come_together, he_was_saying to them: Men brothers I, having_done nothing contrary to_the people or the ancestral customs, \add +a\add*_prisoner from G‹H‹Hierousalēm/(Yərūshālam)›H›G was_given_over into the hands of_the G‹Ɽōmaios›G,
\v 18 who having_examined me, were_wishing to_send_away \add me\add*, because_of that not_one cause of_death to_be_being in me.
\v 19 But speaking_against of_the G‹Youdaiōns›G, I_was_compelled to_appeal to_Rx-G‹Kaisar›G-Rx, not as having anything to_be_accusing against_the nation of_me.
\v 20 Therefore for this cause, I_begged you_all, to_see and to_address, for on_account of_the hope of_Rx-G‹H‹Israēl/(Yisərā'ēl)›H›G-Rx, this chain I_am_being_encompassed \add in\add*.
\v 21 And they said to him: We neither received letters concerning you from Rx-G‹Youdaia›G-Rx, nor having_arrived anyone of_the brothers reported or spoke anything evil concerning you.
\v 22 But we_are_considering_worthy to_hear from you what you_are_thinking, for indeed concerning this sect it_is known to_us, that it_is_being_spoken_against everywhere.
\v 23 And having_determined \add +a\add*_day for_him, more they_came to him to the lodging, to_whom he_was_explaining, testifying the kingdom of_\nd god\nd*, and persuading them concerning \nd G‹H‹Yēsous/(Yəhōshū'a)›H›G\nd*, from both the law of_G‹H‹Mōsēs/(Mosheh)›H›G, and the prophets, from in_the_morning to evening.
\v 24 And on_one_hand the \add >ones\add* were_being_persuaded by_the \add >things\add* being_spoken, on_the_other_hand the \add >ones\add* were_disbelieving.
\v 25 And being discordant with one_another, they_were_sending_away, G‹Paulos›G having_spoken one \add final\add* word: Rightly the holy \nd spirit\nd* spoke by G‹H‹Ēsaias/(Yəsha'əyāh)›H›G the prophet to the fathers of_you_all
\v 26 saying: be_gone to this people, and say: ˱In˲_hearing you_all_will_be_hearing, and by_no_means you_all_may_ not _understand, and seeing you_all_will_be_seeing, and by_no_means you_all_may_ not _perceive.
\v 27 For the heart of_ this _people was_become_dull, and they_ hardly _heard with_their ears of_them, and they_shut the eyes of_them, lest they_may_see with_their eyes, and they_may_hear with_their ears, and they_may_understand with_their heart, and they_may_turn_back, and I_will_be_healing them.
\v 28 Therefore it_let_be known, to_you_all that this salvation of_\nd god\nd* was_sent_out to_the pagans, and they will_be_hearing. 
\v 29
\v 30 And He_remained_in two_ whole _years in \add ^his\add*_own rental, and was_welcoming all the \add >ones\add* entering_in to him,
\v 31 proclaiming the kingdom of_\nd god\nd*, and unhinderedly teaching the \add >things\add* concerning the \nd master\nd* \nd G‹H‹Yēsous\nd* \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd*, with all boldness.
