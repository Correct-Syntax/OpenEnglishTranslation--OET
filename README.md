# OpenEnglishTranslation (OET)

The **Open English Translation** of the Bible (OET) -- a unique, completely free and open-licensed new modern-English Bible translation

## Background

The Open English Translation project has been planned for over a decade (a draft of Jonah was done in 2010), a circumstances only now (mid-2022) allow for full-time development to begin.

The new website is forthcoming at https://OpenEnglishTranslation.Bible, but currently more information is still available at https://Freely-Given.org/BibleTranslations/English/OET/. Over the next few months, most of that information will transferred either to this repository or to the new website.

## Introduction

Perhaps one of the main differences from existing English translations that should be mentioned here is this: All translations must choose to place themselves somewhere on the line that moves from being very literal (some people might perhaps naively think this is being accurate to the original), to being more helpful to the reader by being more free/dynamic (in making a translation that fills in some of the implied information that might have been obvious to the original readers). The Open English Translation handles this by choosing two points on that line instead of just one! The two versions (one very literal and one quite dynamic) are intended to be used together (and never alone).

The other main difference, is that the Open English Translation will be made freely available for others to use and publish in Bible studies and similar materials, to print, to display on any device, and even to change/customise (with some limitations) for a specific group.

Good News: After several years of waiting, the Open English Translation is due for a restart in the second half of 2022 (as soon as the new [Statistical Restoration Greek New Testament](https://GreekCNTR.org/collation/index.htm) dataset is officially released by the [Center for New Testament Restoration](https://GreekCNTR.org)). This work will start with a review of the design, and then a focus on creating the New Testament portion of the Literal Version. Are you interested in helping or supporting this effort? If so, please use our [Contact Page](https://Freely-Given.org/Contact.html).

The Old Testament portions will be based on the work of the [Open Scriptures Hebrew Bible](https://hb.OpenScriptures.org) team.

The Open English Translation will eventually be available in five versions:

- [Literal Version](https://Freely-Given.org/BibleTranslations/English/OET/Introduction.html#OET-LV) (also see [blog](https://OpenScripture.blogspot.com/2010/05/oet-literal-version.html) announcement) which may then be printed/displayed alongside one of the:
- [Readers’ Version](https://Freely-Given.org/BibleTranslations/English/OET/Introduction.html#OET-RV) (also see [blog](https://OpenScripture.blogspot.com/2010/06/oet-readers-version.html) announcement), the
- [Colloquial Version](https://Freely-Given.org/BibleTranslations/English/OET/Introduction.html#OET-CV), the
- [Study Version](https://Freely-Given.org/BibleTranslations/English/OET/Introduction.html#OET-SV) (also see [blog](https://OpenScripture.blogspot.com/2010/06/oet-study-version.html) announcement), or the
- [Extended Version](https://Freely-Given.org/BibleTranslations/English/OET/Introduction.html#OET-EV) (also see [blog](https://OpenScripture.blogspot.com/2010/06/oet-extended-version.html) announcement), and possibly the
- _Digest Version_ for those who want the essence without some of the trivia (like Paul forgetting his coat in Troas).
